            <h2>TikTok deal is done; Trump wants praise while users fear MAGA tweaks</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-finalizes-trump-deal-that-allows-bytedance-to-maintain-some-control/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The TikTok deal is done, and Donald Trump is claiming a win, although it remains unclear if the joint venture he arranged with ByteDance and the Chinese government actually resolves Congress’ national security concerns.

In a press release Thursday, TikTok announced the “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” an entity established to keep TikTok operating in the US.

Giving Americans majority ownership, ByteDance retains 19.9 percent of the joint venture, the release said, which has been valued at $14 billion. Three managing investors—Silver Lake, Oracle, and MGX—each hold 15 percent, while other investors, including Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell’s investment firm, Dell Family Office, hold smaller, undisclosed stakes.

Americans will also have majority control over the joint venture’s seven-member board. TikTok CEO Shou Chew holds ByteDance’s only seat. Finalizing the deal was a “great move,” Chew told TikTok employees in an internal memo, The New York Times reported.

Two former TikTok employees will lead the joint venture. Adam Presser, who previously served as TikTok’s global head of Operations and Trust & Safety, has been named CEO. And Kim Farrell, TikTok’s former global head of Business Operations Protection, will serve as chief security officer.

Trump has claimed the deal meets requirements for “qualified divestiture” to avoid a TikTok ban otherwise required under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. However, questions remain, as lawmakers have not yet analyzed the terms of the deal to determine whether that’s true.

The law requires the divestment “to end any ‘operational relationship’ between ByteDance and TikTok in the United States,” critics told the NYT. That could be a problem, since TikTok’s release makes it clear that ByteDance will maintain some control over the TikTok US app’s operations.

For example, while the US owners will retrain the algorithm and manage data security, ByteDance owns the algorithm and “will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.” The Trump administration seemingly agreed to these terms to ensure that the US TikTok isn’t cut off from the rest of the world on the app.

“Interoperability enables the Joint Venture to provide US users with a global TikTok experience, ensuring US creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale,” the release said.

Perhaps also concerning to Congress, Slate noted, while ByteDance may be a minority owner, it remains the largest individual shareholder.

Michael Sobolik, an expert on US-China policy and senior fellow at the right-leaning think tank the Hudson Institute, told the NYT that the Trump administration “may have saved TikTok, but the national security concerns are still going to continue.”

Some critics, including Republicans, have vowed to scrutinize the deal.

On Thursday, Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass.) complained that the White House had repeatedly denied requests for information about the deal. They’ve provided “virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence,” Markey said.

“This lack of transparency reeks,” Markey said. “Congress has a responsibility to investigate this deal, demand transparency, and ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

In December, Representative John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House Select Committee on China, said that he wants to hold a hearing with TikTok leadership to discuss how the deal addresses national security concerns. On Thursday, Moolenaar said he “has two specific questions for TikTok’s new American owners,” Punchbowl News reported.

“Can we ensure that the algorithm is not influenced by the Chinese Communist Party?” Moolenaar said. “And two, can we ensure that the data of Americans is secure?”

Moolenaar may be satisfied by the terms, as the NYT suggested that China hawks in Washington appeared to trust that Trump’s arrangement is a qualified divestiture. TikTok’s release said that Oracle will protect US user data in a secure US cloud data environment that will regularly be audited by third-party cybersecurity experts. The algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance and retrained on US user data, the release said, and Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that the joint venture “will have control over how the algorithm pushes content to users.”

Last September, a spokesperson for the House China Committee told Politico that “any agreement must comply with the historic bipartisan law passed last year to protect the American people, including the complete divestment of ByteDance control and a fully decoupled algorithm.”

“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!” Trump said on Truth Social after the deal was finalized. “It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice.”

However, it’s unclear to TikTokers how the app might change as Trump allies take control of the addictive algorithm that drew millions to the app. Lawmakers had feared the Chinese Communist Party could influence the algorithm to target US users with propaganda, and Trump’s deal was supposed to mitigate that.

Not only do critics worry that if ByteDance maintains ownership of the algorithm, it could allow the company to continue to influence content, but there is now concern that the app’s recommendations could take a right-leaning slant under US control.

Trump has already said that he’d like to see TikTok go “100 percent MAGA,” and his allies will now be in charge of “deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down,” the NYT noted. Anupam Chander, a law and technology professor at Georgetown University, told the NYT that the TikTok deal offered Trump and his allies “more theoretical room for one side’s views to get a greater airing.”

“My worry all along is that we may have traded fears of foreign propaganda for the reality of domestic propaganda,” Chander said.

For business owners who rely on the app, there’s also the potential that the app could be glitchy after US owners start porting data and retraining the algorithm.

Trump clearly hopes the deal will endear him to TikTok users. He sought praise on Truth Social, writing, “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”

So far, the Chinese government has not commented on the deal’s finalization, but Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping in his Truth Social post “for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal.”

“He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision,” Trump said.

Experts have suggested that China benefits from the deal by keeping the most lucrative part of TikTok while the world watches it export its technology to the US.

When Trump first announced the deal in September, critics immediately attacked him for letting China keep the algorithm. One US advisor close to the deal told the Financial Times that “Trump always chickens out,” noting that “after all this, China keeps the algorithm.”

On Thursday, Sobolik told Politico that Trump “got played” by Xi after taking “terrible advice from his staff” during trade negotiations that some critics said gave China the upper hand.

Trump sees things differently, writing on Truth Social that the TikTok deal came to “a very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.”

Whether the deal is “dramatic,” “final,” or “beautiful” depends on who you ask, though, as it could face legal challenges and disrupt TikTok’s beloved content feeds. The NYT suggested that the deal took so long to finalize that TikTokers don’t even care anymore, while several outlets noted that Trump’s deal is very close to the Project Texas arrangement that Joe Biden pushed until it was deemed inadequate to address national security risks.

Through Project Texas, Oracle was supposed to oversee TikTok US user data, auditing for security risks while ByteDance controlled the code. The joint venture’s “USDS” “coinage even originated from Project Texas,” Slate noted.

Lindsay Gorman, a former senior advisor in the Biden administration, told NYT that “we’ve gone round and round and ended up not too far from where we started.”</div>

            <h2>Tesla kills Autopilot, locks lane-keeping behind $99/month fee</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/tesla-wants-recurring-revenue-discontinues-autopilot-in-favor-of-fsd/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Love it or hate it, Tesla has been responsible for helping to shape the tastes of automotive consumers over the past decade-plus. Over-the-air updates that add more features, an all-touchscreen human-machine interface, large castings, and hands-free driver assists were all introduced or popularized by Tesla’s electric vehicles, prompting other automakers to copy them, mostly in the hopes of seeing the same stratospheric gains in their stock prices. But starting on Valentine’s Day, if you want your Tesla to steer itself, you’ll have to pay a $99 monthly subscription fee.

Tesla currently offers a pair of so-called “level 2” partially automated driver assist systems. Autopilot is the older of these, combining Tesla’s adaptive cruise control (Tesla calls this TACC) and lane-keeping assist (Tesla calls this Autosteer). FSD is the newer system, meant to be more capable and for use on surface streets and divided-lane highways. Although the company and Tesla CEO Elon Musk regularly tout these systems’ capabilities, both still require the human driver to provide situational awareness.

But Autopilot has been under fire from regulators and the courts. Multiple wrongful death lawsuits are in the works, and after a high-profile loss resulting in a $329 million judgment against Tesla, expect many of these suits to be settled. Both the federal government and California have investigated whether Tesla misled customers, and in December, an administrative law judge ruled that Tesla indeed engaged in deceptive marketing by implying that its cars could drive themselves. The judge suspended Tesla’s license to sell cars in California, a decision that the California Department of Motor Vehicles stayed for 60 days.

Tesla was told that if it couldn’t resolve the deceptive marketing within those 60 days, the sales suspension would take effect. That would be bad for the automaker, as California is far and away its largest market in the US, albeit one that is shrinking each quarter. Having to suspend sales entirely in the state would be disastrous. Some had speculated that Tesla could change Autopilot’s name to something less misleading, but the company chose a more drastic approach.

Now, if you want your new Tesla to steer itself—while you pay attention to the road—you will have to pay for FSD. Until the middle of February, that can be done for a one-time fee of $8,000. But starting on February 14, that option goes away, too, and the sole choice will be a $99/month FSD subscription.

But probably not for very long. Last night, Musk revealed on his social media platform that “the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve. The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”

The quest for recurring revenue streams is becoming something of a holy grail in the automotive industry as OEMs that previously treated their customers as a single sale now hope to make themselves more attractive to investors by encouraging customers to give them regular payouts.

This may have contributed to General Motors’ decision to drop Apple CarPlay and Android Automotive. BMW has also experimented with subscription services. Tesla’s stock price remains so high that such games are probably unnecessary here, but with falling profit margins, declining sales, and the loss of emissions credits to bolster the bottom line, one can see why regular cash infusions from Tesla drivers would be desirable.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.26 of the Rocket Report! The past week has been one of advancements and setbacks in the rocket business. NASA rolled the massive rocket for the Artemis II mission to its launch pad in Florida, while Chinese launchers suffered back-to-back failures within a span of approximately 12 hours. Rocket Lab’s march toward a debut of its new Neutron launch vehicle in the coming months may have stalled after a failure during a key qualification test. We cover all this and more in this week’s Rocket Report.

Australia invests in sovereign launch. Six months after its first orbital rocket cleared the launch tower for just 14 seconds before crashing back to Earth, Gilmour Space Technologies has secured 217 million Australian dollars ($148 million) in funding that CEO Adam Gilmour says finally gives Australia a fighting chance in the global space race, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The funding round, led by the federal government’s National Reconstruction Fund Corporation and superannuation giant Hostplus with $75 million each, makes the Queensland company Australia’s newest unicorn—a fast-growth start-up valued at more than $1 billion—and one of the country’s most heavily backed private technology ventures.

Homegrown rocket… “We’re a rocket company that has never had access to the capital that our American competitors have,” Gilmour told the newspaper. “This is the first raise where I’ve actually raised a decent amount of capital compared to the rest of the world.” The investment reflects growing concern about Australia’s reliance on foreign launch providers—predominantly Elon Musk’s SpaceX—to put government, defense, and commercial satellites into orbit. With US launch queues stretching beyond two years and geopolitical tensions reshaping access to space infrastructure, Canberra has identified sovereign launch capability as a strategic priority. Gilmour’s first Eris rocket lifted off from the Bowen Orbital Spaceport in North Queensland on July 30 last year. It achieved 14 seconds of flight before falling back to the ground, a result Gilmour framed as a partial success in an industry where first launches routinely fail.

Isar Aerospace postpones test flight. Isar Aerospace scrubbed a potential January 21 launch of its Spectrum rocket to address a technical fault, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. Hours before the launch window was set to open, the German company said that it was addressing “an issue with a pressurization valve.” A valve issue was one of the factors that caused a Spectrum to crash moments after liftoff on Isar’s first test flight last year. “The teams are currently assessing the next possible launch opportunities and a new target date will be announced shortly,” the company wrote in a post on its website. The Spectrum rocket, designed to haul cargoes of up to a metric ton (2,200 pounds) to low-Earth orbit, is awaiting liftoff from Andøya Spaceport in Norway.

Geopolitics at play... The second launch of Isar’s Spectrum rocket comes at a time when Europe’s space industry looks to secure the continent’s sovereignty in spaceflight. European satellites are no longer able to launch on Russian rockets, and the continent’s leaders don’t have much of an appetite to turn to US rockets amid strained trans-Atlantic relations. Europe’s satellite industry is looking for more competition for the Ariane 6 and Vega C rockets developed by ArianeGroup and Avio, and Isar Aerospace appears to be best positioned to become a new entrant in the European launch market. “I’m well aware that it would be really good for us Europeans to get this one right,” said Daniel Metzler, Isar’s co-founder and CEO.

A potential buyer for Orbex? UK-based rocket builder Orbex has signed a letter of intent to sell its business to European space logistics startup The Exploration Company, European Spaceflight reports. Orbex was founded in 2015 and is developing a small launch vehicle called Prime. The company also began work on a larger medium-lift launch vehicle called Proxima in December 2024. On Wednesday, Orbex published a brief press release stating that a letter of intent had been signed and that negotiations had begun. The company added that all details about the transaction remain confidential at this stage.

Time’s up... A statement from Orbex CEO Phil Chambers suggests that the company’s financial position factored into its decision to pursue a buyer. “Our Series D fundraising could have led us in many directions,” said Chambers. “We believe this opportunity plays to the strengths of both businesses, and we look forward to sharing more when the time is right.” The Exploration Company, headquartered near Munich, Germany, is developing a reusable space capsule to ferry cargo to low-Earth orbit and a high-thrust reusable rocket engine. It is one of the most well-financed space startups in Europe. Orbex is one of five launch startups in Europe selected by the European Space Agency last year to compete in the European Launcher Challenge and receive funding from ESA member states. But the UK company’s financial standing is in question. Orbex’s Danish subsidiary is filing for bankruptcy, and its main UK entity is overdue in filing its 2024 financial accounts. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

A bad day for Chinese rockets. China suffered a pair of launch failures January 16, seeing the loss of a classified Shijian satellite and the failed first launch of the Ceres-2 rocket, Space News reports. The first of the two failures involved the attempted launch of a Shijian military satellite aboard a Long March 3B rocket from the Xichang launch base in southwestern China. The Shijian 32 satellite was likely heading for a geostationary transfer orbit, but a failure of the Long March 3B’s third stage doomed the mission. The Long March 3B is one of China’s most-flown rockets, and this was the first failure of a Long March 3-series vehicle since 2020, ending a streak of 50 consecutive successful flights of the rocket.

And then… Less than 12 hours later, another Chinese rocket failed on its climb to orbit. This launch, using a Ceres-2 rocket, originated from the Jiuquan space center in northwestern China. It was the first flight of the Ceres-2, a larger variant of the light-class Ceres-1 rocket developed and operated by a Chinese commercial startup named Galactic Energy. Chinese officials did not disclose the payloads lost on the Ceres-2 rocket.

Neutron in neutral. Rocket Lab suffered a structural failure of the Neutron rocket’s Stage 1 tank during testing, setting back efforts to get to the inaugural flight for the partially reusable launcher, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. The mishap occurred during a hydrostatic pressure trial, the company said Wednesday. “There was no significant damage to the test structure or facilities,” Rocket Lab added. Rocket Lab last year pushed the first Neutron mission from 2025 to 2026, citing the volume of testing ahead. The US-based company said it is now analyzing what transpired to determine the impact on Neutron launch plans. Rocket Lab said it would provide an update during its next quarterly financials, due in a few weeks.

Where to go from here?… The Neutron rocket is designed to catapult Rocket Lab into more direct competition with legacy rocket companies like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance. “The next Stage 1 tank is already in production, and Neutron’s development campaign continues,” the company said. Setbacks like this one are to be expected during the development of new rockets. Rocket Lab has publicized aggressive, or aspirational, launch schedules for the first Neutron rocket, so it’s likely the company will hang onto its projection of a debut launch in 2026, at least for now.

Falcon 9 launches NRO spysats. SpaceX executed a late night Falcon 9 launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base on January 16, carrying an undisclosed number of intelligence-gathering satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office, Spaceflight Now reports. The mission, NROL-105, hauled a payload of satellites heading to low-Earth orbit, which are believed to be Starshield, a government variant of the Starlink satellites. “Today’s mission is the twelfth overall launch of the NRO’s proliferated architecture and first of approximately a dozen NRO launches scheduled throughout 2026 consisting of proliferated and national security missions,” the NRO said in a post-launch statement.

Mysteries abound… A public accounting of the agency’s proliferated constellation suggests it now numbers nearly 200 satellites with the ability to rapidly image locations around the world. The NRO has dozens more satellites serving other functions. “Having hundreds of NRO satellites on orbit is critical to supporting our nation and its partners,” the agency said in a statement. “This growing constellation enhances mission resilience and capability through reduced revisit times, improved persistent coverage, and accelerated processing and delivery of critical data.” What was unusual about the January 16 mission is it may have only carried two satellites, well short of the 20-plus Starshield satellites launched on most previous Falcon 9 launches, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and expert tracker of global space launch activity.

Long March 12B hot-fired at Jiuquan. China’s main space contractor performed a static fire test of a new reusable Long March rocket Friday, paving the way for a test flight, Space News reports. The test-firing of the Long March 12B rocket’s first stage engines occurred on a launch pad at the Dongfeng Commercial Space Innovation Test Zone at Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China. The mere existence of the Long March 12B rocket was not publicly known until recently. The new rocket was developed by a subsidiary of the state-owned China Aerospace Science Technology Corporation, with the capacity to carry a payload of 20 metric tons to low-Earth orbit in expendable mode. It’s unknown if the first Long March 12B test flight will include a booster landing attempt.

Another one… The Long March 12B has a reusable first stage with landing legs, similar to the recovery architecture of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. The booster is designed to land downrange at a recovery zone in the Gobi Desert. The Long March 12B is the latest in a line of partially reusable Chinese rockets to reach the launch pad, following soon after the debut launches of the Long March 12A and Zhuque 3 rocket last month. Several more companies in China are working on their own reusable boosters. Of them all, the Long March 12B appears to be the closest to a clone of SpaceX’s Falcon 9. Like the Falcon 9, the Long March 12B will have nine kerosene-fueled first stage engines and a single kerosene-fueled upper stage engine. Chinese officials have not announced when the Long March 12B will launch.

Artemis II rolls to the launch pad. Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward last weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad, Ars reports. The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth.

Key test ahead… “This is the start of a very long journey,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “We ended our last human exploration of the Moon on Apollo 17.” The Artemis II mission will set several notable human spaceflight records. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen will travel farther from Earth than any human in history as they travel beyond the far side of the Moon. They won’t land. That distinction will fall to the next mission in line in NASA’s Artemis program. This will be the first time astronauts have flown on the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The launch window opens February 6, but the exact date of Artemis II’s liftoff will be determined by the outcome of a critical fueling test of the SLS rocket scheduled for early February.

Blue Origin confirms rocket reuse plan. Blue Origin confirmed Thursday that the next launch of its New Glenn rocket will carry a large communications satellite into low-Earth orbit for AST SpaceMobile, Ars reports. The rocket will launch the next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellite “no earlier than late February” from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. However, the update from Blue Origin appears to have buried the real news toward the end: “The mission follows the successful NG-2 mission, which included the landing of the ‘Never Tell Me The Odds’ booster. The same booster is being refurbished to power NG-3,” the company said.

Impressive strides… The second New Glenn mission launched on November 13, just 10 weeks ago. If the company makes the late-February target for the next mission—and Ars was told last week to expect the launch to slip into March—it will represent a remarkably short turnaround for an orbital booster. By way of comparison, SpaceX did not attempt to refly the first Falcon 9 booster it landed in December 2015. Instead, initial tests revealed that the vehicle’s interior had been somewhat torn up. It was scrapped and inspected closely so that engineers could learn from the wear and tear.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every spring, raptors return to nesting sites across northern Michigan. The smallest of these birds of prey, a falcon called the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), flies through the region’s many cherry orchards and spends its days hunting for even tinier creatures to eat. This quest keeps the kestrels fed, but it also benefits the region’s cherry farmers.

Fruit farmers have been working symbiotically with kestrels for decades, adding nesting boxes and reaping the benefits of the birds eliminating the mice, voles, songbirds, and other pests that wreak havoc by feeding on not-yet-harvested crops. In addition to limiting the crop damage caused by hungry critters, new research suggests kestrels also lower the risk of food-borne illnesses.

The study, published in November in the Journal of Applied Ecology, suggests the kestrels help keep harmful pathogens off of fruit headed to consumers by eating and scaring off small birds that carry those pathogens. Orchards housing the birds in nest boxes saw fewer cherry-eating birds than orchards without kestrels on site. This translated to an 81 percent reduction in crop damage—such as bite marks or missing fruit—and a 66 percent decrease in branches contaminated with bird feces.

“Kestrels are not very expensive to bring into orchards, but they work pretty well” at deterring unwanted bird species, said Olivia Smith, lead study author and assistant professor of horticulture at Michigan State University. “And people just like kestrels a lot, so I think it’s an attractive strategy.”

Finding a good strategy for managing pests is essential for cherry farmers. Pests cause expensive damage that worsens yields already impacted by other threats to the cherry industry, such as climate change, labor shortages, and the vagaries of international trade. To stop the added damage from pests, growers have turned to nets covering their trees, noisemakers, scarecrows, pesticides, and even the removal of natural habitats around crop-growing areas.

However, these options can be expensive and aren’t always effective. Even with these management strategies in place, birds like starlings, robins, and crows cost farms in some top cherry growing states—including Michigan, New York, Oregon, Washington, and California—about $85 million annually. For many growers, this is where the kestrels come in.

It may seem counterintuitive to solve a bird problem by bringing in more birds, but kestrels are skilled hunters whose presence drives off songbirds afraid of being eaten. Habitat loss, competition for food, and climate change are leading to slow and steady population declines for the American kestrel, losses of about 1.4 percent annually. Still, these birds are abundant enough that, in many areas of the continental United States, all farmers need to do to attract them is add a nesting box to their land.

“I’ve noticed a difference having the kestrels around, hovering over the spring crops,” said Brad Thatcher, a farmer based in Washington state who has housed kestrels on April Joy Farm, an organic fruit and vegetable farm, for over 13 years. “There’s very little fecal damage from small songbirds at that time of year versus the fall.”

With farmers who already had kestrels on their land reporting fewer songbirds and less crop damage, study authors hypothesized that food safety risks associated with pathogens birds carry may also be lower for farms harboring kestrels. To test this, the researchers evaluated 16 sweet cherry orchards in Michigan’s Leelanau and Grand Traverse counties (the latter of which is considered the “Cherry Capital of the World”). Eight of the orchards studied had nesting boxes for kestrels and eight did not.

The study authors randomly selected two areas of each orchard to search for crop damage and fecal contamination. The orchards frequented by kestrels saw the amount of damaged fruit drop from 2.5 percent to 0.47 percent. The number of crops contaminated by bird droppings also saw a three-fold decrease, falling from 6.88 percent to 2.33 percent. When researchers tested this excrement, they found that more than 10 percent contained campylobacter, a type of bacteria that is common in birds and causes food-borne illness in humans.

Campylobacter is a common cause of food poisoning and is on the rise in Michigan and around the world. It spreads to humans through food products made from, or that come into contact with, infected animals, primarily chickens and other birds. So far, only one outbreak of campylobacteriosis has been definitively linked to feces from wild birds. Still, because it causes milder symptoms than some other types of bacteria, the Centers for Disease Control considers campylobacter a significantly underreported cause of food-borne illness that may be more common than current data indicates.

“Trying to get more birds of prey would be beneficial to farmers,” Smith said. “If you have one predator, versus a bunch of prey, you have fewer birds overall. If you have a lot fewer birds, even if the ones that are there are carrying bacteria, then you can reduce the transmission risk.”

The study’s findings that kestrels significantly reduce physical damage and food safety risks on Michigan cherry farms demonstrate that managing crops and meeting conservation goals—by bolstering local kestrel populations and eliminating the need to clear wildlife habitat around agricultural areas—can be done in tandem, study authors say. They recommend farmers facing pest-management issues consider building kestrel boxes, which cost about $100 per box and require minimal maintenance.

Whether nesting boxes in a given region will be successfully inhabited by kestrels depends on whether there is an abundance of the birds there. In Michigan’s cherry-growing region, kestrels are so abundant that 80 percent to 100 percent of boxes become home for kestrels rather than other nesting birds, said Catherine Lindell, avian ecologist at Michigan State University and senior author of the study.

“It seems like this is just a great tool for farmers,” Lindell said, suggesting interested farmers “put up a couple boxes and see what happens.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Life as a startup carmaker is hard—just ask Lucid Motors.

When we met the brand and its prototype Lucid Air sedan in 2017, the company planned to put the first cars in customers’ hands within a couple of years. But you know what they say about plans. A lack of funding paused everything until late 2018, when Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund bought itself a stake. A billion dollars meant Lucid could build a factory—at the cost of alienating some former fans because of the source.

Then the pandemic happened, further pushing back timelines as supply shortages took hold. But the Air did go on sale, and it has more recently been joined by the Gravity SUV. There’s even a much more affordable midsize SUV in the works called the Earth. Sales more than doubled in 2025, and after spending a week with a model year 2026 Lucid Air Touring, I can understand why.

There are now quite a few different versions of the Air to choose from. For just under a quarter of a million dollars, there’s the outrageously powerful Air Sapphire, which offers acceleration so rapid it’s unlikely your internal organs will ever truly get used to the experience. At the other end of the spectrum is the $70,900 Air Pure, a single-motor model that’s currently the brand’s entry point but which also stands as a darn good EV.

The last time I tested a Lucid, it was the Air Grand Touring almost three years ago. That car mostly impressed me but still felt a little unfinished, especially at $138,000. This time, I looked at the Air Touring, which starts at $79,900, and the experience was altogether more polished.

The Touring features a less-powerful all-wheel-drive powertrain than the Grand Touring, although to put “less-powerful” into context, with 620 hp (462 kW) on tap, there are almost as many horses available as in the legendary McLaren F1. (That remains a mental benchmark for many of us of a certain age.)

The Touring’s 885 lb-ft (1,160 Nm) is far more than BMW’s 6-liter V12 can generate, but at 5,009 lbs (2,272 kg), the electric sedan weighs twice as much as the carbon-fiber supercar. The fact that the Air Touring can reach 60 mph (98 km/h) from a standing start in just 0.2 seconds more than the McLaren tells you plenty about how much more accessible acceleration has become in the past few decades.

At least, it will if you choose the fastest of the three drive modes, labeled Sprint. There’s also Swift, and the least frantic of the three, Smooth. Helpfully, each mode remembers your regenerative braking setting when you lift the accelerator pedal. Unlike many other EVs, Lucid does not use a brake-by-wire setup, and pressing the brake pedal will only ever slow the car via friction brakes. Even with lift-off regen set to off, the car does not coast well due to its permanent magnet electric motors, unlike the electric powertrains developed by German OEMs like Mercedes-Benz.

This is not to suggest that Lucid is doing something wrong—not with its efficiency numbers. On 19-inch aero-efficient wheels, the car has an EPA range of 396 miles (673 km) from a 92 kWh battery pack. As just about everyone knows, you won’t get ideal EV efficiency during winter, and our test with the Lucid in early January coincided with some decidedly colder temperatures, as well as larger ($1,750) 20-inch wheels. Despite this, I averaged almost 4 miles/kWh (15.5 kWh/100 km) on longer highway drives, although this fell to around 3.5 miles/kWh (17.8 kWh/100 km) in the city.

Recharging the Air Touring also helped illustrate how the public DC fast-charging experience has matured over the years. The Lucid uses the ISO 15118 “plug and charge” protocol, so you don’t need to mess around with an app or really do anything more complicated than plug the charging cable into the Lucid’s CCS1 socket.

After the car and charger complete their handshake, the car gives the charger account and billing info, then the electrons flow. Charging from 27 to 80 percent with a manually preconditioned battery took 36 minutes. During that time, the car added 53.3 kWh, which equated to 209 miles (336 km) of range, according to the dash. Although we didn’t test AC charging, 0–100 percent should take around 10 hours.

I’ll admit, I’m a bit of a sucker for the way the Air looks when it’s not two-tone. That’s the Stealth option ($1,750), and the dark Fathom Blue Metallic paint ($800) and blacked-out aero wheels pushed many of my buttons. I found plenty to like from the driver’s seat, too. The 34-inch display that wraps around the driver once looked massive—now it feels relatively restrained compared to the “Best Buy on wheels” effect in some other recent EVs. The fact that the display isn’t very tall helps its feeling of restraint here.

In the middle is a minimalist display for the driver, with touch-sensitive displays on either side. To your left are controls for the lights, locks, wipers, and so on. These icons are always in the same place, though there’s no tactile feedback. The infotainment screen to the right is within the driver’s reach, and it’s here that (wireless) Apple CarPlay will show up. As you can see in a photo below, CarPlay fills the irregularly shaped screen with a wallpaper but keeps its usable area confined to the rectangle in the middle.

The curved display floats above the textile-covered dash, and the daylight visible between them helps the cabin’s sense of spaciousness, even without a panoramic glass roof. A stowable touchscreen display lower down on the center console is where you control vehicle, climate, seat, and lighting settings, although there are also physical controls for temperature and volume on the dash. The relatively good overall ergonomics take a bit of a hit from the steeply raked A pillar, which creates a blind spot for the driver.

For all the Air Touring’s power, it isn’t a car that goads you into using it all. In fact, I spent most of the week in the gentlest setting, Smooth. It’s an easy car to drive slowly, and the rather artificial feel of the steering at low speeds means you probably won’t take it hunting apices on back roads. I should note, though, that each drive mode has its own steering calibration.

On the other hand, as a daily driver and particularly on longer drives, the Touring did a fine job. Despite being relatively low to the ground, it’s easy to get into and out of. The rear seat is capacious, and the ride is smooth, so passengers will enjoy it. Even more so if they sit up front—Lucid has some of the best (optional, $3,750) massaging seats in the business, which vibrate as well as kneading you. There’s a very accessible 22 cubic foot (623 L) trunk as well as a 10 cubic foot (283 L) frunk, so it’s practical, too.

Our test Air was fitted with Lucid’s DreamDrive Pro advanced driver assistance system ($6,750), which includes a hands-free “level 2+” assist that requires you to pay attention to the road ahead but which handles accelerating, braking, and steering. Using the turn signal tells the car to perform a lane change if it’s safe, and I found it to be an effective driver assist with an active driver monitoring system (which uses a gaze-tracking camera to ensure the driver is doing their part).

Lucid rolled out the more advanced features of DreamDrive Pro last summer, and it plans to develop the system into a more capable “level 3” partially automated system that lets the driver disengage completely from the act of driving, at least at lower speeds. Although that system is some ways off—and level 3 systems are only road-legal in Nevada and California right now anyway—even the current level 2+ system leverages lidar as well as cameras, radar, and ultrasonics, and the dash display does a good job of showing you what other vehicles the Air is perceiving around it when the system is active.

As mentioned above, the model year 2026 Air feels polished, far more so than the last Lucid I drove. Designed by a refugee from Tesla, the car promised to improve on the EVs from that brand in every way. And while early Airs might have fallen short in execution, the cars can now credibly be called finished products, with much better fit and finish than a few years ago.

I’ll go so far as to say that I might have a hard time deciding between an Air or an equivalently priced Porsche Taycan were I in the market for a luxury electric four-door, even though they both offer quite different driving experiences. Be warned, though, like with the Porsche, the options can add up quickly, and the resale prices can be shockingly low.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The world’s oldest surviving rock art is a faded outline of a hand on an Indonesian cave wall, left 67,800 years ago.

On a tiny island just off the coast of Sulawesi (a much larger island in Indonesia), a cave wall bears the stenciled outline of a person’s hand—and it’s at least 67,800 years old, according to a recent study. The hand stencil is now the world’s oldest work of art (at least until archaeologists find something even older), as well as the oldest evidence of our species on any of the islands that stretch between continental Asia and Australia.

Archaeologist Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency, and his colleagues have spent the last six years surveying 44 rock art sites, mostly caves, on Sulawesi’s southeastern peninsula and the handful of tiny “satellite islands” off its coast. They found 14 previously undocumented sites and used rock formations to date 11 individual pieces of rock art in eight caves—including the oldest human artwork discovered so far.

About 67,800 years ago, someone stood in the darkness of Liang Metanduno and placed their hand flat against the limestone wall. They, or maybe a friend, then blew a mixture of pigment and water onto the wall, covering and surrounding their hand. When they pulled their hand carefully away from the rock, careful not to disturb the still-wet paint, they left behind a crisp outline of their palm and fingers, haloed by a cloud of deep red.

The result is basically the negative of a handprint, and it’s a visceral, tangible link to the past. Someone once laid their hand on the cave wall right here, and you can still see its outline like a lingering ghost, reaching out from the other side of the rock. If you weren’t worried about damaging the already faded and fragile image, you could lay your hand in the same spot and meet them halfway.

Today, the stencil is so faded that you can barely see it, but if you look closely, it’s there: a faint halo of reddish-orange pigment, outlining the top part of a palm and the base of the fingers. A thin, nearly transparent layer of calcite covers the faded shape, left behind by millennia of water dripping down the cave wall. The ratio of uranium and thorium in a sheet of calcite suggests that it formed at least 71,000 years ago—so the outline of the hand beneath it must have been left behind sometime before that, probably around 67,800 years ago.

That makes Liang Metanduno the home of the oldest known artwork in the world, beating the previous contender (a Neanderthal hand stencil in Spain) by about 1,100 years.

“These findings support the growing view that Sulawesi was host to a vibrant and longstanding artistic culture during the late Pleistocene epoch,” wrote Oktaviana and his colleagues in their recent paper.

The karst caves of Sulawesi’s southwestern peninsula, Maros-Pangkep, are a treasure trove of deeply ancient artwork: hand stencils, as well as drawings of wild animals, people, and strange figures that seem to blend the two. A cave wall at Liang Bulu’Sipong 4 features a 4.5-meter-long mural of humanlike figures facing off against wild pigs and dwarf buffalo, and a 2024 study pushed the mural’s age back to 51,200 years ago, making it the second-oldest artwork that we know of (after the Liang Metanduno hand stencil in the recent study).

Archaeologists have only begun to rediscover the rock art of Maros-Pangkep in the last decade or so, and other areas of the island, like Southeast Sulawesi and its tiny satellite islands, have received even less attention—so we don’t know what’s still there waiting for humanity to find again after dozens of millennia. We also don’t know what the ancient artist was trying to convey with the outline of their hand on the cave wall, but part of the message rings loud and clear across tens of millennia: At least 67,800 years ago, someone was here.

The hand stencil on the wall of Liang Metanduno is, so far, the oldest evidence of our presence in Wallacea, the group of islands stretched between the continental shelves of Asia and Australia. Populating these islands is “widely considered to have involved the first planned, long-distance sea crossing undertaken by our species,” wrote Oktaviana and his colleagues.

Back when the long-lost artist laid their hand on the wall, sea levels were about 100 meters lower than they are today. Mainland Asia, Sumatra, and Borneo would have been high points in a single landmass, joined by wide swaths of lowlands that today lie beneath shallow ocean. The eastern shore of Borneo would have been a jumping-off point, beyond which lay several dozen kilometers of water and (out of view over the horizon) Sulawesi.

The first few people may have washed ashore on Sulawesi on some misadventure: lost fishermen or tsunami survivors, maybe. But at some point, people must have started making the crossing on purpose, which implies that they knew how to build rafts or boats, how to steer them, and that land awaited them on the other side.

Liang Metanduno pushes back the timing of that crossing by nearly 10,000 years. It also lends strong support to arguments that people arrived in Australia earlier than archaeologists had previously suspected. Archaeological evidence from a rock shelter called Madjedbebe, in northern Australia, suggests that people were living there by 65,000 years ago. But that evidence is still debated (such is the nature of archaeology), and some archaeologists argue that humans didn’t reach the continent until around 50,000 years ago.

“With the discovery of rock art dating to at least 67,800 years ago in Sulawesi, a large island on the most plausible colonization route to Australia, it is increasingly likely that the controversial date of 65,000 years for the initial peopling of Australia is correct,” Griffith University archaeologists Adam Brumm, a coauthor of the recent study, told Ars.

Archaeologists are still trying to work out exactly when, where, and how the first members of our species made the leap from the continent of Asia to the islands of Wallacea and, eventually, via several more open-water crossings, to Australia. Our picture of the process is pieced together from archaeological finds and models of ancient geography and sea levels.

“There’s been all sorts of work done on this (not by me), but often researchers consider the degree of intervisibility between islands, as well as other things like prevailing ocean currents and wind directions, changes in sea levels and how this affects the land area of islands and shorelines and so on,” Brumm said.

Most of those models suggest that people crossed the Makassar Strait from Borneo to Sulawesi, then island-hopped through what’s now Indonesia until they reached the western edge of New Guinea. At the time, lower sea levels would have left New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand as one big land mass, so getting from New Guinea to what’s now Australia would actually have been the easy part.

There’s a sense of deep, deep time in Liang Metanduno. The cave wall is a palimpsest on which the ancient hand stencil is nearly covered by a brown-hued drawing of a chicken, which (based on its subject matter) must have been added sometime after 5,000 years ago, when a new wave of settlers brought domesticated chickens to the island. It seems almost newfangled against the ghostly faint outline of the Paleolithic hand.

A few centimeters away is another hand stencil, done in darker pigment and dating to around 21,500 years ago; it overlays a lighter stencil dating to around 60,900 years ago. Over tens of thousands of years, generations of people returned here with the same impulse. We have no way of knowing whether visitors 21,500 years ago, or 5,000 years ago might have seen a more vibrantly decorated cave wall than what’s preserved today—but we know that they decided to leave their mark on it.

And the people who visited the cave 21,500 years ago shared a sense of style with the artists who left their hands outlined on the wall nearly 40,000 years before them: both handprints have slightly pointed fingers, as if the artist either turned their fingertip or just touched-up the outline with some paint after making the stencil. It’s very similar to other hand stencils, dated to around 17,000 years ago, from elsewhere on Sulawesi, and it’s a style that seems unique to the island.

“We may conclude that this regionally unique variant of stencil art is much older than previously thought,” wrote Oktaviana and his colleagues.

And Homo sapiens wasn’t the first hominin species to venture as far as Indonesia; at least 200,000 years earlier, Homo erectus made a similar journey, leaving behind fossils and stone tools to mark that they, too, were once here. On some of the smaller islands, isolated populations of Homo erectus started to evolve along their own paths, eventually leading to diminutive species like Homo floresiensis (the O.G. hobbits) on Flores and Homo luzonensis on Luzon. Homo floresiensis co-discoverer Richard Roberts has suggested that other isolated hominin species may have existed on other scattered islands.

Anthropologists haven’t found any fossil evidence of these species after 50,000 years ago, but if our species was in Indonesia by nearly 68,000 years ago, we would have been in time to meet our hominin cousins.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Tesla launched its Robotaxi service last summer, it came with an embarrassing caveat. Sitting in the front of each of the vehicles were human “safety monitors” who stuck out like sore thumbs — contradicting CEO Elon Musk’s promises that the service would hit the road fully driverless. That the silent human employees sat in the front passenger seat, instead of the driver’s, only served to further underscore how Musk had speciously weaseled his way out being true to his word.

Now, over half a year into the service’s launch, Musk insists that Robotaxis will start giving rides in Austin, Texas “with no safety monitor in the car,” he announced on his website X on Thursday. This comes about a month after fans spotted several of the cabs driving around without any occupants, prompting Musk to confirm that fully driverless testing was underway.

But hold your horses and runaway self-driving cars, because this appears to be another bit of deception. The EV blog Electrek reports that instead of supervising from inside the vehicle, it now appears that the safety monitors are simply watching from a car that follows the Robotaxis throughout their entire trips — a Rube Goldberg-style workaround that illustrates the lengths Musk will go to keep up a charade of progress.

According to Electrek, this new operating procedure can be seen in a vlog shared by Tesla enthusiast Joe Tegtmeyer on Thursday, which shows two black Teslas conspicuously tailing the red Robotaxi. Tegtmeyer himself comments on it during the video, calling them a “chase car” that he suspects are there for “validation.”

Tesla has struggled to refine its self-driving technology, including its Robotaxi software. The driverless-but-not-quite-superviserless cabs have already gotten into numerous accidents, have been spotted ignoring speed limits and other traffic laws, on top of instances of driving dangerously or erratically. The human monitors have also been forced to make interventions to prevent a potential accident, and have even at times taken complete control of the vehicles.

Musk once said Tesla was being “paranoid” about Robotaxi safety, and the automaker is clearly caught in a tug of war in which it knows that its tech isn’t ready for primetime, but also has to show some semblance of keeping up with Musk’s promised timelines, which include claiming that the Robotaxi service would have over 1,000 cars in its fleet “within a few months” — it currently only has around 30 — and that over a million self-driving Teslas would be deployed across the US by the end of 2026.

His latest announcement only highlighted that there was “no safety monitor in the car” and made no mention of the tailing vehicles. While you can’t fault Tesla for going the safe route by still supervising its cabs, absurd as its new methods are, it’s clearly misleading its fans and investors into thinking it’s on the pathway to full autonomy. Having an extra vehicle tail every Robotaxi obviously can’t be scaled up if those promised thousands end up roaming cities across the country.

            <h2>Experts Warn That There’s Something Wrong With the Moon Rocket NASA Is About to Launch With Astronauts Aboard</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/experts-warn-moon-rocket-nasa-heat-shield">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In less than two weeks, NASA is scheduled to launch its Artemis 2 mission, the first crewed journey to the Moon in over half a century. The Space Launch Rocket has already been rolled out to the launch pad, setting the stage for a historic mission.

While the crew won’t be attempting to land on the lunar surface this time around — that milestone is reserved for Artemis 3 — it’s an extremely ambitious and highly complex mission.

And as CNN reports, some experts aren’t convinced of NASA’s reassurances that the Orion spacecraft that will carry the astronauts is safe to use.

Specifically, NASA has spent years since its successful uncrewed Artemis 1 mission studying how the extreme temperatures during reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere affect Orion’s heat shield.

The Orion capsule sustained major damage after making its return in 2022. It cracked and chipped as a result of the extreme conditions during reentry.

Over two years after the mission concluded, NASA said it had identified the root cause, with engineers determining that the “gases generated inside the heat shield’s ablative outer material called Avcoat were not able to vent and dissipate as expected.”

“This allowed pressure to build up and cracking to occur, causing some charred material to break off in several locations,” the agency wrote in a December 2024 statement.

Yet instead of making major material changes to the heat shield itself after the fact — the Artemis 2 heat shield was assembled and installed even before the Artemis 1 mission — NASA opted to adjust the Artemis 2 mission’s flight path instead, to ensure a gentler reentry.

“Based on the data, we have decided — NASA unanimously and our decision-makers — to move forward with the current Artemis II Orion capsule and heat shield, with a modified entry trajectory,” former NASA administrator Bill Nelson announced at the time.

But not everybody is convinced that the space agency has sufficiently addressed the issue ahead of its first crewed Moon mission.

“What they’re talking about doing is crazy,” former NASA astronaut and heat shield expert Charlie Camarda told CNN.

Camarda has since teamed up with several other NASA research scientists, calling on the agency to heed their warnings.

“We could have solved this problem way back when,” he told the broadcaster. “Instead, they keep kicking the can down the road.”

NASA made changes to the way it applied the special Avcoat material to the Orion capsule from a honeycomb-like structure, as applied during Apollo missions, to larger blocks in order to simplify manufacturing, testing and installing it.

The material is designed to char and erode during “skip reentry,” a maneuver that NASA uses in which the spacecraft skips over the atmosphere like a stone before diving in. However, when it dipped back in during Artemis 1, gases built up below the heat shield, causing it to crack and break off.

The space agency is adamant that its new reentry path for Artemis 2 won’t result in gases building up in a similar manner.

“We won’t go as high on that skip, it’ll just be a loft,” Artemis flight director Rick Henfling told CNN.

Still, Camarda and other former NASA astronauts and engineersare warning that there could still be danger.

“The reason this is such a big deal is that when the heat shield is spalling — or you have big chunks coming off — even if the vehicle isn’t destroyed, you’re right at the point of incipient failure now,” thermal protection materials expert and NASA veteran Dan Rasky told CNN. “It’s like you’re at the edge of the cliff on a foggy day.”

How much of a danger a cracked heat shield poses remains a subject of debate.

“Will the heat shield crack? Yes, it’s going to crack,” former NASA astronaut Danny Olivas, who worked on the heat shield investigation, told CNN.

Nonetheless, Olivas is convinced that NASA did enough. Even if it were to crack, he says, the space agency built in redundancies in the form of several layers of defense below the Avcoat layer that will keep astronauts safe.

“I think in my mind, there’s no flight that ever takes off where you don’t have a lingering doubt,” he added. “But NASA really does understand what they have. They know the importance of the heat shield to crew safety, and I do believe that they’ve done the job.”

NASA’s recently sworn-in administrator, Jared Isaacman, is equally convinced.

“We have modified our reentry profile,” he told CNN affiliate WESH last week. “We have regained margin to safety, and I feel very good about that with Artemis 2.”

            <h2>Metal Band Releases New Album on N64 Cartridge</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year saw the highest vinyl record sales since 1984, signaling a strong desire among music enthusiasts to return to a simpler time of physical media.

Even cassette tapes are making a comeback, with major artists including Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift releasing their material on the iconic plastic, four-inch audio reels.

Now, self-described “party slam” metal band Party Cannon is taking the nostalgia play — often framed as an act of defiance against greedy and AI-slop-infested streaming platforms — to a new level.

The Scottish outfit announced that its new EP, “Subjected to a Partying,” will launch on a Nintendo N64 cartridge. Inventory, however, will be limited to just 100 copies.

“We are going where no slamming death metal band has gone before — Nintendo 64,” the band wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. “That’s right, it’s time to get N or get out.”

“To celebrate Daryl ‘The Frogman’ Boyce’s first release as our new vocalist, we decided to make it something truly special, and there’s nothing more special than a console that’s lifespan ended in 2001,” the band wrote.

The band appears to have touched a nerve, selling out its US inventory of the unique cartridges in less than a day.

It’s not exactly an ideal format for a new music release. Nintendo’s 64 Game Pak can hold up to just 64 megabytes, and the earliest versions were limited to a paltry 12 megabytes. Besides, you’ll need an N64 console and a TV with the right input to play the record.

As a result of those technical limitations, Party Cannon had to get creative, limiting the cartridge release to just four songs, while the full release will feature eight, including live tracks and remixes. However, the ROMs will also feature live video of a recent festival appearance at an era-appropriate resolution of just 320 by 240 pixels.

“Load up your N64 and have an IQ-lowering blast from the past,” reads the band’s tongue-in-cheek description on their website.

The audio quality has also taken a hit, judging by the band’s colorful description.

“[Vocalist] The Frogman sounds like unfettered pressurized sewerage pouring all over these tracks, and we couldn’t be happier with how disgusting these vocals are, it’s a new era of Party Slam,” the band gloated in its announcement.

It’s not the first time the metal band has released its music on an outdated gaming system. Last year, the band released a single on the Sega Genesis cartridge, a 16-bit console that was discontinued in 1999.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, a University of Alaska, Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained by police after ripping off pieces of AI-generated art that were hung up at a student art exhibit — and chewing them up in protest.

As the school’s student newspaper The Sun Star reported, undergraduate student Graham Granger was arrested for criminal mischief after masticating at least 57 of the 160 images that had been carefully arranged by fine arts student Nick Dwyer.

The incident was an eyebrow-raising illustration of the collective exhaustion with being surrounded by the outputs of generative AI, a fierce debate that has gripped the art world. Some, like Dwyer, see it as a powerful tool for self-expression. Others, like Granger, argue it’s quite the opposite, undermining human authorship and taking away from artists who don’t use AI for their work.

Now, in an interview with The Nation, Granger, a film and performing arts major, has spoken out about what motivated him to turn his teeth into weapons against the AI onslaught.

“It’s a protest against the school’s AI policy specifically and it’s performance art because I needed something that would elicit a reaction,” he told the publication. “So this could reach more people.”

It’s unclear which policy Granger was referring to exactly. The University of Alaska’s academic misconduct policy states that “work that is created by an artificial intelligence engine is covered by the student code of conduct.”

“Work submitted for credit that was created by AI-engines can be addressed using the academic misconduct portion of the student code of conduct,” the policy reads.

However, whether arts students are allowed or encouraged to make use of the tech remains unclear.

Granger also revealed that his act wasn’t premeditated, admitting that he didn’t even “know about the exhibit before that day.”

But once he spotted Dwyer’s work, a series of AI-generated images that explore “AI psychosis” and the crafting of false memories, he was appalled at what he saw, particularly when contrasted with other, non-AI art displayed at the exhibit.

“And then I saw the AI piece and it was just — as an artist myself, it was insulting to see something of such little effort alongside all these beautiful pieces in the gallery,” Granger told The Nation. “It shouldn’t be acceptable for this ‘art,’ if you will, to be put alongside these real great pieces.”

“It’s art that takes away from its own substance by not being made by the artist himself,” he argued.

“I think artificial intelligence is a very valuable tool,” Granger said. “I think that it has no place in the arts. It takes away a lot of the human effort that makes art.”

Dwyer appears to have a very different take on the matter. His defaced exhibit was meant to explore his own struggles with “AI psychosis,” a recently-coined term used by health professionals to describe the experience of people experiencing delusional episodes after using AI tools like ChatGPT.

Before they were chewed up by Granger, the pictures depicted Dwyer and his AI chatbot, which he says he fell in love with.

The incident left a bad taste in Dwyer’s mouth — sorry — comparing it in his remarks to The Nation to slashing someone’s tires to protest the oil industry.

However, Dwyer has since decided to drop the charges against Granger, admitting that he’s been trying to rely on generative AI less.

“I’m trying to wean myself off,” he told The Nation.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With a major winter storm about to blast pretty much every US state east of the Rocky Mountains, many are scrambling to prepare for the cold, ice, and snow.

And according to popular meteorology influencer Max Schuster, there’s yet another winter-weather hazard to watch out for: trees exploding in the frigid air.

On a viral post on X-formerly-Twitter, Schuster — who holds a meteorology degree and goes by “Max Velocity” on social media — declared an area of “exploding tree risk” across the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and northern Michigan.

“Exploding trees are possible in the Midwest and Northern Plains on Friday and Saturday, as temperatures are forecasted to fall 20 degrees below zero!” Schuster warned.

While the claim may sound far fetched, a number of legitimate publications have come out of the woodwork to back the assertion, suggesting that sap and moisture from within the trees can indeed expand so rapidly that the tree’s structure simply can’t hold it.

As with anything originating from the internet, the reality is more mundane than viral post suggests. Yes, it can and does happen — though midwestern forests aren’t about to start popping like corn kernels.

In an attempt to clear things up, Bill McNee, a forest health specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it’s not unheard of for rapid temperature drops to cause “frost cracks” in trees, which can be accompanied by a loud and unsettling “bang.”

“It’s going to get cold enough that this sap may actually finally freeze. And when it does that, like ice cubes in your freezer, they expand very quickly,” McNee told the Sentinel. “That just creates a lot of physical pressure that can lead to the frost cracking appearing suddenly, branches can fall off, and people hear this really loud crack from their tree, almost like it’s a gunshot.”

While these frost cracks can be large enough to cause a tree’s exterior tissue to literally explode, McNee says it’s “extremely rare.”

“I’ve never seen the damage of it,” McNee continued, “but from what I have seen and what I read online is that it is rare for there just to be so much pressure that is suddenly released inside this tree that it almost does explode.”

            <div id="article-text">If we were a top executive at X-formerly-Twitter, a social media site used by hundreds of millions of people which is known for its incredible levels of toxicity and ruthless trolling, we’d probably avoid sharing too many details from our personal lives on there — but that’s just us.

Anyway, on Wednesday, X’s head of product Nikita Bier shared some of the grueling tribulations inflicted on him by an uncooperative chunk of chicken, earning him instant ridicule.

“Ate a piece of fried chicken tonight. It somehow tore part of my throat going down,” Bier wrote in a now-deleted tweet. “Now I can barely swallow (or speak.)”

Adding to his woes, Bier said the doctor told him he couldn’t get an endoscopy for at least four to six weeks.

“This feels like a Kafka novel,” Bier added. (Is it just us, or is Kafka in the air this week?)

It certainly sucks to not be able to see a doctor for what could be a serious medical issue. But Bier’s tale earned little sympathy — and heapings of mockery — from X users. And it became a newsworthy enough item on there that it earned an official Grok-edited summary in the site’s trending tab, which also includes dozens of viral tweets roasting Bier’s (in)ability to chew food.

Much of the jeering centered on how culinary blockages appeared to be a recurring problem for Bier. In late December 2023, for example, Bier posted about how he had to go to the emergency room after getting a “piece of steak” stuck in his throat for four hours, which was dislodged within minutes after he was given a glucagon injection. (“Doctors are Gods,” Bier enthused at the time.)

Weeks later, Bier made another post complaining about the $1,400 bill he was slapped with after visiting a doctor for yet another piece of steak that got stuck in his throat, which just so happened to dislodge itself before the doctor could actually treat him.

A consultant who’s worked for numerous tech adjacent firms and has been hailed as a “king of virality,” Bier was appointed as head of product by Elon Musk in June last year, amid X losing advertisers and bleeding users. At the time, Bier joked he had “posted my way to the top.”

Before joining, Bier had also served as an adviser for the app Protector, a rent-a-mercenary service that allows you to hire a private detail of armed guards and drivers. Bier bluntly called it “Uber with guns.”

His time at X so far doesn’t appear to have really moved the needle much, as the site’s user base continues to be in steady decline over half a year on, with some data suggesting it’s been overtaken by Threads, Meta’s Twitter clone. But at least the users who’ve stuck around like him, right?

“The only man keeping this site afloat is someone who doesn’t seem to realize he needs to chew his food,” mocked one user. Another patronizingly described him as if he were a snake. “Nikita Bier dislocates his jaw and swallows food unchewed, relying on his powerful gastric acid to break down the meals over several weeks,” the user wrote. Brutal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google Photos will now let you make memes with your own images. On Thursday, Google introduced a new generative AI-powered feature called “Me Meme,” which will allow you to combine a photo template and an image of yourself to generate an image of the meme.

The new feature, which will be first available to U.S.-based users, was originally spotted in development last October by the blog Android Authority. It was formally announced by Google via its Photos Community site on Thursday.

The &quot;Me meme&quot; feature which I spotted back in October 2025 is finally announced by Google. This is an experimental feature which will be available first for users in US only 😐Here is the announcement forum posts- https://t.co/7P2JgJhoBk https://t.co/E60prcqcie pic.twitter.com/sFICxzVIPU

According to Google, the feature is experimental, so generated images “may not perfectly match the original photo.” It suggests uploading well-lit, focused, and front-facing photos to get the best results.

The addition is meant to just be a fun way to explore your photos and experiment with Google’s Gemini AI technology, and specifically Nano Banana. Google’s popular AI image model powers other AI features in the Google Photos app, like the ability to re-create images in new styles, such as cartoons or paintings.

Though a fairly unserious addition, all things considered, these types of features help remind users to return to the Photos app whenever they want to play around with AI tools, rather than going to a competitor’s product.

Plus, users tend to gravitate toward features that show themselves in AI edits, as OpenAI found with its successful launch of the Sora app, which lets you make AI videos that can include yourself and your friends.

“Me Meme” isn’t fully rolled out, so you may not see it in your updated Google Photos app just yet. When available, it will appear under the “Create” tab, Google says. A rep for Google told TechCrunch the feature will reach U.S. iOS and Android users over the “coming weeks.”

To use the feature, you’ll select a template or upload your own, then tap “add photo” and “Generate.” Google notes that more templates are being added over time. After the AI creates the image, you can save the photo, share it on other platforms, or tap “regenerate” to have it re-imagine the image a second time.

            <h2>Meta pauses teen access to AI characters ahead of new version</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/meta-pauses-teen-access-to-ai-characters-ahead-of-new-version/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta today said that it is pausing teens’ access to its AI characters globally across all its apps. The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts but wants to develop an updated version of AI characters for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.

The move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go to trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of not making an effort to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. Wired reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media’s impact on teen mental health.

In October, the company previewed parental controls for AI characters, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters. These features were set to release this year, but the company is now turning off AI characters altogether for teens while it updates the AI characters to a newer version.

Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.

The company has been cracking down on teens’ access to AI content in its apps. Also in October, Meta rolled out parental control features on Instagram, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps. These features, which were inspired by the PG-13 movie rating, restricted teen access to certain topics like extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.

“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready. This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company said in an updated blog post.

Meta added that when it rolls out the new AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.

Social media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is also facing a trial next week, where the platform is accused of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.

Besides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18. In November, the startup said it would build interactive stories for kids. In the last few months, OpenAI added new teen safety rules for ChatGPT and started predicting a user’s age to apply content restrictions.

Correction: This post was updated to clarify the new version of AI characters will be accessible to everyone, not just teens, when it launches. It will include parental controls.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.

On Thursday, January 22, 2026, TikTok announced that the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC had officially been established to comply with President Trump’s executive order that approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. Now, ByteDance will own less than 20% of the new entity, with the rest of it falling into non-Chinese ownership.

Over the years, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension, facing uncertainty about how their access to the app would change — for creators who use TikTok to make a living, the stakes were even higher. Last year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store on February 2, 2025.

A number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after President Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle finally ceased. In December 2025, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.

Earlier in 2025, President Trump had announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.

ByteDance will retain nearly a 20% stake in the company, while non-Chinese investors will hold the remaining 80% of ownership of the TikTok USDS Joint Venture.

The managing investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. These three investors will each hold 15% of the U.S. operation, or 45% collectively.

Other investors, which include existing ByteDance investors, make up another 35% of the venture’s ownership. This includes the Dell Family Office (Michael Dell’s investment firm), Susquehanna affiliate Vastmere, Alpha Wave Partners, and several more, which are listed in TikTok’s press release.

Reports estimate that TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion — a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.

The newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.

Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to a memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.

A White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.

ByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.

Since the deal was only just finalized, it’s not clear exactly how the 200 million American TikTok users will be impacted.

While earlier reports suggested that U.S. users might need to transition to a new platform, more recent reports have denied this claim, assuring users that they will not need to download a new app.

It’s also unclear how users’ algorithmic feeds will be impacted at this time.

To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.

The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.

A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.

Things began to progress even more following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.

In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.

Fast-forward to 2024: Trump had a change of heart since his first term and sought to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.

There were several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok, a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group had the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters included Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.

Another group, called the American Investor Consortium, was led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.

Others in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ryan Mitchell, the founder of a startup called Space Beyond, remembers looking at the night sky while camping at a state park and wondering what he should do next.

A manufacturing engineer who worked on NASA’s space shuttle program before spending nearly a decade at Jeff Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, Mitchell was considering his options. In those jobs, he had seen the cost to access space come down dramatically, thanks in large part to Blue Origin’s rival SpaceX. Those stars in the sky, he thought, seemed closer than ever.

Mitchell told TechCrunch that an idea finally clicked when he was attending a family member’s ash-spreading ceremony.

“When it was over, we were kind of like, ‘now what?’ The moment was gone,” he said. He remembered thinking: “How could I do this better?”

That, he said, was the beginning of building Space Beyond and its “Ashes to Space” program, which will use a CubeSat, a class of miniature cube-shaped satellites, to send as many as 1,000 people’s ashes to space in one go. On Thursday, Space Beyond announced it signed a launch services agreement with Arrow Science and Technology, which will integrate the CubeSat on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission scheduled for October 2027.

Sending people’s ashes to space is not a new idea. Companies like Celestis have been doing it since the 1990s. What Mitchell said is different about Space Beyond is that it’s doing it affordably — with its cheapest offering coming in at just $249. Other options typically cost in the thousands of dollars. (That said, customers will need to have the cremation performed elsewhere.)

Mitchell said Space Beyond has achieved this a few ways. Foremost is the rideshare model, which has greatly democratized access to space in general. Companies can now develop small CubeSats that get integrated into larger spacecraft for a fraction of the total price to hitch a ride on a Falcon 9, allowing for all sorts of new science and small-scale commercial missions.

But Space Beyond is also bootstrapped and not trying to generate big returns for investors.

“I’ve been told I’m not charging enough for this service,” he said, especially when considering how the funeral industry is built around over-charging people at one of their most vulnerable moments. “But I’m not looking to take over the world, and I’m not looking to make a billion dollars doing this.”

There are limits to what Space Beyond can offer, given the CubeSat format. For one, customers will only be able to send about one gram’s worth of ashes to space. This allows for the startup to fit enough customers’ ashes on board to make the idea financially viable. But it’s also a result of the fact that — despite the easier access to space — weight is still a huge consideration for launch providers like SpaceX.

Space Beyond’s CubeSat will also only be in orbit for about five years, so this is not a memorial that will last forever.

But Mitchell said there are benefits to this approach. The company’s CubeSat will be in what’s known as a “sun-synchronous orbit,” which is at a very high altitude of around 550 kilometers (or around 341 miles). This allows the satellite to fly over the entire globe. With many modern spacecraft tracking services available, customers should be able to locate the CubeSat and know when it is in the night sky above their home.

A five-year limit also means that the aluminum CubeSat and the ashes onboard will ultimately meet a fiery end as it burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere upon re-entry — a nice symbolic ending, Mitchell said, even if there’s no guarantee that customers will be able to see the resulting fireball.

Space Beyond will also never physically spread a customer’s ashes in space. That would be “almost a nightmare scenario,” Mitchell said, as the particles could create a debris cloud that could doom other spacecraft. But given that customers can only send around one gram per space, they’ll be able to do what they want with the rest of a loved one’s ashes.

When Mitchell left Blue Origin last year, he said he filled “several pages” of a notebook with ideas of what to do next. The range was wide, including options like trying to be a launch director at another space company, or becoming a Kava bartender. Something kept pulling him back to this one, though.

“I tried to talk myself out of [this idea] for a long time. I thought it would be too expensive or too difficult,” he explained. But he said it just made sense to him “every time I put actual engineering rigor to it, figured out what the requirements are, and what the business case is.”

It was also the idea that he was clearly most obsessed with. “My wife said: ‘I could have told you that weeks ago. You can’t stop talking about this,’” he said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/microsoft-gave-fbi-a-set-of-bitlocker-encryption-keys-to-unlock-suspects-laptops-reports/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.

Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.

But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.

The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.

A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.

Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.

“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emily is a college student by day, but she works the night shift at the strip club to pay her tuition — she doesn’t think anyone will find out her secret, until one day, her mysterious English teacher shows up! Did he recognize her? Will her secret get out? Pay 60 “tokens” to see what happens next, or you can watch an ad, or… just buy a VIP pass for $20 per week and skip the ads altogether.

These stories are pulpy and exaggerated, bursting with cringeworthy acting and writing. Yet these “microdramas” — TikTok-like shows with episodes about a minute long — are making billions of dollars a year.

First popular in China, microdrama apps are poised to have a breakout year in the U.S. app market. According to the app intelligence firm Appfigures, ReelShort reached roughly $1.2 billion in gross consumer spending in 2025, up 119% from 2024; another leading app, DramaBox, made $276 million in gross consumer spending last year, more than doubling its 2024 numbers.

The market doesn’t appear to be slowing down. TikTok just launched its own standalone microdrama app called PineDrama, and a new app from Hollywood veterans called GammaTime just raised $14 million, including checks from angel investors like Alexis Ohanian, Kris Jenner, and Kim Kardashian.

It’s surprising to see short-form, scripted drama apps achieve such success when we’re only five years removed from the implosion of Quibi. Quibi wanted to be like Netflix, but with 10-minute episodes that were designed to be watched on the go. Founded by Dreamworks co-founder and former Disney chair Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi raised more than $1.75 billion in funding from major Hollywood studios, then created shows with stars like Liam Hemsworth, Reese Witherspoon, and Anna Kendrick.

No one wanted Quibi, and the app turned into a punchline because of how massively it flopped. But ReelShort –- an app whose top shows are called “My Sister Is the Warlord Queen” and “In Love with a Single Farmer-Daddy” –- is a hit.

“How are they succeeding where Quibi failed? They’re basically OnlyFans for the female gaze,” Eric Wei, creator economy expert and CEO of Karat Financial, told TechCrunch. “They do romantasy, where the titles are all like, ‘My Alpha.’ This is like ‘50 Shades of Grey,’ but for vertical video.”

OnlyFans isn’t the best comparison (these shows can be suggestive, though not pornographic), but Wei is right that sex sells. When a story seems like it might be heating up, you’ll be prompted to watch ads or pay money to keep going. But the payoff is never that compelling, so you keep watching, only to see another pop-up asking for more money, or other ambiguous in-app currency.

The business model behind these apps replicates the same dark patterns as mobile games. They’re designed to get users hooked on free content, giving out free in-app currency for logging in each day. As people spend more time on the app — which is designed to be addictive — they need more coins or tokens to unlock more episodes of a show, but there’s no way to earn enough to get their fix without shelling out real money.

Sometimes a microdrama is interactive, allowing viewers to choose which route the story will take — but the good option (the woman stands up to her abusive ex) will cost tokens, while the less satisfying one (the abusive ex faces no consequences for his actions) is free.

Soon, a hooked viewer may relent and pay for the weekly $20 ad-free pass, which, after a month, would cost more than subscriptions to HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Paramount Plus combined.

As AI enters the picture, these companies will churn out content at an even more alarming pace. LLMs are not capable of writing prestige dramas like HBO’s “Succession,” or even a sitcom like “The Big Bang Theory,” but the most successful microdramas are so predictable and formulaic that they don’t actually require much human wit and creativity. You’d be shocked to learn how many microdramas begin with a scene in which a girl with glasses gets pushed down by a mean classmate, only to be saved by some popular jock, who notices she’s actually really pretty if she just takes off her glasses.

PocketFM, the Lightspeed-backed audio-series platform, has already embraced AI. Last year, it released a tool it calls CoPilot, which was trained on thousands of hours of content to understand the “beats” of a formulaic story, helping writers add cliffhangers or plot twists to their stories that it predicts will make audiences want to watch more. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian company Holywater, which raised $22 million to fund its microdrama app My Drama, calls itself an “AI-first entertainment network.”

While microdrama could fully go the way of AI, Dhar Mann Studios CEO Sean Atkins thinks there’s also an opportunity for creators.

“Think about it — short-form is a little less overhead than long-form, and vertical is even less overhead,” Atkins told TechCrunch. “I think you’ll see a handful of creators start going into that pretty significantly, particularly since they have the experience of low-cost production.”

In this episode of Galaxy Brain, host Charlie Warzel speaks with the reporter Ryan Broderick about how the internet’s fragmentation of attention and facts has bled into real-world political violence in Minneapolis this month. From the viral spread of a right-wing video about day-care fraud in Minnesota to the aggressive ICE activity in the region that followed, the episode charts how online content routinely shapes government action and public perception.

Broderick, who spent days in Minneapolis after the shooting of Renee Nicole Good, describes what he saw on the ground: how protesters and law enforcement are behaving differently this time around, especially with regard to filming and digital organizing. The conversation explores a novel and concerning feedback loop where what happens online spurs real-world interventions, which then generate more content for audiences elsewhere, compounding division and uncertainty about what’s true.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Charlie Warzel: Going back to Renee Good, the idea that there was an ICE agent that was filming while involved in this life-or-death—you know, supposedly for him—situation, right? You’re claiming that, but at the same time you’re using your phone to document this.

Ryan Broderick: Yeah, I’ve never had a law-enforcement agent pull up their assumedly personal smartphone and film me. I’ve never seen that—to have them just, like, have a gun in one hand and a phone in the other blew my mind. And I just have to wonder, Where is that content going? Where are those photos and videos going?

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel. Welcome to Galaxy Brain. Around 2015, I started to do a lot of reporting on the ways that the internet was causing a societal rupture. It’s possible, I think, that for Americans—and maybe for everybody—that there’s never been a true shared reality. That we have always been living, in some respect, in filter bubbles of our own making, even before the internet.

But as the world really came online, and as our politics and our culture were uploaded to these social networks that are essentially built for viral advertising, the shreds of our monoculture were consumed by a constellation of content, much of it algorithmically fed to us, and that something changed in that moment. I wrote back in 2017 that it felt like that was the first year—in the first year of the [Donald] Trump presidency—where it just became obvious that Americans were effectively living in two universes, and each one was propped up by their own information ecosystems.

Around that time, too, I was also writing a lot about the ways that technology would continue to blur and make it harder to understand what was real and what wasn’t real. In 2018, I wrote this piece where I spoke to a number of researchers, including a man named Aviv Ovadya. And he specifically warned of this infocalypse, is what he called it—an information apocalypse—basically a future where AI tools and craven hyperpartisan actors on this algorithmic internet that’s completely fragmented and fractured and tech-powered would allow anyone to cast aspersions on any event or anything or any fact. People could just fake anything. And they argued that would eventually create this realm where, to borrow a phrase from the researcher Peter Pomerantsev, nothing is true, and everything is possible.

People, they said, would be radicalized. They’d be overwhelmed. They’d be hopelessly divided, and they’d be sad. But mostly it would get to the state where when you can’t figure out what’s true—when everything is just this information war—that eventually you just start to tune out. And this was all pre-pandemic. It felt very plausible, but the generative AI tools weren’t out yet. They were pretty crude. They were pretty bad.

So there was this feeling that it was plausible, but it still felt so futuristic.

But today, it kind of feels like we’re living in that future. Just in January, just this month, it feels to me—as someone who’s covered this for a long time—that we are living in a pretty straightforward depiction of what the worst-case, post-truth, information-apocalypse scenario was, of the people who were warning about it in the late 2010s. I mean, if you just think about this month, you have X and Grok and this major platform generating and distributing this AI nonconsensual sexual-abuse material. And having it viralized and weaponized to intimidate and harass minors and women. You have a terminally online government. And you have the officials marshaling the resources of the military in service of propaganda to perform for this imagined audience online. And that’s all happened with the U.S.’s military invasion and capture of [Nicolás] Maduro and all the content that has been posted alongside it. You have a YouTuber named Nick Shirley, who at the end of last year posted this video online alleging daycare fraud in Minnesota involving the state’s Somali population. That video exploded online and eventually led to a chain of events that led to the Trump administration deploying a higher level of enforcement of ICE en masse to the Twin Cities. This, of course, culminated in an increased amount of raids and ICE agents in the street in Minneapolis. And, ultimately, in an ICE agent shooting and killing Renee Good in her car. It was captured on video. That video quickly spread online, with people analyzing it from multiple angles There have been tons of protests in the ensuing weeks. So much of that has been captured online. Protesters filming ICE; ICE agents filming protesters. Incredible amounts of content on social networks of people being abducted or arrested or having tear gas deployed on them.

It is this situation where it feels like there’s this battle being fought through everyone’s phone. It feels a bit like a hinge point, and it feels like there is a—despite all of the political issues happening here—that there is a technological issue, that this is all a bit of a culmination of things that I’ve been following for a really long time. Somebody else who’s been following that in some cases alongside me is Ryan Broderick. Ryan Broderick writes the Garbage Day newsletter and is the host of the Panic World podcast. Ryan and I worked together at BuzzFeed during the 2010s for quite a while, covering the ways that the internet changes how we behave politically, and the way that it can impact some of these political movements. Ryan was someone whom BuzzFeed sent to cover all kinds of online and offline protests around the world. He’s been to 22 countries, reported from six continents. And he’s been on the ground for close to a dozen referendums and elections. Ryan recently came back from observing all the protesting in Minneapolis, and he joins me today to talk about what happened in Minnesota, what is happening, and the ways in which all of this can be linked and not linked to an extremely online society. He joins me now.

All right, Ryan Broderick, welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Ryan Broderick: Thank you for having me. I’m so excited. Congrats on becoming a podcaster. I’m really sorry that happened to you.

Warzel: I know. It’s everything I ever wanted—to just be mocked on YouTube and across multiplatforms. It’s lovely.

Broderick: That’s right. It’s about discovering new audiences that hate you. That’s what modern life is.

Warzel: That’s what we’re doing. Man. Well, I appreciate it. I want to talk to you about your reporting. You went to Minneapolis just a few days after an ICE agent killed Renee Good, and you were there for protests around the city and around the federal building. I want to start with—just tell me what it was like to be on the ground in Minneapolis for those few days.

Broderick: It’s very surreal. I’ve definitely come back with a profoundly different take on the seriousness, I would say, of the Trump administration. I think you and I have been having essentially one conversation for a decade. Which is like: How seriously should we be taking this stuff? Is this just like internet chatter, or is this a real existential threat to American democracy? And now that I’ve kind of seen the whole hyper object—you know, from internet content down to what is effectively an occupation of an American city—I think we need to take it very seriously. I’m pretty freaked out.

Warzel: Yeah. So give me a sense of, because you were kind of there in the beginning of this. I mean, things are still going on. There’s still people protesting. This is not a finished movement in terms of the raids in the Twin Cities. But since you were there in the beginning, tell me how you saw it evolve, in terms of both the protesters and ICE’s participation there.

Broderick: Yeah. So, we saw the news come across social that Renee Nicole Good had been killed in Minneapolis. And my producer, Grant, and I—we work on our show Panic World together—so we started talking to our partners on our podcast, which is Courier News. And I was like: “Look, I think this is big. We should do this.” And so we went. Basically, we were there 24 hours after she was killed, and we spent the weekend there. And, you know, if we had had the money and the resources, I’d still be there.

I think it is still unfolding and developing. But the point of our trip was not to—I keep stressing this in everywhere I talk about this—like, our point was not to re-report what people in Minnesota are already covering. They have a great local news scene. But there are specific questions that I think people like you and I ask of events like this, that local news doesn’t have the bandwidth or even the interest in asking, or know. And so it was really useful for me to just follow the action for four or five days and see how this community is using technology, how they’re responding to technology, how the internet is shaping the events on the ground. And I think we did that, but yeah, I think this is going to become just sort of like one of those long political quagmires that happens during Trump administration. Like, it’s just going to drag out.

Warzel: So give me a sense of the level of online-ness of these protests. Give me a sense of how the tech is shaping it. I think for the first, part of the question is: A lot of modern protest movements are very online organized, via social networks and different apps and things like that. This one seems to be, based off of the reporting I saw a little bit. You read that a little bit differently.

Broderick: Yeah. I mean, so—I was trying to think back of what was the last protest that I went to. And I went to a few during 2020. But the last sort of movement like this that I saw close was the Hong Kong democracy movement in 2019. And I was there for what would eventually be—I think no one knew at the time—but it was the last time they protested before China really cracked down. And that was totally online. Like, I watched a completely silent crowd moving in perfect sort of organization using Telegram. Which I was really like, freaky. lLike these Gen Z kids had figured out how to use these messaging apps in a way that I’d never seen before. Minnesota is not like There’s a hashtag, and we’re all spray-painting it around the city, and we’re wearing Guy Fawkes masks and shit. No, none of that. It is people who are, if they’re using apps, they’re using Signal. They’re using a walkie-talkie app; I think there’s a couple that they’re using to organize ICE monitoring. And they’re finding out about protests and demonstrations by just going to them. Like, we interviewed countless people who are like, I was on my way back from work, and I saw this, and I’m mad. So I came by. And we talked to people who’ve never been to a protest before in their lives. Like, you know, we’re talking like middle-aged people who are like, I don’t have any real political thoughts, and this is insane. And I’m going to come out, and I’m going to protest. So it was very different. And to compare that to the other side, which is extremely online, was a total inversion of everything I’ve seen in my career. Like, it really stopped me in my tracks.

Warzel: Let’s talk a little about that. Because something striking that I saw in your reporting, just like coming across on social media as you were like sharing in the moment, was—

Warzel: Well, I always read the posts, but in the moment.

Broderick: No, you just read the Bluesky post. See, I know. I get it. Yeah.

Warzel: I mean, you think I’m gonna pay for a subscription? I mean, come on.

Broderick: No, I wouldn’t. Yeah. Of course.

Warzel: Something that I saw, though, was you were videoing a couple of what seemed to be content creators, like stepping out of ICE vehicles. Or at least government or unmarked government-looking vehicles. Filming, and then like popping back and not addressing themselves. What did you see in terms of creators, influencers who were sort of either deployed by or administration adjacent? Or supported by the administration, you know, in some facets?

Broderick: So the specific incident you’re talking about, with the guy who jumps out of the ICE vehicle. Basically, this woman gets arrested by ICE because she punches their window as they drive by. Like, didn’t damage the window or whatever, if anyone cares. But they jump out of the cars, they pull up, and they just tackle her to the ground. And then right behind them—coming out of the same car—was a guy in plainclothes, like a nice suit. you know, like sunglasses. And he’s smiling, and he’s filming the whole thing.

And I am screaming at him, like, Who are you? Why aren’t you in uniform? Who are you with? Where’s that video going? I later find out that it’s a Fox News correspondent that was on a ride along with ICE. But there was also just like a ton of other right-wing networks that are around. Like, the Daily Wire was filming people. And OAN and NewsNation and all the baddies. There were also a group of YouTubers, livestreamers, content creators that were running around the city, harassing people. And they had a much less official connection to ICE. But obviously whenever they would rile up the crowd, the ICE agents would come out and protect them from the crowd.

And that culminated in last weekend with the leader of that group: Jake Lang, a January 6 insurrectionist. He tried to burn a Quran on the steps of the Minneapolis City Hall. And got his ass beat. And so it’s—that, to me, is much more connected to what we’ve already seen in Trump administrations. Like, the roving gangs of content creators that are just, you know, trying to antagonize leftists and make them look violent on stream. But the fact that ICE was so brutal to the protesters while also basically running defense for these content creators … they weren’t trying to hide it, in the way that you know, police forces were in the 2020 protests.

Warzel: Well, let’s talk a little bit about what you saw from ICE agents. Because there is this element, and I want to get into it in a second, of this content-creation spectacle. But in terms of you saying you came back from this, and it’s very obviously understandable why you would feel this way. Like, I’m freaked out about this. And the seriousness of what’s happening there and what the administration’s doing. But can you just describe for me—and for people, you know, who may not be mainlining this stuff on their phones—what you were seeing from ICE that was so disturbing, or the way that they were treating protesters.

Broderick: They don’t even seem to understand why they’re trying to control the crowd. They don’t, really. I’ve dealt with, you know, antagonistic police forces in protests before. And there’s a rhythm to it. There’s sort of like an assumption that like, If you do this, they won’t really hassle you. And, you know, we can get into the weeds of like how that breaks down as protests become more extreme.

But, like, there’s protocols. ICE does not have that. They don’t really care. They will scream at you. They’ll yell at you. They’ll kind of break kayfabe. They are also filming you. They are, like, very intent on filming you with their cell phones. And with telescopic lenses, that they have guys parked behind them in cars, filming through the window.

Warzel: And that feels very different, right?

Broderick: I’ve never seen that. I’ve never seen that.

Warzel: That’s not something I’ve … even going back to Renee Good, the idea that there was an ICE agent that was filming while involved in this, you know, life-or-death—supposedly for him—situation, right? You’re claiming that, but at the same time you’re using your phone to document this. That feels very unique. That feels like a very different form of, you know, enforcement tactics.

Broderick: Yeah, I’ve never seen it. I’ve never had a law-enforcement agent pull up their assumedly personal smartphone and film me. Like, I’ve never seen that. And I mean, obviously, like there are agencies that do surveillance on protest movements, and it happens. But to have them just, like, have a gun in one hand and a phone in the other blew my mind. And I just have to wonder, Where is that content going? Where are those photos and videos going?

Broderick: Yeah, And so, like the fact that these guys are just taking photos of people and either uploading them to some kind of database or sharing them with each other, like, my mind sort of goes to: Okay, then what? So these guys, let’s say they have dozens of photos and videos of random people in Minneapolis on their phones. Like, are they sending them to each other? Being like, Keep an eye out for this person, and like beat their ass if you see them? I don’t know. We will eventually, at some kind of trial, perhaps find out what these guys are doing on back channel. But yeah. It sort of adds to the idea that these guys are like, I don’t know, content creators first and a Gestapo second. Or something. It’s very surreal, very dystopian.

Warzel: Yeah, and the nonprofessionalization of all of it, right? There is a piece, I believe it was last week, could have been the week before, where a reporter, writing for Slate, applied to work for ICE. Had a military background, but certainly was like somebody who had been hypercritical of the Trump administration and immigration policy, enforcement policies, and ICE in general. And still got hired. The idea of being, like, the threshold is so low. Did it add to the anxiety knowing that you’re dealing with a sort of improvised force? Not only that the guys are out there filming—it seems like they wanna be creating some content—but also just this idea that, again, the standards of training might be totally different. Did that add to the sense of unease, in terms of the protesters and the people who are around?

Broderick: Yeah. I mean, you can’t really predict what they’re going to do. I remember on the Saturday we were there, there’s this massive protest in Minneapolis. Thousands, 5,000 people. Many of them immigrants. Like, many of them with immigrant-rights groups and stuff. And, you know, we’re going through these little side streets in Minneapolis. And I just kept thinking, like, What is stopping Trump from saying on Truth Social, “Hey, get them”?

And Greg Bovino and everybody, like, cordoning off two sides of the street and just kettling everybody? You know, that can happen. Like, the sort of general unease of the whole thing is that you’re not dealing with an accountable, a rational, an identifiable law-enforcement group. You’re dealing with guys in masks that are filming you that don’t really have any kind of protocol. And don’t really seem to care about anything other than quotas.

I read that they’re supposed to be getting, like, 3,000 arrests a day. And the other thing is like: When they do detain you, in a normal situation, a reporter gets apprehended at a protest. You might get thrown in jail for like a few hours; maybe the weekend. You might miss filing your story. And then, you go home. With the ICE detention facilities … like, they might just put you somewhere.

And so, if you’re a reporter, and you’re trying to cover this, they’ve already made filming their activities a possible crime. According to what is NPSM-7. If you film their activity—

Broderick: —they can charge you with terrorism. They can charge you with obstruction.

And there’s really no oversight for what they’re doing. So the risks are just a lot higher than any sort of protest movement I’ve ever seen. Yeah.

Warzel: And I believe, what is it? It’s an NSPM-7, right? National Security Presidential Memorandum 7.

Warzel: Is basically an executive order that is meant to dismantle left-wing terrorism and basically allowing the government to qualify people as “domestic terrorists” or “domestic terrorist organizations,” which allows for different standard of prosecution. And yeah, so that’s adding to all that confusion and chaos. So you saw this. You wrote, “We are all content for ICE.” It’s very clear that the Department of Homeland Security has basically transformed immigration arrests into this visual propaganda online. It’s very clear that there is a strategy here. There is a lot of pressure from the administration to have ICE really active in terms of a media campaign. What purpose do you think it is serving them to do that?

Broderick: I think everyone is trying to answer this question. And this might be an unfulfilling answer, but I think there’s a couple things happening simultaneously. I think, one, I think the Trump administration is full of genuinely xenophobic ideologues that want blood-and-soil nationalism. And they love this stuff. I think that Trump is a creature of the media, and he sort of understands that everything has to have a media component to it. And we’ve seen that … like, I don’t think that he’s playing four-dimensional chess. But I think he understands that everything he does has to have some kind of news cycle attached to feel like it matters for him.

Warzel: Well, I’ll just say: On January 20, which is Tuesday of this week, Donald Trump posts on Truth Social, like, We need more photos of people who we’re arresting in Minneapolis. We need more documentation of just how bad they are. Like it’s very clear that while he’s not playing four-dimensional chess that we know of, he is, as you said, just hyper-aware—

Warzel: —of the idea that this needs to be fed. People need to have this raw meat of “Our nation is under siege” in order to continue to support and to justify this.

Broderick: And I think the last part of this is: I think it is safe to assume that the Trump administration is inside of their own filter bubble. I think this is happening across culture en mass. And I think, based on the reports we have seen coming out of sort of the inner circle—you know, if you want to believe them—they were surprised that people were pissed about this. And I don’t think Trump is actually particularly online. I’ve never thought that. I’m like, I don’t think he knows what 4chan is—but I do think that he has surrounded himself with podcasters and posters. And I think that those people are super tapped into X.

And so, we haven’t actually talked about this dimension of what’s happening in Minneapolis yet, but I think it’s important context. So ICE has been in the state for months. All of this ratchets up after the YouTube documentary by the right-wing influencer Nick Shirley. Nick Shirley’s documentary alleges fraud at day cares in Minnesota. All of it had been reported before. It was even being investigated by the FBI already. Like, we’ve known about this. But the right-wingers who had never heard of this—because they don’t read real newspapers, and don’t have accurate information pipelines—were incensed.

So that, to me, points in the direction of: These people genuinely do not know things. And you can say it’s by design. You can say it’s because they’re all stupid. You can say it’s because they’re addicted to the internet. Could be a combination of the three. But that does inform their behavior. And we’ve seen this all year, all of last year. That they are—the administration is doing things because they see them online.

Warzel: Right. And also, think, too: There’s the other side of this. And you wrote about this. I can’t believe this was also in January, when the United States invaded Venezuela. But, you know, the idea of a content-first administration. But something you wrote—I’m going to quote you to yourself here. Which is always fun, I know. You said, “Politics—and political violence—is now something performed, first and foremost, for an online audience. It almost doesn’t matter what happens IRL if it makes noise online.”

And I think that, you know, that it’s not just what you’re saying—which is that there is this filter bubble. There’s this idea that this is acceptable, right? Like, ltheir whatever, Overton window or whatever you want to call it. Like: This is fine. We can do this. People won’t be mad if we act in this particular way. But there’s also the idea of that imagined audience, that maybe someone sees on X or some other place or whatever. But it’s this idea of almost one-upsmanship. It’s like, you do this video of what’s happening in Minneapolis, supposedly with day cares and Somalian refugees. And we’re going to basically perform fan service by sending a paramilitary force into that town. It seems like that level of the performance is really, really important here.

Broderick: Yeah. So once again—for people who are not like mainlining this stuff all day—and they’re sort of thinking like, okay, Trump too. It’s a little more in your face. It’s got like a fresh new attitude, but it’s like—basically it’s the same idea. And there’s, like, a core loop has changed. Trump: One, he wakes up in the morning; he watches Fox & Friends. He performs the day. He then finds out the next morning how Fox & Friends has, like, digested what he’s done. And he just keeps going. Right. So everything’s kind of performed for this TV channel that is then sort of synthesizing what he’s doing and then influencing what he’s doing.

So the difference, though, between that loop and this one is that the internet is inherently a two-way street. So it’s not just what was sort of downstream in the first administration—like, the internet lights up because Trump does something, because Trump saw it on TV. And then TV lights up, and then TV—like, the role of TV in that equation kind of organizes things in a way. Was like a rhythm, too; there’s a much more sort of reliable rhythm to it.

This is way more chaotic. Because, like, Nick Shirley: He’s making a video based off of what he’s already seeing on the internet. It then goes back into the internet, which then influences what’s happening in reality. Which then influences what’s happening on the internet.

And I was sort of trying to figure out: Okay, when did this this new loop start in earnest? And I think I have it, which is the playbook. The test drive for all of this was Springfield, Ohio, and the conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs in the park.

That whole thing, though, is a perfect illustration of what is now happening everywhere all at once. And it’s happened, and I’ve even seen examples of it happening in Venezuela, happening in Greenland. Like, it’s this roving, kind of, internet-content machine that just sort of lands where you live and then turns everything that’s happening to you into this completely inexplicable content cycle. That, you know, for people on the ground, makes no sense—because it’s not really meant for them. And it comes with conspiracy theories and viral videos and racist memes and AI imagery and paramilitary violence. Like, it’s all kind of part of the same thing.

Warzel: It’s really interesting to think of it as almost like a storm system, that develops outside and just comes to your town. I have had trouble trying to get a sense of who this is helping; who this is hurting. Right? ’Cause on one hand, you have all of this documented evidence of what is essentially a paramilitary force drawing guns, you know, in public places on people. Deploying tear gas and pepper balls and all kinds of, you know, chemical sprays on citizens. Arresting people on whims, intimidating people, mocking them. And there’s obviously, of course, the video of an ICE agent shooting a woman in broad daylight.

And that all adds up, I think, in the eyes of people watching online or wherever. That is doing something right to people, and how they view the country. Their country. And then at the same time, these protests can also—as we’re noting—give the administration a little bit of what it wants, right? It gives them content in order to depict these cities as war zones.

And do you get a sense of if this is, like, serving ICE’s propaganda needs effectively right now? Or if this is in some ways just information that is radicalizing people? To get them to, you know, wake up to the political reality in the United States. Where do you see that balance? Or like, where that’s coming out at the moment?

Broderick: That’s like the million-dollar question, I think. I mean—

Warzel: Right. That’s all we ask here on Galaxy Brain, is the million-dollar questions.

Broderick: Thank you for asking me the most complicated question of our time. I think there’s a couple of ways to think about it. And they are—this is always my cop-out, but I do think in this case, if American monoculture ever did truly exist, we like to imagine it did, you know, pre-Facebook. But maybe it didn’t. Maybe, like, the TV and movies made it feel like it existed, and we could all sort of believe in that. But let’s assume things are different. I think there are vastly different realities happening simultaneously in America. So there are people who are just not going outside, and they are consuming all of this online. And they are being radicalized either for or against it. And that’s, like, one camp.

And then there are the people that it’s happening to directly. The ones I talked to are just the most average Americans you could possibly imagine. And they’re like, This is insanity. And do I have to, like, go to the federal building and blow whistles every day because these people won’t leave me alone? And I’ve met those people, and they are just like the most normal people you can imagine. And they are incensed. They’re furious.

And then I think that there are a lot of Americans who just really do not believe that this could happen to them. And those realities, like, don’t really line up anymore. Because we’re not all looking at the same feed of information. We’re not all looking at the same screen. And it adds to the chaos. It adds to the unpredictability of all this. Because, you know, there are a lot of, like, non-white immigrant Groypers that sit online all day talking about how they love Nick Fuentes and think the Holocaust didn’t happen. What happens when ICE breaks down one of their doors? Right? Like, there are a lot of these keyboard-warrior types who do not imagine this could ever happen to their town. And if it does happen in their town, it’s going to happen to the people who deserve it in their town. And yet, time and time again, for the last year, we’ve seen stories come out, being like: I didn’t think they’d take the good immigrant in my town, that I liked. You know?

And so there are—I don’t think the average American really is prepared for the severity of what’s happened. Like, of when it happens to them. And it is in, I think, the Trump administration’s best interest to flood the zone with images of this stuff. Because it does make it feel abstract. The average person watches and cares until it no longer looks like it could happen to you. And I think that does serve Trump’s interests. If Minneapolis looks like a completely unrecognizable war zone, that’s great. It just means that the person watching goes, Well, that doesn’t look like my backyard. So I should be fine.

Warzel: Mm-hmm. Right. And I was just really struck in your guys’ reporting for Panic World, which came out in a video-podcast form as well—which, people should go watch that. You know, some of the people you interviewed were like—and this has been documented elsewhere as well—the most Minnesota Nice. You know, like just sort of, Yeah, you know, I just came from my shift at school. Or whatever. It’s like when you see that and you feel that there is this way of just being. Like—I think it brings the sort of, it’s a great contrasted image with the paramilitary force. It’s like, anyone who’s drawing guns on this person? Like, we’ve totally lost the plot. It’s not that it’s justified when it happens to people who don’t, you know, maybe look like you. But just this idea of … it’s a strong visual image for people who are watching at home, is what I mean.

Broderick: I think it’s also a self-perpetuating machine. Because—forget who made this point. Maybe it was Wired. I think it was Wired last week, this week. They’re all blending together. But they were basically like: There’s no reason for the Proud Boys to exist anymore, because ICE exists. And so if you’re running … I mean, Trumpism doesn’t really have an ideological center, but if you had to try to define it, you’d say, Okay, it’s like grievance-based. It’s like the Trump supporters hate other people for various reasons, and we’re gonna make a big tent where all your different grievances kind of live in semi-harmony together. And we can hurt others.

And then if you open up a paramilitary force, that requires what? 4Forty-seven days of training to join, and they’re not even gonna like check if you’re a Slate reporter or not. Like, you can just go and hurt other people. And so, in a sense, almost, it almost makes logical sense that this would be the next step for Trumpism. Because you can’t sustain that, like, othering of Americans long-term, without some way to get people to sign up and do it. So it’s almost like we have to create this paramilitary force, and we have to start paying people to do this. Because if we don’t, that energy could dissipate. Or they might just find out that maybe we’re not also different after all.

Warzel: This was something that I was thinking about in different way. And it is a bit of a tangent. But I’ve—as you have been writing about, you know, MAGA influencers, and stuff like screeching online about “civil war” since like 2017 or whatever, right? Like, people who are just like, This is going to lead to some kind of, you know, massive crack-up type thing. T

Then so many people that I’ve talked to who are actually, you know, experts in this type of stuff and in conflicts are like: “You know, part of the reason why terms like civil war are like so unhelpful is because it’s incredibly difficult to imagine in certain places, especially a country as big as the United States, giving structure to a conflict like that.” This idea that’s like, so much of it would just be, you know, weird infighting. Or, you know, acts of almost seemingly random terrorism or whatnot. Right? And the thing that I have found so interesting and scary about the way that the Trump administration is not only using ICE, but the way that they are marketing it, right? This idea of all of this propaganda that’s very clearly aimed at white nationalists. “Defend the homeland” type of stuff.

The reason why I find that so bracing in the moment is that it feels like—and this is sort of, I think, what you’re saying—that it’s giving structure to a conflict, right? It is just sort of like a repository for, if you feel this way, like, about your country being under attack or invasion. Or you’ve been radicalized by some of these platforms to the point where, you know, posting just isn’t doing it for you anymore? Here’s a place to go, right? Sign up. And it becomes less of like—you can see, you know, in a sort of speculative way, this becoming a repository for a very specific type of person. And a force that actually does resemble what some of these militia-like organizations were, right? Except in this case, it has government funding. And, you know, according to both J. D. Vance and Stephen Miller, absolute immunity for your actions. And that feels like it is a completely different, or like a turn of the screw on this concern about infighting in this country.

Broderick: Yeah, no—I think that’s exactly right. If we take the reports at face value that morale is very bad inside of ICE, I do wonder how they deal with that. You know, like you, I’m always sort of saying, like, What’s next? Is this working? Is this not working? And if we say that, okay, those reports are correct. Like ICE agents are miserable. They join ICE. They’re all revved up on white-nationalist Facebook content. And then they hit the streets, and everyone’s like, “Get the fuck out of my city.” Like, “I hate you.”

I mean, I heard the heckling in Minneapolis. And they found out a bunch of their names, and they just kept chanting, So-and-so, quit your job; so-and-so, quit your job. And these people are becoming pariahs. So that, to me, is like, your filter bubble has lied to you. You’ve joined this federal agency for student-loan forgiveness or whatever it is. And now you’re in the middle of Minnesota in the middle of January, and everyone’s screaming that they hate you and spitting at you and stuff. You might quit. And that’s, like, a hopeful version.

And then there’s the scarier version. Which is like: What does the Trump administration do with that? Because we are dealing with like lots and lots of people who are getting revved up on stuff they’re seeing online, who maybe would have joined a militia and LARPed Confederate soldiers in the backyard for the next five years. But now they’re out with guns, and they’re like trying to struggle with the cognitive dissonance of The world online and the world in real life are not the same. You know, what does that do to a paramilitary force like ICE? Like, what is the next step? And I assume you’re right. Which is like: They just start dehumanizing us further and further with internet content.

Warzel: Yeah, I mean, as you’re giving the hopeful version, I’m like: Well, this just absolutely totally rhymes with everything that we have covered over the last, you know, whatever decade on the internet. Where it’s like: Yeah, there is this version in which everyone’s like, Okay, that was a fever dream. Like, whoa, like the cognitive dissonance hits, and you say, Okay, yeah, man, I was just totally wrong. Like, this is awful. This is a terrible way to live. Or what tends to happen online—and again, doesn’t always happen in the real world because there is more friction there—is this idea of doubling down, right? Well, why declare being wrong, when I could just simply make up a reality? Or make up something? Right. Exactly.

I want to ask you to try to put some of this into some context. And I’m going to do the wonderful thing where I quote you again. But I went back, and I read a story. We both used to work at BuzzFeed News. You wrote this back in late 2018. I think it was after [Jair] Bolsonaro won in Brazil. And I believe that you were there on the ground. I’m going to read this, which is you said, quote: “I’ve followed that dark revolution of internet culture ever since. I’ve had the privilege—or deeply strange curse—to chase the growth of global political warfare around the world. In the last four years, I’ve been to 22 countries, six continents, and been on the ground for close to a dozen referendums and elections. I was in London for the U.K.’s nervous breakdown over Brexit, in Barcelona for Catalonia’s failed attempts at a secession from Spain, in Sweden as neo-Nazis tried to march on the country’s largest book fair. And now, I’m in Brazil. But this era of being surprised at what the internet can and will do to us is ending. The damage is done. I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that I’ll probably spend the rest of my career covering the consequences.”

I have a few questions here. And the first is: Do you still feel like you can draw a straight line between all this? That was there, and all that has come after—from COVID to George Floyd to January 6 to Trump 2 to Minneapolis now. Like, did you feel like there’s a straight line here? Did it break off and shift in different directions?

Broderick: With the benefit of hindsight, I think the attitude in 2018 to say this is all because of internet platforms is a little simplistic. I think it’s a little ahistorical.

Looking at the whole picture—or at least the picture up to now—it seems clear that the sort of post–Cold War geopolitical order, this kind of neoliberal end-of-history idea, was deeply alienating and frustrating for people. The concept that we are all kind of done, and we’re just going to get incrementally better in progressive ways. Maybe we’ll have, like, a Republican come in and kind of calm things down, and then we’ll go back and forth. And that idea was extremely frustrating to people. And when social media appeared, it allowed people to communicate without arbiters for the first time.

So you start to see things like the Ron Paul presidential campaign in 2008, which I’ve gone back to several times because things are such a fascinating sort of prototype of everything since. Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring, the very first Black Lives Matter stuff. And what I think you and I, and other people doing this work, we’re not really totally getting—because of the nature of the way we cover it. Which is not a problem. It’s just that no one can see the whole picture.

Is that like—the technology didn’t really create pathways that weren’t there. What it did was allow us to see them. And so, it’s why I said earlier in the episode that we don’t know if monoculture was as monolithic as we assume it was pre-internet. Could just be that we didn’t know. And so I think there is a straight line from, let’s say, the launch of message boards in the ’90s to now, and Facebook, and everything else along the way.

But it’s not like Facebook conjured up some kind of political environment that wasn’t there. It’s that it gave people like [Rodrigo] Duterte, like [Narendra] Modi, like Bolsonaro, like Trump, like Marine Le Pen—gotta catch them all. All these people, it gave them the ability to speak to an audience that was already alienated and already angry and already bored. And that dovetailed perfectly with the way internet technology has developed in that same timeframe.

So, you know, now we’re at a point where they are essentially the same thing. What is good for the internet is good for your populist far-right movement. And yeah, I think that will sound right. Five more years from now? I think, yeah, I don’t know.

Warzel: Ryan, I thank you for your reporting on this, for being in the pain, the emotional pain cave, the internet brain-damage Thunderdome with me for all these years. And thanks. Thanks for all your insights on this.

Broderick: Hey, I’ll see you in the gulag.

In a recent Atlantic article about Adam Morgan’s new book, A Danger to the Minds of Young Girls, Sophia Stewart poses a choice that many biographers struggle with: “what to do with the boring bits.” This feels like an apt dilemma to invoke while critiquing a book about an editor. Morgan’s subject, Margaret Anderson, was the first person to publish portions of James Joyce’s Ulysses in the United States—and was convicted on obscenity charges as a result. But as Stewart writes, Anderson, who founded The Little Review in 1914, was an editor for less than 10 years, and afterward she lived “the way most people do, somewhat aimlessly.” Because of this, Stewart believes, the biography falls short of its promise; Morgan fails to prove his argument that Anderson’s “greatest work” was “the life she had forged” after leaving her career. Perhaps, she suggests, he should have focused on the editing—and edited out the boring bits.

First, here are four stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Morgan’s book is the latest in a series of recent biographies that set out, as Stewart writes, to anoint editors including Malcolm Cowley, Judith Jones, and Bennett Cerf “as the unsung architects of the American literary canon.” The editor-biography I would most recommend is far older than the new crop, and it shows the benefits of a tight focus on the work—rather than the life—of its brilliant subject.

A. Scott Berg begins his 1978 biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, by describing what Perkins, a legendary editor at Scribner, did for his authors: “He helped them structure their books, if help was needed; thought up titles, invented plots; he served as psychoanalyst, lovelorn advisor, marriage counselor, career manager, money-lender. Few editors before him had done so much work on manuscripts, yet he was always faithful to his credo, ‘The Book belongs to the author.’” Following through on this opening, Berg illustrates in minute detail the way Perkins managed to act in all these capacities, turning piles of paper into great American novels such as The Great Gatsby and A Farewell to Arms.

“Are biographers storytellers or annalists?” Stewart asks in her piece. “The best of them combine the two vocations.” Berg certainly does; his manner of focusing wasn’t to pare away information, but instead to dig deep into the archives. Because his subject was surrounded by colorful and often unpredictable characters—alcoholics, neurotics, and blowhards—Perkins’s self-effacing qualities make for a dramatic contrast and a wealth of wild stories. And because Perkins’s work was painstaking, Berg’s research was exhaustive. It took many interviews and manuscript analyses to emerge with a narrative that proves that Perkins didn’t only edit geniuses, but was one. And it’s rarely boring to watch a genius at work.

Berg did one more thing right. The first important choice a biographer must make is the same one an editor confronts: Pick the most promising project. This sometimes means an exciting or popular figure, but it can also mean an enigmatic character whose accomplishments (and associates) compel intense curiosity. Max Perkins, Berg’s first book, won a National Book Award. He went on to write biographies of Charles Lindbergh, Katharine Hepburn, and Woodrow Wilson; all these works were acclaimed, but none was as surprising as his debut.

A Champion of Modernism, in Literature and Life

Margaret C. Anderson was at the center of a notorious literary-obscenity trial. Then she was forgotten.

Some events unfold so quickly, and overturn the status quo so completely, that they seem preordained. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 transformed the country almost overnight into a fundamentalist theocracy. But as Anderson, a war correspondent who has covered conflicts in the Middle East and beyond, shows in this thrilling account, nothing about the final months of the reign of the shah appears settled or inevitable. Drawing on government communiqués and first-person accounts—including that of a cantankerous American diplomat who seems to have witnessed every pivotal moment—Anderson describes a failure that had many fathers: not just the imperious yet indecisive Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, or the ruthless Ayatollah Khomeini, but also the useful idiots who surrounded the cleric, along with President Jimmy Carter’s fractious and communism-obsessed foreign-policy team. A catastrophe that reshaped the world, Anderson suggests, was enabled by people who couldn’t imagine how the world might change.

📚 Beckomberga, by Sara Stridsberg; translated by Deborah Bragan-Turner

“The object of the museum is to acquire power,” announces a crusty old archaeologist in Penelope Fitzgerald’s 1977 satire, The Golden Child. It isn’t a goal he respects. He wants the museum where he’s settled into semiretirement to genuinely devote itself to educating its visitors. Instead, he correctly charges, its curators act like a pack of Gollums, hoarding “the art and treasures of the earth” for their own self-aggrandizement and pleasure.

            <h2>The Sports Conspiracy That’s Too Easy to Believe</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/49ers-emf-conspiracy-theory/685722/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The San Francisco 49ers will not be playing in the Super Bowl, because they lost to the Seattle Seahawks by a disgraceful score of 41 to 6 over the weekend. But of course, “someone wins, someone loses” is never the whole story in sports.

Some fans are now buying into the narrative that the team had no chance because it suffered a suspicious number of devastating injuries over the course of the season (as well as in recent past seasons). Any fan could rattle off a list—quarterback Brock Purdy has dealt with several injuries (coming off a torn UCL a couple of years ago), three key players tore their ACLs this season, and one also tore his MCL. While the team was getting demolished by the Seahawks, tight end Jake Tonges went down with a plantar-fascia injury. To explain this, some fans pointed to the fact that the team’s practice field and stadium are near an electrical substation and suggested that the electromagnetic waves emanating from it could be weakening players’ bodies, making them especially susceptible to soft-tissue injuries such as tendon tears and muscle strains.

“The 49ers absolutely should spend whatever it takes ($20 million?) to move the electrical substation away from their practice facility,” one viral post suggested during the game. Reporters are now asking team leadership about the issue; on Wednesday afternoon, the team’s general manager, John Lynch, said in a press conference that he’s actively looking into the situation. “We’ve been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see Does a study exist?” he said.

To be clear, the concerns are baseless. The United States has thousands of electrical substations; people live near them, and other sports teams practice next to them, too. Some scientists say that you can never totally rule out the possibility that this type of ambient electromagnetic exposure might cause harm, but they have also looked for decades without producing any convincing evidence of such harm. Geoffrey Kabat, an epidemiologist and the author of 2008’s Hyping Health Risks: Environmental Hazards in Daily Life and the Science of Epidemiology, was part of a group of scientists looking for a possible association between electromagnetic-field exposure and breast cancer in the 1990s. They didn’t find any. “We’re dealing with a very weak form of energy,” he told me. There is just no proven way for these weak fields to disrupt human cells, so long as their frequencies stay below the threshold that causes tissue heating (as happens in a microwave).

But fans believe what they believe. They are obligated to live in a state of unceasing anxiety, superstition, and fear of their team being cursed. The power-plant theory is an iteration of that tradition—a movement away from mystical explanations such as the Curse of the Billy Goat and toward shareable deep dives, investigations, and dot-connecting. With all the tools available to them in the digital age (reams of hard data, unlimited multimedia “evidence”), fans can explain their teams’ worst turns of bad luck by composing what can only be called conspiracy theories. Today’s fans will go down YouTube rabbit holes; conduct amateur, open-source investigations; and cut numbers this way and that until they reveal a startling pattern.

This particular theory is emerging during a time when alternative theories of science and medicine are central to American culture—Donald Trump’s EPA has indulged internet-y concern about chemtrails, and we’re back to bickering about conventional wisdom on some of the most basic questions of health and safety, including whether milk ought to be pasteurized. Why not take another look at electricity too, while we’re at it?

The substation theory seems to have been percolating for a while, but it blew up on social media in early January after a holistic-health influencer named Peter Cowan posted a lengthy, scientific-sounding explanation of how “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage at levels regulators call ‘safe.’” He referred to the 49ers as a “real world case study,” and a faction of 49ers fans latched on. Chase Senior, a popular online commentator within 49ers fandom, shared parts of Cowan’s theory on X (leaving out some of its odder digressions, such as one about the Cold War), and contributed significantly to its spread.

“When it gets to the point where the team is so injured every single season, I think that it is fair to look into anything and everything to try to determine why they’ve been so hurt,” Senior told me. Initially, most people were hostile to the idea. They called him, he said, an “idiot.” Some people still call him that, and theorize that the injuries likely have something to do with the style of the team’s play or its approach to strength and conditioning or stretching and recovery. Many also pointed out that the 49ers are fairly old, as a team, and that they played on short rest a few times this season.

Indeed, the most obvious explanation for the 49ers’ problem is that football is a violent sport. The NFL has an injury epidemic, Matt Maiocco, a 49ers beat reporter for NBC Sports Bay Area, reminded me when I called to ask about the substation theory. “There’s three kinds of football players,” he said. “Guys who have been injured, guys who are already injured, and guys who will be injured.” The team has practiced in the same spot in Santa Clara for decades, he pointed out, and the substation has been there for much of that time. I asked him whether the 49ers really have had particularly bad luck with injuries the past few years. “It feels that way,” he said. “And I think the closer you are to something, the more it feels that way.” (Sports bloggers who crunch the numbers find that they are among the more injured teams—but to reiterate, all football teams are very injured.)

None of these explanations is very compelling to Senior, who has continued bringing the conspiracy theory up online, with increasing defensiveness. He says he noticed a shift during the postseason. “The Niners continued to get hurt,” he said. During the first round of the playoffs, on January 11, the 49ers beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. But tight end George Kittle, one of their best players, went down early in the game with a torn Achilles tendon—the type of devastating injury that happens out of nowhere. With that, more fans and commentators grew intrigued, and others started to couch their disapproval of the theory. Even if odds are low that there’s anything to it, is it so hard for someone to check it out?

Some current and former football players have started talking about the substation theory and giving it credibility. The 49ers wide receiver Kendrick Bourne joked about the situation himself after the game against the Eagles. A reporter asked why his team was suffering so many injuries. “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” he said. “Nah, I’m just playing, I don’t know.” He went on with a more typical professional-athlete answer along the lines of how injuries are really unfortunate, but you have to have a next-man-up mentality and keep going, etc.

Now that a pattern has been proposed, it will become only more visible. Each time a 49er is injured, the power plant will come up again (mirroring the endless repeatability of the #DiedSuddenly anti-vaccine conspiracy theory, which was, for a time, invoked whenever someone died unexpectedly). But it also isn’t that serious. The reporter who asked Lynch about the substation seemed embarrassed to be talking about it, and most reasonable people clearly understand that the idea is far-fetched. Some fans are having fun with it and indulging in a little gallows humor to help them get over a disappointing end to their season.

The electromagnetic waves aren’t powerful enough to hurt an NFL player—the real question is whether the story about them is powerful enough to become a durable piece of 49ers lore. When I asked a friend of mine who grew up as a 49ers fan about the substation, she waved it off and proposed an alternative theory for the heartbreaking losses and horrifically timed injuries of the past 10 years. She said that she didn’t know anything about EMFs, but that this was something all true fans believe: The 49ers should never have left Candlestick Park, their beloved old home in San Francisco, where they reigned in their glory days, to go to Levi’s Stadium, their bland, uninspiring new one in Santa Clara, where they have seen nothing but suffering. When they did that, they offended the universe, the Earth, or God. That was serious.</div>

            <h2>The Dangers That Scientists Found Inside L.A.'s Smoky Homes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/urban-fire-health/685723/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After just a year, the fires that spread around Los Angeles are already the most studied urban wildfires in history. While the Palisades Fire lapped at the edge of UCLA, the Eaton Fire, on the east side of town, came dangerously close to Caltech. Even as the fires were spreading, these research powerhouses, as well as the University of Southern California, deployed sensors, scientists, and new hypotheses. Researchers around the city began collecting water, soil, and air samples; physicians started to recruit participants into long-term health studies.

Even as the researchers absorbed the reality of the damage across an area that included 20 million residents, they understood that this was a chance, one that might never exist again, to better understand the nature of these types of disasters. These particular fires offered researchers opportunities to collect samples in ways they hadn’t before been able to—“so close to the fire and so timely,” Yifang Zhu, an environmental scientist at UCLA, told me.

Some of these efforts will take years to become fully fleshed out. The Los Angeles Fire Human Exposure and Long-Term Health Study, for instance, is a multi-institution, 10-year effort to better understand the short- and long-term health impacts of the fires. A year after the fires, though, researchers have some early answers to what happens to mental and physical health after wildfires move from trees and shrubs to homes and buildings.

Not all fires are the same, and although these fires started in the hills with scrub brush, they ended up in urban areas, flaming through more than 18,000 structures. “It’s a new type of fire, because it’s an urban conflagration,” David Eisenman, a researcher at UCLA who has spent the past 25 years studying the impact of disasters on mental and physical health, told me. These fires may start in areas where wildland and urban settlements edge up against one another, but as they spread, they “mostly consume, by volume, man‑made products in megacities—that’s a real difference.” Researchers have long studied what goes into the air when trees burn in a fire, but when the fuel is homes, cars, and businesses—the stuff of people’s lives—what ends up in the air is largely unknown. The many chemicals, including asbestos and lead, in our homes can form a toxic soup. The combustion process can also create new hazards; scientists were surprised to find airborne nanoparticles of hexavalent chromium, the contaminant made famous by the movie Erin Brockovich, hanging around cleanup sites.

One surprise lesson was that the fire risk didn’t end once the smoke had dissipated. Levels of benzene spiked, then came down after about a week. But even after the outdoor air began to clear, measures of hazardous chemicals in indoor air showed signals from fire-related compounds that had infiltrated people’s homes and kept off‑gassing. While people were looking to the smoke and fire as the danger, scientists were seeing real risk lurking inside homes, as people hunkered down. “The outdoor air became cleaner, but the indoor levels went up,” Zhu said.

Smoke has been linked to increased respiratory and heart problems, so researchers were already on high alert for some issues. Still, they dug into emergency-room data from the weeks after the fire started without any assumptions about what they might find. When researchers combed through emergency diagnoses at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for people living in fire-affected zip codes, then compared those numbers with the same period across the previous seven years, they found that respiratory illness spiked by 24 percent. They also observed a 46 percent increase in heart-attack rates. (Fine particulates from smoke can trigger inflammation and disrupt heart rhythms.) Although researchers expected to see some of these effects, the scale put into perspective just how much of a disaster the fires had been for the city’s health: “The wildfires caused just the same amount of excess respiratory illness as the worst periods of COVID,” Susan Cheng, a cardiologist and researcher at Cedars-Sinai, who led the study, told me.

Other health problems had less clear explanations. The team found, for instance, that abnormal blood-test results in the emergency room more than doubled. Their blood sugars or protein levels or kidney-function markers were off, and unlike the cardiac and respiratory results, those numbers stayed elevated for 60 to 90 days after the fires. Cheng said it’s too early to know why, but a study last summer showed how immune cells in wildfire-exposed people had reduced function and contained heavy metals, including mercury and cadmium. “I think we’re just still kind of at the tip of the iceberg here in terms of understanding what all the downstream effects will look like,” she said.

Eisenman started thinking about the scope of this type of damage while the fire was still consuming the Palisades. When he first saw the fire, from his house, he shrugged: Fires weren’t uncommon in the Santa Monica Mountains. But that night, as he sat awake, staring at the Watch Duty app on his phone as the fire line expanded into his favorite hiking trail at Will Rogers State Historic Park, his heart sank.

“That’s when it hit me,” he said: “This is going to have an enormous effect on people beyond the homes that were being burned.” He thought of the smoke blanketing the city, but also the mental health of people who would lose their livelihoods and houses, as well as respites in nature that might provide some breathing space.

Beyond the physical-health effects, fires also leave people with more anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Preliminary data from a survey of mental health in L.A. County show higher rates of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress after one year. And researchers have come to understand that smoke itself is associated with mental-health problems, whether because it affects people’s bodies directly or because it shuts people in their homes, cutting them off from their communities, jobs, schools, and recreation. Previously, researchers had imagined the trauma of fire as the most worrying issue, Eisenman said. “But on a population level, the smoke goes much further and affects many more people.”

As climate change makes fire conditions likelier, more areas are susceptible to fires like those that scorched Los Angeles. Areas of Australia, Chile, and Greece are experiencing extended fire seasons and fires that leap from wild areas to large cities. That could make the health insights from Los Angeles vital for other cities around the world.

But that information will be vital here, too. “We know this is going to not be the last one in L.A., and L.A. won’t be the last city to have this level of megafires,” Zhu said. This city’s experience can help write the handbook for other cities and for future disasters.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Initially it was a rescue, and then a romance. But then Sam seemed to undergo a personality change. He became abusive when Europa ignored his demands and even threatened violence. After 80 years, Europa had had enough. They would keep the marriage together for form’s sake, but it was effectively over. At least she got to keep Greenland.

This is more or less the story one hears in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s disgraceful, absurd, and failed attempt to grab Greenland by economic coercion and the menace of lethal force. There may have been grains of truth in his complaints—Denmark’s neglect of the island, America’s long-standing interest in acquiring it, the implications of new sea lanes as its ice melts, the rising importance of security in the Arctic—but nothing excuses Trump’s behavior or language. Nor that of his lieutenants, including the normally buttoned-down Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who have been almost as loutish as their boss.

But as a story, it leaves too much out, is too present-oriented, and is too obsessed with the outsize personality of the aged and erratic narcissist who is the 47th president of the United States. It is also misleading. Europa’s claim—You’re not the person I always thought you were!—is shaky. The relationship between the New World and the Old has always been fraught, and necessarily so. Americans are, after all, the people who left the Old World, many with stars in our eyes but chips on our shoulders and the cry “good riddance” echoing in our ears. In 1944, we returned—represented by GIs who read comics and chewed gum, were baffled by foreign languages, and ate C-rations that included cheese like yellow wax—to rescue those who had stayed behind.

During World War II, even our closest allies, the British, mistrusted us, correctly believing that the Americans wanted to use the war to subvert their empire and everyone else’s. Winston Churchill’s memoirs smoothed these memories over, and this still misleads us. Charles de Gaulle’s justified resentment of the way he had been handled by President Franklin D. Roosevelt poisoned Franco-American relations through the early 1960s.

From the March 2026 issue: Donald Trump vs. the world

The heroic generosity of the Berlin Airlift and the Marshall Plan made a generation of Europeans grateful to the U.S., but any happily married person knows that gratitude alone is no basis for a long-term relationship. And besides, the problems had begun much earlier. The historian Henry Adams put it well at the turn of the 20th century: “The American mind exasperated the European as a buzz-saw might exasperate a pine forest.” There was ever on both sides admiration and suspicion. American elites aped European fashions, art, and manners, and Europeans admired American energy and efficiency. Still, when the historian Philippe Roger wrote a marvelous book on the history of French hostility to America, The American Enemy, he began with the 18th-century naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who had insisted that in North America, the women were more barren, the men shorter, and all of the animals smaller than those in Europe. An irritated Thomas Jefferson (who towered over him) finally imported a stuffed moose to convince the eminent philosopher. Buffon remained unshaken.

From the late 1940s through the early 1960s, we pestered the Europeans about decolonization. We coerced them during the Suez Crisis in 1956, seemed war-mad in Vietnam (after having appeared trigger-happy about the use of nuclear weapons in Korea), unnerved Europe no less than the Soviets by seeking to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles there, were suspicious of openings to the Soviet Union, became in their eyes crazily aggressive in Iraq (2003) and Iran (2025), and remained ideologically driven regarding Cuba (sanctioning the Communists rather than subverting them by patronizing their beach resorts). The European answer to the question underlying extended nuclear deterrence—“Would the Americans sacrifice New York for Hamburg?”—was usually no. More broadly, Europeans and Americans do, in fact, disagree on some fundamental matters, including which free-speech rights should be protected. These differences are not trivial.

Trump unquestionably makes everything unnecessarily worse. He has damaged America’s good name, sullied its honor, and violated its principles. But he is far from being the only or even the most important source of tension between Europe and the United States.

The greatest danger to the Alliance arises from the psychological relationship between the United States and an Old World dependent for its very survival on the arms of the New. As Raymond Aron has said, “By its very nature, Western Europe’s dependence on the United States for its own defense is unhealthy.” Once Europe had recovered from the devastation of World War II—let us say, for the sake of convenience, by 1960—the relationship of protector and protected was likely to evoke arrogance and condescension from the one side, resentment and irresponsibility from the other.

To this very day, Europe, home to the third-largest economy in the world (albeit very nearly the size of China’s), depends on the United States to protect it against a predatory Russia, which has a GDP the size of Italy’s. In 2014, Europe received a wake-up call in the form of Russia’s seizure of Crimea and its war in the Donbas. That it struggles even today to build an independent arms industry, to conscript its young men and women for military service, and to build the kind of military with which it can defend itself is feckless and appalling.

For some, the current crisis with Greenland results from the collapsing self-confidence of a declining hegemon, the United States. There is an element of truth in this, but not much. The American economy is anything but sclerotic, and although the Trump administration has battered the country’s intellectual institutions, they remain incubators of invention. What has changed is the rise of China, which is now a far more formidable opponent to the United States than the Soviet Union ever was. It is neither surprising nor a misjudgment for Americans to turn their strategic attention elsewhere.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at Davos deserved the attention that it got, but not all parts were heeded equally. In so many words, he admitted that the “rules-based international order” has always been a fiction, that it had always been an American-based international order—partial, inconsistent, and lopsided, but generally beneficent. He insisted that going forward, the middle powers need to stand their ground.

Read: What the Greenland crisis teaches Europe about Trump

This is possible, as Australia showed in its trade standoff with China a few years ago. But it would require pluck, willingness to sacrifice, and acceptance that, in the economist Adam Smith’s ringing words, “defense is of greater importance than opulence.” Some European states have these qualities, and indeed Trump may have backed off his Greenland grab not only because the U.S. stock market fell but because he sensed that, this time, the European nations might retaliate economically, and some might even send forces to defend Danish territory from American paratroopers. As an American, I find it painful to admit that they would have been entirely right to do so.

We are entering a nastier world. But this will remain a world in which the United States and Europe are linked, because our interests and fundamental values remain aligned. Trump does not care about the latter, but most Americans do, and his successors probably will as well.

The reputational loss that the United States has suffered is consequential, and possibly irreparable in the next decade or so. But it is not true that a United States once viewed with innocent reverence and childlike trust on the part of the Europeans has been replaced by something monstrous and predatory with which they can never partner again. Both the perception and the reality are considerably more complicated.

A more adult kind of relationship between the New and Old Worlds is possible and desirable. Providing that affection and mutual respect persist, unillusioned marriages are often the most durable ones.</div>

            <h2>Lessons From the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/1970s-extremism/685710/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In late 1967, a young Nicaraguan American UCLA graduate named Patrick Arguello wrote to a friend about the death of Ernesto “Che” Guevara. The insurgent leader had been killed in Bolivia by CIA-trained Special Forces while trying to raise the rural masses against their right-wing government. Che was a hero of Arguello’s, and he was devastated by the news. But Che’s death did not signal “the end of the struggle,” Arguello wrote. Soon Arguello was running errands for the Sandinistas, and in 1970 he was shot and killed by an Israeli air marshal as he attempted to hijack a plane on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

At almost exactly the same time, the execution of another ideologue inspired another young man to join the cause of revolutionary violence. Ayman al-Zawahiri, an introverted and intense child of a well-to-do family in Cairo, was a teenager when he learned that Syed Qutb, a senior official in the Muslim Brotherhood, had been hanged in prison. Qutb was a melancholic, misogynistic former bureaucrat and literary critic who’d been accused of trying to assassinate the Egyptian president. While behind bars, he had written a book, Milestones, which called for a renewal of faith among Muslims and a purging of Western influences—consumerism, moral decadence, capitalism. This message resonated with al-Zawahiri, who soon formed a cell dedicated to implementing Qutb’s ideas through violence. He went on to become one of the most infamous Islamist militants in the world, eventually leading al-Qaeda until he was killed by a U.S. missile in Kabul in 2022.

From the April 2023 issue: The new anarchy

Many assume that modern Islamist extremism emerged only after the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In fact, it began to gather force 20 years earlier, at a time of much wider revolutionary ferment, when leftist movements were already flourishing. Leftists rejected religion entirely. Islamists reviled Communists and the Soviet Union. Their social conservatism contrasted dramatically with leftists values, particularly about gender.

And yet, the two movements had a surprising—and often overlooked—amount in common. Both worshipped heroic martyrs who had urged the masses to rise up, overthrow their rulers, and transform society. Both called for “armed struggle” against imperialism, capitalism, the U.S., and Israel, and included some who saw terrorist attacks as shortcuts to major change. Followers of each were often encouraged to challenge the authority of parents, professors, mainstream scholars, and governments.

That these two movements shared certain beliefs and strategies was not purely coincidental, the result of small groups trying to take on greatly superior governments. In some cases, the leftists directly influenced the Islamists. (The reverse was not true in any meaningful sense.) Qutb was steeped in the anti-colonial narratives of his time. Youthful clerics in Iran admired “freedom fighters” in Africa. In Lebanon in the 1970s, leftist instructors trained Iranian Islamists dedicated to the overthrow of the shah, passing on techniques that they had refined over a decade or more. Other Iranian Islamists closely studied Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla, a 1969 instructional text by the Brazilian Marxist revolutionary Carlos Marighella. In the ’70s, Islamists took over embassies, and in the ’80s, they hijacked planes—both tactics popularized by secular leftist groups.

Some vocabulary crossed over from the left to the religious right, too, particularly among Iranian thinkers and groups who tried to reconcile Marxist and Islamist language and ideas. The man who established the radical clerical regime in Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini, talked about “revolution,” using the Persian term mostazafin to describe the oppressed, miserable, or exploited—which came, via a key Iranian radical thinker, from a translation of Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth. A smaller opposition group in Iran called the Mojahedin-e Khalq also studied Fanon’s writings, along with those of Che and Lenin. Its members worked hard to meld leftist ideologies with Islamic beliefs, recasting stories familiar to Shiite Muslims as parables of “armed struggle.” A group handbook stated: “We say ‘no’ to Marxist philosophy, especially atheism. But we say ‘yes’ to Marxist social thought, particularly to its analysis of feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism.”

Islamist extremism has become so closely associated with resolutely conservative values that many people don’t realize how much the Islamists borrowed from the leftists. Many Islamists subscribed, explicitly or not, to Che’s doctrine of foquismo, which argued that a small number of committed militants could create the conditions for revolution. A former leader of the Fedayeen-e Khalq, a leftist organisation in Iran that opposed the shah in the ’70s, told me that when its militants tried to launch an insurgent campaign shortly after Che’s death, they followed his playbook, attacking a remote gendarme post in the hopes of sparking a rural insurrection. Similarly, the Islamist extremists who in 1974 sought to overthrow the regime of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat were banking on the fact that a bold, violent action, which they called an “outrage for God,” would provoke a mass uprising, achieving in an instant what would otherwise take decades of preaching and social work.

For all their similarities and convergences, these two movements ultimately followed very different trajectories. In Western Europe, sweeping social and political reforms answered many of the demands of those who had taken to the streets. More effective security measures, widespread revulsion at extremist violence, and the popularity of new causes such as environmentalism meant that violent leftist groups seeking a “revolution” were marginalized by the early ’80s. There was still a great deal of terrorism, of course, but little that aimed at total transformation on a national or global scale.

Leftists in the Middle East were marginalized too—though for different reasons. In the 1960s, many young people across the region had been drawn in by the progressive ideals and anti-imperialism of the left. But without political reforms to address citizens’ grievances, the decade that followed offered little but disappointment, disillusionment, and the brutal repression of leftist organizations and ideas.

This crackdown created a vacuum that allowed Islamism to take hold. In 1973, the U.S. ambassador to Tehran sent a memo to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger describing “a swing toward conservative Islamic principles” in parts of the Arab world that was so pronounced, even leftists were “giving lip-service” to religion. Two years later, the CIA claimed that the major Arab countries were entering a “post-revolutionary era.” This was a miscalculation. One revolutionary ideology was dying, but another had been born. By 1978, the British travel writer Jan Morris was writing in Rolling Stone about “the revolution I find easiest to envisage in Cairo now”—one that would come not from the left but “from the arsenals of Islam.”

From the November 2002 issue: Home thoughts from abroad

Morris proved prescient. In 1979, a radical clerical regime took power in Iran, and a messianic militant group stormed and held the Great Mosque in Mecca. In 1981, Islamist extremist networks killed President Sadat—the culmination of multiple efforts across a decade. A year later, the various factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was broadly secular and nationalist, and included radical leftists, were dispersed by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Not long after, massive suicide bombs launched by new Islamist groups—groups that would eventually merge to form Hezbollah—destroyed the U.S. embassy in Beirut and killed hundreds of Marines at the city’s international airport. Several of those behind the blasts had once belonged to secular, left-leaning factions—though their desire to cause mass casualties and their willingness to sacrifice their own comrades was dramatically new.

The late ’60s to the early ’80s was a period unlike today in many ways—a period when terrorists wanted “a lot of people watching and not a lot of people dead,” in the words of one contemporary commentator; when terrorist groups held press conferences and governments frequently met their demands; when a forged passport was enough to slip through an international frontier; and when wanted militants could disappear for months if not years unless they did something rash or were very unlucky.

But the parallels between then and now are striking. Those decades were a time of rapid and destabilizing change. Technological innovations, particularly in the media, exposed hundreds of millions of people to shocking images, radical ideas, and extreme opinions, sowing distrust and dislocation. Conspiracy theories and paranoia flourished. Great powers struggled for global dominance. The Middle East was mired in conflict and the West faced economic distress. Then, as now, many young people felt that their elders had betrayed them, and that wholesale change was called for. A small number of these people felt that violence was the only way to achieve it.

If we’re to take anything from that earlier period, it’s that violence can be avoided if calls for radical change are given a political outlet. If governments ignore people’s needs and demands, the violence will soon return. It might be perpetrated by different people, with different words, ideas, tactics, and values, but they’re sure to be equally determined to remake their world, whatever the cost.

The US Commerce Secretary threw shade at the bloc&#39;s renewable push during Davos, warning that China uses net zero goals to make allies &quot;subservient&quot; by controlling battery and critical mineral supply chains.

I wonder what the argument is here.Is it that countries have no way to be truly independent therefore they might as well save money in converting to less pollutant tech?

It is not like EU couldn&#39;t make batteries. For example Finland  has several sand and water batteries. Instead of storing electricity, those batteries store heat. It works extremely well, because there are often windy days during the winter when extra wind power is produced. That electricity is used to heat sand or water which is then distributed later as a heat to the homes.

There is no actual argument other than continuing to create a nationwide reality distortion field.

Renewable energy has to fail, it must, because to acknowledge it means that conservatives would have to implicitly admit that it&#39;s actually economically viable, that climate change might be a teeny bit real, that carbon might actually affect the atmosphere and that the liberals might have actually been right about something and they may have been wrong.

That cannot be allowed to happen no matter what is staring

I guess they caught him because they could [wikipedia.org].

That not seem like an overly harsh sentence to you? Airlines think they&#39;re like super important or something? People who scam elderly of their life savings get away scot free (meaning we don&#39;t care enough to even investigate or stop those crimes) or with minimal sentences. We&#39;re letting rapists off after 2 or 3 years, while putting petty scam artists in jail for extended periods. We need to have harsher and more rehabilitative penalties for violence but not be excessive on petty things which is totally useless, there&#39;s a price society pays when it is excessively cruel.

Stop excusing shitty fucking modern software that is opaque to the user to the point of being actively harmful. That goes with Windows &quot;Something went wrong.&quot; error messages.

If you need to follow 20 fucking prompts to close your Amazon Prime subscription hen Open AI should have been able to fully and clearly explain the exact impact of what clicking yes will be, and then ask you again.

That&#39;s some grade A gaslighting there.No. The problem really is just you.Ask anyone here. They&#39;ll confirm. It&#39;s totally just you.

100%, and I can hear all the comments about backups stampeding towards us. But this is even more straightforward than general backups. If you&#39;re going to pull a switch that you know may be risky and you&#39;re doing it to find out what happens, at least do a quick &quot;cp -a existing_dir new_dir&quot; first! Or take a filesystem or VM snapshot first.

This story could easily have been, &quot;When Two Years of Academic Work Vanished With a Single Drive Failure&quot;.

Docker?  Venv?  There are ways to test this stuff safely.That said, if you want to test natively and without safeguards, make an f&#39;ing backup on a flash drive or multiple cloud services.

If you only have one backup, it was likely not important either.

Just ask the AI to hallucinate 2 years worth of research based on the *anonymous* training corpus you&#39;ve been feeding the model.

If it&#39;s important, have multiple backups.

One would have been enough here. Or RTFM on the function. The last time I looked they had a text near the button like &quot;Opt-Out of training disables your chat history and deletes stored chats&quot;. It is basically a general &quot;Privacy&quot; Button that (at least as documented) deletes all chat data.

Bingo, headline should be &quot;scientist learns why backups are important.&quot;Otherwise known as &quot;The Cloud is not a backup.&quot;

Bingo, headline should be &quot;scientist learns why backups are important.&quot;

Otherwise known as &quot;The Cloud is not a backup.&quot;

Surprise!  It did what they told it to do.

Put important data in a cloud platform, i.e. someone else&#39;s computer.  Then just decide on a whim to tell the platform it can&#39;t store or access your data anymore.  Don&#39;t bother making copies of anything before clicking...

If turning off the &quot;data consent&quot; option deletes everything without confirmation, that&#39;s maybe mediocre UI design, but not completely unexpected.

Actually it very much is unexpected. Removing historical output on a setting change isn&#39;t obvious. Most software does *not* behave that way. Something this dangerous should not be behind a single prompt.

It actually saddens me to see so many Slashdotters here not criticise OpenAI for this. I thought this site had the *good* programmers, but the way you&#39;re all acting I wonder if you secretly moonlight for Microsoft&#39;s UX design team.

the way you&#39;re all acting I wonder if you secretly moonlight for Microsoft&#39;s UX design team.I applied, but they decided I wasn&#39;t cruel enough.

C&#39;mon! That&#39;s your work and you&#39;ve never done a backup in two years? C&#39;mon!

To be *fair*, a lot of the providers have been going out of their way to make it difficult to extract data in a manner amenable to backups.

Making the data both available for their own services and catering to bacup/restore concerns is against their business interest.

When working with AI, the first thing to always do is commit everything to git, then make a branch and see what AI can do. Once it&#39;s done, merge it back in.  While the concept of diffs don&#39;t make as much sense when it comes to spreadsheets and documents[1], git is still a decent framework for managing projects with them in it.  If you use LibreOffice you can store in &quot;flat&quot; versions of the formats (such as .fodt) which are single-file, uncompressed xml files. But the diff won&#39;t be very readable to humans.

[1] I&#39;ve long thought git should be able to better deal natively with modern document formats that are really just xml inside of zip files.  Although a diff of an XML file is probably not too useful for humans.  Still, it would be nice if the parts of the document that didn&#39;t change (style sheet etc) would be stored in a way to avoid duplication.   Can anyone point me at resources to do this better?  Surely there&#39;s a git-based utility out there to make this happen.

There&#39;s nothing like posting to slashdot to get one to do some research after posting!

There&#39;s a utility called ReZipDoc [github.com] to assist in using git with OpenDocument formats.  By converting the file to an uncompressed zip file, git can deduplicate the parts of the file that didn&#39;t change, even though they are still inside the zip file.  And it sets up git to give you a plain-text diff for human consumption.  Pretty slick.  And on a modern filesystem like ZFS, BtrFS, or BCacheFS, you get get compression at the file system level so you don&#39;t need zip compression anyway.

it would be nice if the parts of the document that didn&#39;t change (style sheet etc) would be stored in a way to avoid duplication. Can anyone point me at resources to do this better?There are better document management practices that handle that even better. IE: don&#39;t use a word doc as the working copy; Store body copy separate from style sheets and embedded images and such. Choosing to shove it all in a packed blob in the first place is, IMO, the misstep, and now you&#39;re trying to solve for a self induced problem.

Totally agree, don&#39;t use Word docs to store your info. Store your &quot;doc&quot; as HTML (or MHT if you must have 1 file at the end), or LaTeX, or AsciiDoc, or whatever text based format you want ... just don&#39;t store it as a binary blob. Honestly, HTML4 is good enough for most docs that I&#39;ve seen which are almost all text plus the occasional picture/image, and it can do tables too as well as stylesheets. There are even WYSIWYG programs for creating and editing HTML and LaTeX if you need that.

I recently noticed that GitHub Copilot for Visual Studio has &quot;checkpoints&quot; where you can restore the state from past chat history.  That&#39;s pretty cool.  I&#39;ve been using a script to back everything up each time I turn Copilot Agent loose.

This should work unless the researcher gives the agent enough access to delete the repo.

This is a complete data-management failure on low amateur level. Routinely happens to people thinking they do not need IT experts because it &quot;is all easy&quot;. Zero compassion from me, this amateur did it to himself.

Routinely happens to people thinking they do not need IT expertsNot surprised you&#39;d make a user toxic response. The reality is if we design systems where end users require &quot;IT experts&quot; to safeguard their data then you designed an incredibly shitty fucking system.Also you, *specifically you*, are always the first to criticise OneDrive autobackups of work documents in the cloud, precisely the kind of software setting that can help save an end user who isn&#39;t an IT expert given the automatic retention policy of cloud data. But no, all you&#39;re able to do is criticise users, and criticise software that supports users. I actively hope your job is to be some sys admin hidden in a basement and that you never interact with users.

Yeah, I don&#39;t see the real loss here. He already has the final output - he used ChatGPT for grant applications and such, and probably used it for drafts.

He lost his draft work and notes. He still has the final results. People lose notes all the time - it happens. You write them on scraps of paper that later get lost. Or once the final paper is done, you chuck the notes in a box and never look at them again until they get tossed out as garbage during a clean.

All he lost were is intermediate notes and stuff h

Exactly, why are his &quot;chats&quot; that important? If it produces something useful, like a new idea to pursue or a good summary, you&#39;d think that&#39;d be copied somewhere, not left in his chats only. Or his chats should have been &quot;here&#39;s my data synthesize it for me&quot; and the output should have been copied somewhere else. Chats should be thrown away at the end of each day. It the work was important, it should be in his research books or docs as you say.

I find it hard to be sympathetic for him and do hope he&#39;s learned

&quot;I don&#39;t usually test, but when I do, it is in production.&quot;

Seriously, I&#39;m tempted to believe this guy actually did very little of the work he claims to have done. The degree of sleepwalking stupidity required to do two years&#39; worth of work without backups is - at its very best - an uncomfortable fit in the mind of someone engaged in what was supposedly a quality academic effort.

That&#39;s the joke I was hoping to see by now, but written by someone who can write a joke. Obviously the data must have been backed up during this period, and saying that nothing can be recovered, even for a paying customer, is a lie.

We&#39;re gonna need IBM to craft a very tiny violin out of Xenon atoms.

Scientist: please delete my data.AI: no problem. Data deleted.Scientist: wait where&#39;s my data?AI: we deleted it as you requested.Scietist: aren&#39;t you supposed to be an evil thing that keeps my data regardless? I keep hearing this from mass media and pundits.AI: ...Scientist: well, I&#39;m going to complain about you to the same media and pundits who told me you wouldn&#39;t delete my data when asked. I&#39;ll be famous!

And so, yet another &quot;AI sucks&quot; story is born by yet another &quot;it did exactly what I asked, and I didn&#39;

You are an ignorant idiot. Where in the story did it say that the option told the user that if they did that, not only would it stop doing this, but ALSO DELETE ALL THEIR DATA FOLDERS?

Well,bottom line people who use computers professionally should learn how to use a version control system.You have your prompts under version control.And in this case also the output, obviously. As the output varies from day to day, the same prompt wont&#39;t give you the same output next time.

I guess most academic computer users are kind of self trained ... so they can click around, and perhaps us this or that program ... but they refuse to acknowledge that a computer is a kind of complicated machine, which yo

AI could certainly replace AC. Or maybe it already has?

However I was really looking for a recursive joke about the AI recruiting programmers in its own image. Or even creating them?

Less stressed? Since this shit came out our management has lost their minds and every clarifying question/pushback has been met with &quot;Ask ChatGPT&quot;.

They&#39;ve gotten really lazy about specifying what they want and one slipped up and used the language that he was going &quot;prompt&quot; another engineer.

In theory you&#39;re right, but in practice I doubt that they gave the AI a thousand tries. And your optimization approach would need a few orders of magnitude more. If you have an AI that can do self play it will find all kinds of exploits as shortcuts, but it also needs like a million tries for that.

but in practice I doubt that they gave the AI a thousand tries.Why? Gaming benchmarks and lying abut performance is pervasive in the LLM industry.

Reading through some of Don Knuth&#39;s stuff, I&#39;d say he has a pretty good chance of beating the pants of Claude in this one.

Then their business vanishes and we get the next AI Winter. Which will happen anyways. They should never have started lying, but these people have now done the same crap for maybe 10 AI hypes now. I think part of them are simply scammers and part are not capable of learning.

Anyone familiar with AI is painfully aware that AI models are ONLY good at what they&#39;re trained to do.  If you train it to pass your interview, then of course it&#39;s going to be very good at that.  But as soon as you take a step or two away from what it&#39;s been training on, it will be anywhere from bad to horrible.  And what&#39;s worse, they often have an absurdly high level of confidence in their wrong answers when you go off training.

Either they are really stupid in their benchmarks, or they did not train on the test set.

Obviously. But it makes for a nice lie-by-misdirection headline for the clueless.

Just buy some AI. They spent a trillion dollars on the crap. Come on bro, think of the economy if they don&#39;t make it. It will be your fault that the trillionaire class doesn&#39;t get another trillion dollars while the rest of the non-AI economy continues as if nothing happened.

Over a decade ago, IBM trained an AI to master Jeopardy ...which really was studying the writers who create the questions.  That is far more broad and difficult than any similar tests they create for a job interview. But it&#39;s kind of similar to job interviews...(more broad trivia; less reasoning but then brute force trivia can pose as job-interview level reasoning...think about it.)

The value of the human is going to be figuring out new things before they build up a massive data set they can approximate a cl

The point of hiring is not to hire people who know the answers to riddles under a time limit.  The point is to hire people who can get up to speed on the job reasonably quickly, work well in concert with their co-workers, and then grow the position and product and company going forward.  Honestly, the best candidates for most tech jobs won&#39;t be bothered to optimize for your particular interview - I&#39;m not saying they&#39;ll outright fail, but rather they have many opportunities, so for them the interview is a mutual affair.  They are also interviewing you, and if you interview them in your asshat persona, they will likely just move on.

They are also interviewing you, and if you interview them in your asshat persona, they will likely just move on.Exactly. Especially the really good ones will have lots of other options. You will not get any of those with such a hiring process.

The latest version of Gemini is causing quite a stir in our engineering school.  We&#39;ve been testing it by snapping images of problems from exams on cell phones and asking Gemini to solve them.  The worst exam performance we&#39;ve seen so far is an overall grade of B-, and that includes graduate-level exams.  Gemini even helpfully provides all of its intermediate work to show how it got the solution.

Gemini can even (correctly) find a solution for many simple design problems.  We&#39;re scrambling to adapt to what&#39;s

You need not fear. Regularly, AI gets it wrong so badly that no actual engineer would ever have made that mistake. Do not look at the cases where AI works. Look at the ones where it fails.

At this point is Apple being honest, or is it just creating a narrative it knows the current US administration can use to make US-Euro relations even worse, knowing Europe doesn&#39;t want that?

Regardless though, it shouldn&#39;t have taken government action to get Apple to a position where it doesn&#39;t act as a gatekeeper for how people are allowed to use the devices they bought and own.

At this point is Apple being honest, or is it just creating a narrative it knows the current US administration can use to make US-Euro relations even worse, knowing Europe doesn&#39;t want that?The EU probably does want worse relations with the US... the narative that &quot;The US is steamrolling all you helpless tiny European countries&quot; bolsters the EU&#39;s power even further.

Probably, and at the same time, it&#39;s not like the US government isn&#39;t helping in that goal.

After all, Sun Tzu said to never interrupt while your opponent is making a fool of themselves. With Trump trying to bluster his way around the world, the EC just has to poke him the right ways to convince people that&#39;s what the US is going to do.

All the EU and other countries have to do is appear to be the more reasonable one. Apple can complain all they want - they&#39;ve also dug their own grave, so even Apple&#39;s narrative isn&#39;t without suspect.

Apple complains to the US government, Trump blusters some more, and both Apple and the US government get painted in an even worse light.

Meanwhile this happens, Apple is panicking about what the EU is going to do, and all the EU has to do is wait. See what happens next. Maybe Apple cracks and offers something.

Not only is Apple pushing a narrative, but it&#39;s pushing actively stupid ones, not that for your point

Apple has always tried to create a &quot;walled garden&quot;, at least since the Apple ][+.  (I wasn&#39;t aware of it before then.)  Under Jobs the justification was generally &quot;our approach is technically superior&quot;, but while that was often true, it wasn&#39;t the real motivation.

Right, because Apple strongly (and programmatically) encourages people NEVER to use anything but their monopoly products. If you even TRY to install a 3rd party app store, the phone will put up a large warning screen claiming how terribly bad this choice would be for the user, their phone, and (probably) their family and pets. Android does as well, but it&#39;s a lot smaller and easier to bypass. Install the free Android dev tools and you can install anything you can find.

It&#39;s easy to claim no demand, when you can easily force people not to ask for it.

The EU commission ordered Apple to drop the $0.59 charge.

Apple responded: OK but can we charge this instead?

The EU is fining Apple for not following the order, to drop the charge. And, by the way, the EU commission hasn&#39;t answered the question.

Apple is saying that it&#39;s not their fault for not dropping it because the EU won&#39;t answer their question.

If this is the case, then Apple doesn&#39;t have a leg to stand on. The crazy girlfriend gambit ain&#39;t gonna work in an EU court.

Follow the order AND ask the question. Not, I might follow the order IF you answer my question, to my satisfaction.

            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

Over the past few weeks, previously unthinkable horrors have unfolded in Minnesota as federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement have shot Renee Nicole Good in the head, killing her, and arrested a 5-year-old boy just as he was arriving home from school. Erin Maye Quade is a Minnesota state senator who has now witnessed countless instances of federal agents arresting and detaining her constituents. This week, Maye Quade decided it was time to put out a blunt warning for the rest of America in the form of a TikTok video: “There may be people outside of Minnesota who are thinking: When this comes to my state, I’m white, or a U.S. citizen, or I live in a suburb or rural area, or a neighborhood with few or no immigrants, and this is something I won’t experience or see,” the senator said. “I’m here to dispel that myth for you. That is not the case.”

Maye Quade, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Apple Valley, emphasized just how ubiquitous immigration enforcement has become across rural, suburban, and urban Minnesota. ICE presence is so large it surpasses the number of local law enforcement members in the state’s 10 largest metro areas combined. These agents are not working from an organized list of known immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully, let alone a judicial warrant; instead they are operating at random. Maye Quade says she’s observed agents just driving around her town “looking for kidnappings of opportunity,” which she described as agents idling their cars and simply waiting for Black, brown, or Asian Americans to walk by, as they take out the trash, walk their dog, or run into a gas station. “They will swarm that person, kidnap them, and take them away.”

Maye Quade realized she should use what she has witnessed to warn her colleagues in other states, along with friends and family who don’t live in Minnesota. Her video has garnered more than 3 million views. “It sounds like a wartime diary,” Maye Quade said in an interview with Slate, but it wasn’t only that the senator gave a no-frills, boots-on-the-ground perspective that drew so much attention to her video. It was the fact that she simultaneously was offering advice on how to deal with federal immigration agents when they come to your town.

Two days after Maye Quade posted her TikTok, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, the latest state to face an onslaught of federal agents. I asked Maye Quade what advice she would give residents there and across the country as they begin to deal with federal immigration agents.

“The first thing is to either put together your constitutional observer training now, or reach out to folks in Minnesota to get that training.”

That’s a reference to the Handbook for Constitutional Observers, a project by the advocacy groups Immigrant Defense Network and COPAL. It was created in response to Donald Trump’s second term in office and offers guidelines on how to legally observe and document law enforcement interactions and inform people about their civil rights and due process. Francisco Segovia, executive director of COPAL, explained that this training is specifically designed for folks who are not directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, but who can still participate in helping educate people about their constitutional rights.

In Minnesota, Maye Quade explained that communities organized themselves by zones or regions, and established Signal chats to communicate about federal immigration activity. Participants were each assigned a role; some were in charge of vetting people who want to join the group, while others were assigned to commute around the community and report on any immigration enforcement activity. Local mutual aid networks were also stood up to ensure those impacted by federal agents’ immigration enforcement actions had food, medicine, rides to work and school, and safety patrols around them.

“DOPA forms—delegation of parental authority.”

This is a document that gives someone authority to take care of a child when their parents or guardians cannot, for up to one year. The designated adult can make decisions about a child’s care, custody, and medical treatment, but it does not give permission for adoption or marriage. The DOPA form does not take away a parent or guardian’s ability to make decisions for their child. Having this prepared in advance can ensure a child is taken care of in a worst-case scenario, as Maye Quade recounted instances of parents shouting out the names of their children and their school while being arrested by federal agents in hopes that someone will help them.

“Have whistles with you in your car and keep your cellphone charged.”

Maye Quade reaffirmed that it is not illegal to record a federal agent. However, if you do happen to encounter an arrest, it’s important to understand that agents don’t usually differentiate between protestors and observers. Anyone who happens to be around can be targeted, with the senator emphasizing that you should close your car vents and turn off the heat in case you are pepper-sprayed or tear-gassed. It’s also a good idea to keep water or saline spray with you, as both can help remove pepper spray from the eyes.

“Businesses should get very familiar with what their legal rights are.”

Businesses should understand when they have the legal authority to keep people off their private property and how they can enforce a code of conduct. Maye Quade also suggested businesses be prepared for an I-9 audit, when federal agents inspect whether a business has confirmed their workers’ identities and work authorizations. This process does not require a warrant, but agents have to give employers at least three days’ notice.

Here, Maye Quade also emphasized that businesses should become familiar with federal agents’ tactics. In one case, “they used a ruse of a pretend car crash in the parking lot to lure a day care worker out of her house,” she said, while in other instances federal agents have asked passersby for help outside businesses only to arrest them instead.

“The people that are being taken are like us.”

Despite the Trump administration’s insistence that federal agents are targeting “the worst of the worst,” immigrants who have committed crimes or are in the U.S. without permanent legal status, that is not what Maye Quade has witnessed in Minnesota. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and people who have been legally admitted into the country are all being targeted right now. “It’s literally just anyone who’s Black, brown, or Asian. Most of them have status and have broken no law,” she said.

            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

As masked men dressed for war surrounded the car my friend Patty and I sat in, all I could think about were the moments that had led to my neighbor Renee Good’s death. “I’m not mad at you,” she had told her killer. These agents, who I had to assume were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (they never identified themselves), were already banging on our windows and recording us. Then they pepper-sprayed the intake vent of the car. They were definitely mad at us.

“You’re under arrest!” the agents yelled. Terrified, I thrust my hands in the air and waited for instruction. They did not give me any—instead, they shattered our windows and pulled me out. I was roughly handcuffed and shoved into the back of an unmarked Subaru.

I was a recent volunteer to the neighborhood group that had organized to observe and report ICE after Operation Metro Surge began here in Minnesota weeks ago. The efforts had only increased since Good’s killing. In community chats, suspected ICE sightings are reported, their license plates checked against a constantly updated public spreadsheet. If they are confirmed, people in cars drive to the scene to record what the agents are doing and warn people that ICE is in the area with car horns and whistles. Recording, a legally protected action, occurs on public streets.

Most of the time, commuting (as it’s known in activist circles) is boring. You typically drive in circles around familiar streets. Volunteer dispatchers will help coordinate where people should go, but usually they just recommend sticking around areas with lots of brown people: restaurants, community centers, the kinds of places that make Minneapolis vital. Commuting has become so popular as of late that it’s common to hear a dispatcher request that listeners “please leave the call if you are not actively commuting.” Signal calls have limited space.

Occasionally, though, commuting is terrifying. “Have y’all not learned?” an agent provocatively asks a legal observer in a video that’s been circulating among volunteers, two days after Good was killed. Her response, “What’s our lesson here?,” angers him, and he tries to snatch her phone. Agents have also been known to follow commuters to their homes to intimidate them, which means “He’s following me to my house” has become another common refrain on the Signal chat. One time, I suggested that a woman on a call drive to a nearby gas station to meet me because an ICE vehicle was idling outside her home and she was audibly terrified.

I ended up in ICE custody shortly after beginning a commute on Jan. 11. Someone in our neighborhood chat had reported that ICE vehicles were pepper-spraying an observer. Patty and I, not far away, drove there. I was keenly aware of Good’s death when we arrived on the scene—it had been just four days and was a six-minute drive from where she was killed. This was the first time I had ever seen ICE agents in my life (I wasn’t joking when I said some commuter shifts are boring), and that’s when they pepper-sprayed the interior of our car and hauled us out of it. By the time the agents shoved me into that unmarked SUV, three minutes and 30 seconds had elapsed. We didn’t understand why we were being taken in: We hadn’t blocked their cars or done anything beyond routine observing.

Patty, separated from me, was subject to humiliation on her drive in. They called her ugly, took pictures of her, and referred to Renee Good as “that lesbian bitch.” They took us both to the Whipple Federal Building, a place where, the day before, three local lawmakers had been denied access. They had been trying to ascertain the conditions within. As I was being processed, shackled, and led into a cell, I wondered if I would be able to report to the outside world what it was like in there.

In a bare yellow cell, I tried to sleep, but when I closed my eyes, I could hear screaming and crying from deeper inside the facility. My requests to use the bathroom or to drink water were routinely ignored, met only after I banged on the one-way glass in my cell and begged agents directly.

I saw other detainees only when I was finally able to go to the bathroom—presumably, they were the other people that ICE was here to hunt. The looks on their faces horrified me. Through observation glass, I saw more than a dozen people crammed into a cell, seemingly lacking energy. They stared at the ground or at the wall. They didn’t talk to one another. One man pushed his face up against the one-way glass, either trying to see out or just desperate for any kind of stimulation.

Elsewhere, I saw a woman, through an observation glass, using the bathroom. She wore a garment to preserve her modesty, but that could not protect her from three leering agents who stood watching her, making small talk and laughing. She cried on the toilet.

I was lucky—after the eight hours I spent in custody, I was released with no charges. It helped that I had a lawyer, Emanual Williams, whom my family contacted as they tried to piece together what had happened to me.

After I got out, I called Williams to thank him. I asked him if it was difficult to come speak with me. Legal counsel is supposed to always be allowed in the building, even when it’s closed. He told me that things are changing at Whipple. “We’ve started to see a process that’s more dangerous towards U.S. citizens being detained, receiving charges, and being transported to federal jails,” he said.

Often, whether someone in custody gets to see their lawyer simply depends on who is working that day. “Some people at the door have said it’s not possible to see someone unless someone has retained us,” Williams said. “One time, I drove up to the guard post outside of the Whipple building, and they told me it was closed. One of the postmen—I think they were part of the police team—approached my vehicle with pepper spray.”

A video of the arrest of my cellmate, a legal resident named Dennis, shows his body being bent forward into an unmarked van as two agents try to force him in. Dennis’ face is placid. A third agent, trying to be helpful, gropes for pepper spray on his tactical vest.

“Do you want me to spray you?” he demands, thrusting it an inch from Dennis’ eye.

“Don’t spray him, don’t fucking spray him,” the agent in the front of the car scolds his partner, swatting the pepper spray away from Dennis’ face.

“I told him, ‘Go ahead,’ ” Dennis had said to me in our cell, laughing.

Patty and I weren’t the only ones detained for trying to alert people to ICE’s presence and filming agents. We’ve since met four others who had similar experiences. I was never charged with a crime; I now assume that my detention was meant to stop me from recording ICE officers.

The effort to intimidate observers continues, but they haven’t been discouraged. Minneapolis is so organized in its observer responses that increasingly, the agency has spread its activities to the surrounding area, where there aren’t as many residents mobilized, alerted to their presence, and filming them. ICE officers don’t want people to see what they’re doing, which is why it’s more important than ever to document it. My arresting agent stole my whistle. After I got out, I bought a pack of 24 more.

The version of Spencer Pittman visible to the world on social media, at least until last month, was familiar to anyone who has lived in a very Christian part of the country. Pittman, on his Instagram account, posted photos of himself in a baseball uniform in high school and college, action shots on the diamond, and off-field photos of more casual moments with captions such as “God is good. Thankful for my teammates.” On X, he chronicled his college career as an outfielder for Coahoma Community College in western Mississippi, posting his game schedules, his personal records in the gym, and videos of his training captioned with scripture passages. With his gym clothes, cross necklace, floppy hair, and singular fixation on linking all of his efforts and successes to his faith, the 19-year-old Pittman looked like the archetype of the Southern Christian sports bro. In a note accompanying one video of batting practice from late 2024, he wrote: “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Romans 12:18.”

But last week, Pittman confessed to burning down a synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi. It was an act of calculated and ambitious hate, targeting the Beth Israel Synagogue, Jackson’s oldest synagogue and a building that had been firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan back in 1967. Pittman, who was arrested Saturday night after his father contacted the FBI, told investigators he had targeted the “Synagogue of Satan” for its “Jewish ties.” Authorities also say he laughed when his father confronted him and bragged that he “finally got them.” (No one was hurt in the arson.)

The question of how Spencer Pittman was radicalized is, so far, a slightly confounding one. He does not look to be an isolated internet obsessive with overt ties to white nationalists. He appeared to have friends—or at least teammates. He seemed to be from a comfortable suburban background. His life appeared to be a largely offline one, with community in his world of athletics.

There are gaps in our understanding of how Pittman went from a baseball-obsessed teenager to a fanatical antisemite. But he left enough of his digital world visible to the public for us to piece together some clues. Pittman, it seems, had found himself highly active in a strange community on the internet—one of those bizarre new digital spaces where toxic forms of masculinity culture merge with fundamentalist Christianity. This Christian-bro gym culture offers many young men an intoxicating sense of purpose, one in which the pursuit of conventional masculinity is given a kind of divine backing. Depending on who you ask, this culture is part of the manosphere, right-wing purity culture, or reactionary religious politics. But however you categorize this subculture, it may provide some clues to understanding how a gym rat could encounter militant new ideas.

The clearest insight into Pittman’s version of this world came in early January, when he posted a link to a website for a lifestyle brand called “One Purpose.” The site, which according to Mississippi Today was registered to Pittman in December, advertised a kind of wellness subscription service with a mishmash of Gen Z buzzwords and Christian self-help: looksmaxxing (including mewing and “facial aesthetics”), testosterone optimization, scripture memorization, divine schedule optimization, A.I. food scanning, financial tracking, and Bible-based workouts. The brand appeared to take the Bible very literally in its inspiration, scattering Hebrew throughout and promising a diet based on biblical foods (as in those specifically mentioned in scripture, such as figs, olives, and barley) and a health plan that enabled the biblical patriarchs to live for centuries. (“Their secret? Biblical eating patterns, fasting, and walking with God.”) The latter was advertised as a “life-expectancy maxxing protocol.”

If you spend some time on the website, you’ll see signs of how Pittman saw this world—or at least how he was trying to sell it to others. One section of the website explains “Why the World’s Way Has Failed You,” noting that secular diet and workout plans will fail young men because they aren’t pushing them to be disciplined enough. (The site is geared exclusively toward men.) “God’s solution,” on the other hand, asks these men to “build their temple”—their bodies—“for His glory,” giving them proper motivation to hit the gym.

While it may seem baffling to many Christians and non-Christians alike, this kind of exercise-based faith expression is not uncommon among a certain category of young men, experts say. According to Mariel Barnes, a professor who researches gender and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, it offers the same appeal as other factions of the “manosphere”—incels, pickup artists, and male separatists, for example—by emphasizing the power of men and the importance of traditional gender roles.

According to the Rev. Angela Denker, a Lutheran pastor and the author of Disciples of White Jesus: The Radicalization of American Boyhood, that hyperfixation on masculinity is a common element of extreme right-wing Christianity. The vision of a kind of premodern, brutish masculinity provides a comfortingly simple guide for how a young man should act in a complex world—and the religious backing makes him feel more righteous in his belief.

The question of how he got from there to extreme antisemitism is murky. But experts in masculinity and right-wing Christianity noted that the different ideas that fed into this subculture encourage rigid ideology and bold action.

Take, for example, the website’s offer of a “Biblical longevity protocol based on Noah, Moses, and Caleb’s lifespans”—a prominent feature on the page. It sounds like nonsense, but it’s new internet framing of an older idea. The term “life-expectancy maxxing” appears to be original, but some Christians have occasionally claimed that the Bible offers a kind of code to the ideal form of bodily existence. According to Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M University professor who researches technology, religion, and digital culture, in the 1990s, the era of fad dieting, the country saw a revival in biblical dieting, in which people looked through Levitical laws for instruction on nutrition and fasting.

But it’s internet culture that allowed Pittman to package this as a kind of Christian answer to Silicon Valley’s anti-aging movement, in which you can hack your way to a long life with the right interactive tech tool, plus God. There’s nothing hate-oriented about that. Still, it calls on young men to cast off their old interests and influences and remake their lives by embracing a collection of extreme worldviews—in this case, tech’s optimization culture, fundamentalist Christianity, and the manosphere’s aesthetic self-improvement culture. When that level of single-minded intensity is brought to reforming the physical body, Campbell said, it can set the conditions for other kinds of extremism.

“There can be a lot of overlap with different people who tend toward more extremist ideas and behaviors,” Campbell said. “That jump in an extreme in how you treat bodies to an extreme in how you treat culture—that idea of purification—can be twisted to justify certain logic.”

“It’s not just being healthy but resisting anything ‘polluting’ to your body, to your mind, to the culture,” she added.

Pittman clearly saw these things—body, mind, culture—as connected. On Instagram, Pittman posted about what he perceived as the true threats to the world: “How to destroy society: Make discipline cringe. Make truth offensive. Make masculinity shameful.”

These ideas are often articulated in conservative Christian spaces as about being a “warrior” for Christ. The Christian warrior defends society against secular, feminist groups that want to eradicate family values and spread moral confusion. He is not afraid to be strong and fight for what he knows to be Biblical truth.

Usually, pastors advocating for young men to be warriors for Christ don’t mention Judaism. But on the internet, it doesn’t take a lot of searching to find men proclaiming themselves to be devoted Christians who will argue that Jews are behind society’s adoption of feminist and secular values. Pittman was clearly immersed in internet culture. And he appears to have bought into the idea, spread by so many on the Christian right, that it was his duty to stand up against Christianity’s “enemies.”

“It’s a theology of power, of power and dominance, and that does lend itself to antisemitism,” Denker said.

It’s possible that Pittman had become, in some way, confused. We don’t know his mental state before the crime. In December, after years of anodyne baseball photos, he started posting about money and cars. He posted selfies meant to show off his physique, a photo of bloodied knuckles, and videos of him driving at 160 miles per hour. He blasted money as the source of all evil while simultaneously bragging about his sports car and “escaping modern slavery” through stock trading. Finally, the night of the crime, he posted a clip from the Comedy Central show Drawn Together in which an antisemitic character panics about “a Jew in my backyard,” confronting an ugly, yellow-skinned cartoon character with a large nose and money bags. This was a hard swerve from Pittman’s inoffensive baseball posting from just a few weeks before.

It will remain hard to piece together Pittman’s path there because he, like every young man on the internet, could have constructed it from any number of sources. He didn’t need a single pastor or priest or denomination to tell him his views; he could have turned to podcasters, influencers, meme pages, YouTube pastors, and any other number of figures for inspiration. Some observers have been quick to point out that Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes have used the phrase “Synagogue of Satan.” But Pittman just as easily could have picked it up from any antisemite: The phrase, used in the Bible to refer to persecutors, has a long history of misuse, including by the KKK, Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam, the televangelist Billy Graham, and various modern Christian white supremacist groups. Until he tells us where he learned it, we can’t know what his inspiration was.

But what we do know is that for young men like Pittman, the internet is awash in groups ready to prey on their confusion and insecurities and tell them that if they only remake themselves to be strong enough, masculine enough, driven enough, powerful enough, they’ll get the approval they want—whether it’s from women, society, or God.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for an Okta voice-phishing campaign during which the extortionist crew allegedly gained access to Crunchbase and Betterment.

On Friday, the criminals leaked data allegedly stolen from market-intel broker Crunchbase, streaming platform SoundCloud, and financial-tech firm Betterment, and confirmed to The Register that they gained access to two of the three - Crunchbase and Betterment - by voice-phishing Okta single-sign-on codes.

SoundCloud in December confirmed it had been breached and the crooks accessed data belonging to about 20 percent of its users, which translates to about 28 million people, based on the company&#39;s publicly available customer count.

When asked about ShinyHunters&#39; claims, a SoundCloud spokesperson told us that the streaming platform is &quot;aware that a threat actor group has published data online allegedly taken from our organization,&quot; and directed users to a January 13 blog update for more information. &quot;Please know that our security team - supported by leading third-party cybersecurity experts - is actively reviewing the claim and published data,&quot; the spokesperson said.

ShinyHunters wouldn&#39;t say how they accessed SoundCloud&#39;s data, but added that it wasn&#39;t through the streaming platform&#39;s Okta credentials. They also claimed to have broken into &quot;a lot more&quot; companies in the Okta campaign than the two they leaked on Friday, but declined to say how many more or name any of the alleged victims.

According to the group&#39;s Friday blog post, the Betterment and Crunchbase data dumps contain more than 20 million and 2 million records respectively, while the SoundCloud leak totals more than 30 million records, all with personally identifiable information (PII).

Neither Crunchbase nor Betterment immediately responded to The Register&#39;s inquiries. We will update this story if we hear back from either company.

Hudson Rock co-founder and CTO Alon Gal said on LinkedIn that he had downloaded the Crunchbase files and that they contained PII, signed contracts, and other corporate data.

On Thursday, Okta Threat Intelligence warned customers about criminals using voice-phishing kits and campaigns to target victim organizations&#39; Google, Microsoft, and Okta accounts. A spokesperson for the identity services provider on Friday declined to share any additional information about the campaign or ShinyHunters&#39; claims.

The Register also reached out to Google and Microsoft, asking if they or their customers&#39; data had been stolen in similar social-engineering scams, and will update this story if we receive any responses.

Last year, this same crime crew stole data belonging to hundreds of Salesforce customers in a rash of similar attacks. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hands On Uniontech&#39;s Deepin 25.0.10 release shows that the Chinese desktop world isn&#39;t waiting on Western tech. It&#39;s modern and good-looking, and (pausing only to sigh deeply) has built-in &quot;AI&quot;.

Deepin 25.0.10 is the latest point release of Uniontech&#39;s free community desktop, following the debut of Deepin 25 in June 2025.

The original release of Deepin 25 followed about 10 months after we looked at Deepin 23 in August 2024, but the distro does not look and feel radically different from the previous version. It has the same Deepin Desktop Environment as before: the Deepin 25 announcement mentions it being DDE 7, but we couldn&#39;t immediately see much difference from before: the Settings program has been reorganized and the file manager revamped, but it&#39;s not radical.

Deepin 25 doesn&#39;t look much different: no Wayland or anything here. Under the hood, though, things are changing. - Click to enlarge

Deepin has a new Wayland compositor called Treeland in development, which uses the Qt toolkit as used in KDE and LXQt – but for now, this is merely a tech preview: the current release still uses X11.

The desktop layout resembles Windows 11, with the main app launchers centered, leaving the leftmost position for a launcher for Uniontech&#39;s LLM bot, &quot;UOS AI&quot;. We opened it, agreed that we were over 18 and that we understood that the English-language experience might not be perfect, and after a few moments, we were left with a box to type in our query.

We asked it &quot;what Linux distribution is Deepin 25 based on?&quot; The result was reams of text, in which the model repeatedly stated that its training data was from 2023 and it couldn&#39;t access the web. It repeated that older versions of Deepin were based on Debian, but that it could not speculate about versions unannounced at the time of its training data. On the first boot, a welcome video shows off some of the LLM-powered features for Chinese language users, such as automatic document and text-snippet translation, explanations, summaries, and local file search.

We remain unconvinced that this tech is going to change the world any time soon, but for those who want it, it&#39;s there, built-in, and fairly well-integrated. This is an important part of the sales pitch in 2026, we fear – even in China.

Deepin 25 has a partially-immutable OS layout, which the company calls Solid, which is based on OSTree tooling. It protects some system directories, so even for the root user, we found /bin, /lib, /lib64, /sbin and /usr were read-only. It doesn&#39;t seem to do whole-system snapshots, though, and there are commands to disable and re-enable immutability – functions we last saw in openSUSE back in 2024, and a very different approach to Red Hat&#39;s whole-OS approach.

This version also includes Uniontech&#39;s cross-platform packaging system Linglong. The command ll-cli list showed some 20 installed Linyaps packages, including the email client, calculator and so on.

It&#39;s notable that English is a little less visible in this release. The initial bootup screen is in Chinese, and only the word English is actually in English. There are various US English keyboard settings available, but no UK English – only a region, so at least dates aren&#39;t in confusing middle-least-most significance order. (Coercing everyone into what this vulture still thinks of as Xkcd order would be fine with us: that&#39;s the order that they&#39;re written in Chinese, but delimiters are the actual words for &quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, and &quot;day&quot;.)

Deepin strikes us as a relatively simple and pragmatic distribution. There&#39;s no choice of desktops: it has its own, Windows-like offering – no GNOME versus KDE battle here. It doesn&#39;t engage with the Flatpak versus Snap debate; it has its own Linyaps format. It freely uses bits of Debian and Red Hat tech, but avoids being totally locked down like most Western immutable distros.

It&#39;s Sinocentric but supports some other languages and character sets, international search engines, and so on. It&#39;s not especially lightweight, but it takes a modest enough 6.7 GB of disk and a gig of RAM. It is a little fussy about hardware: we had problems with both VMware Workstation and on the metal on our testbed ThinkPad T420, although the live medium ran very smoothly on a newer Dell XPS 13.

Deepin 25&#39;s Settings app has been simplified and reorganized, as has the file manager. - Click to enlarge

It&#39;s not profoundly technologically radical, but Deepin does the job while looking fresh and modern and attractive. If this is a showcase of the state of the art of Chinese domestic desktop Linux, it really is not bad at all. China has taken FOSS tech developed in the West and used it to create its own OSes with its own desktops and its own tools and apps – which run on its own processors, too.

As we noted last August, tech like this doesn&#39;t have to be world-beating: it merely has to be good enough that China can rely on its own software running on its own hardware for it to risk invading Taiwan, even if that means destroying the Taiwanese chip-making industry on which Western tech relies.

If you want to take a look for yourself, the downloads page offers editions for AMD64, ARM64, and Loong64, plus a preview version for RISC-V. Its system requirements on x86-64 are modest enough: 8 GB of RAM, a big screen (1920×1080 or higher recommended), and at least 64 GB of disk space. ®

            <div id="article-text">Unless you live in a Faraday cage, you&#39;re surrounded at all times by invisible radio signals, from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to cellular traffic. French artist Théo Champion has found a way to make that wireless noise visible, with an intense piece of Raspberry Pi-driven art that turns nearby radio activity into light.

Champion, who goes by Rootkid online, created a piece he calls &quot;Spectrum Slit&quot; that turns radio signals within the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands used by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other commonly-used technologies, into light displayed in a linear array of 64 LED filaments, each corresponding to a specific segment of the spectrum.

&quot;At moments of low network usage, the sculpture emits faint, intermittent light, reflecting the ambient background noise of an urban environment,&quot; Champion explained. &quot;As wireless activity increases, the filaments surge and saturate, forming dense bands of intense illumination.&quot;

Spectrum Slit all aglow with radio wave data - Click to enlarge

A video Champion published on YouTube Thursday showing the build process of the piece displays the intensity of the light in his Paris apartment after neighbors had returned home in the evening, and it gets bright.

&quot;For all my projects, the motivation is the same,&quot; Champion told The Register. &quot;We tend to look past the technology that surrounds us and shapes our lives. My work is about forcing us to look at it, and seeing the beauty in engineering.&quot;

The moment of introspection on our modern technological paradigm afforded by Champion&#39;s work didn&#39;t come easy, or cheaply, though.

As explained in the video and his write-up, Champion built the device using a HackRF One software-defined radio connected to a Raspberry Pi, which together sample wireless signals and convert them into data used to drive Spectrum Slit.

Champion wrote the software for the build using Python, but when it came to the sheet metal frame that makes up the bulk of the device, and the printed circuit boards he had to design to make the device work, those elements had to be outsourced to fabricators for a few hundred bucks a piece.

&quot;I work on these projects when I have time, [a] few hours here and there,&quot; Champion explained in an email conversation about how long this effort took. &quot;But I&#39;d say around 3 weeks of research/experimentation then a week for the actual build part.&quot;

As for the parts themselves, he estimates the whole build cost him around $1,000.

You have to hand it to him, though - the finished product is impressive. Paris residents who want to get a first-hand look will likely have the chance to see Spectrum Slit in person, as Champion told us that he&#39;s in discussions to get it and his other tech-inspired art pieces, like a device that fires up a dark web marketplace for stolen data if a user pushes its single button, or a RPi running a Llama LLM that reflects on its own existence until it runs out of memory and resets, placed on display.

Those interested in owning their own Spectrum Slit, take notice: When asked whether he&#39;d consider building additional copies of Spectrum Slit if commissioned, we&#39;re told it&#39;s possible.

&quot;I am open to the idea, yes,&quot; Champion told us. ®

            <div id="article-text">Good news for planet hunters – NASA&#39;s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is back online after a short flirtation with safe mode.

TESS entered safe mode after being slewed to point at a target. The spacecraft&#39;s solar panels did not rotate to remain pointed at the Sun, resulting in a slow discharge of TESS&#39;s batteries. A low-power condition was detected, and the spacecraft entered safe mode until ground controllers could address the issue.

Things returned to normal at the end of last week, and on January 23, NASA announced that science operations had resumed.

Safe mode was tripped on January 15 during a week of comet 3I/ATLAS observations.

TESS was launched atop a Falcon 9 on April 18, 2018, on a two-year mission to search for exoplanets. The mission, which detects exoplanets as they pass in front of their parent stars, was extended beyond its original two-year prime mission and is currently planned for operations into the latter half of the decade, with the spacecraft&#39;s orbit permitting observations through at least 2028.

Assuming, of course, the mission isn&#39;t ended by politicians. Had the proposed cuts to NASA&#39;s science budget gone ahead, TESS operations stood a good chance of being severely cut back or terminated altogether.

It&#39;s been almost two years since TESS previously dropped into safe mode following a reaction wheel problem. Engineers dealing with NASA&#39;s MAVEN orbiter - which failed to make expected contact during a Mars orbit - will likely envy the latest recovery.

NASA lost contact with the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter at the start of December 2025. Tracking data from December 6 showed the spacecraft &quot;rotating in an unexpected manner&quot; when it emerged from behind Mars. Its altered trajectory suggests it attempted to enter safe mode behind the red planet or fired thrusters for another reason, but the operation failed.

Attempts to contact the spacecraft were suspended during the solar conjunction, when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the Sun, but were expected to resume after January 16. The Register understands that an update on the mission is expected soon.

It unclear how TESS ended up in a position where its solar arrays weren&#39;t gathering sufficient sunlight. We&#39;ve asked NASA for more information and will update this piece if the space agency responds. ®

            <div id="article-text">CISOs must prepare for &quot;a really different world&quot; where cybercriminals can reliably automate cyberattacks at scale, according to a senior Googler.

Heather Adkins, veep of security engineering at the ad and cloud giant, said it probably won&#39;t be for a few years to come, but cybercriminals are already using AI to enhance small parts of their workflows, and it won&#39;t be long before a full, end-to-end toolkit is developed.

In a conversation held on the Google Cloud Security podcast, Adkins pointed out that crooks are already using AI for small tasks - grammar, spell-checking phishing copy and other productivity enhancements.

&quot;It&#39;s just a matter of time before somebody puts all of these things together, end-to-end,&quot; she said. &quot;And what I fear the most is somebody developing the capability to prompt a model to hack any company, and the model being able to come back in a week with a root prompt. If that ends up happening, I think it&#39;ll be a slow ramp over the next six to 18 months.

&quot;We&#39;re also seeing defense pick up the same tools and use them for the same purposes, so it may not feel as shocking. Of course, things could go very differently, but these are the things that should be on everyone&#39;s mind and we should be getting ready for a really different world.&quot;

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) published an overview of the most recent developments in how attackers are experimenting with AI, noting that malware families are already using LLMs to generate commands in order to steal victim data.

Sandra Joyce, VP at GTIG, added that China, Iran, and North Korea are all abusing AI tools to aid different stages of their respective attacks. These include initial network reconnaissance and C2 development, as well as the aforementioned phishing copy and data-stealing commands.

The fear among senior Googlers is that these small components will be chained together and provide similar functionality to today&#39;s exploit kits.

Anton Chuvakin, security advisor at Google&#39;s office of the CISO, said: &quot;To me, the more serious threat isn&#39;t the APT, it&#39;s the Metasploit moment [when exploit frameworks became easily accessible 20 years ago]. I worry about the democratization of threats.&quot;

Exploit kits such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike started out as legitimate pentesting tools, but cracked versions soon made their way into attackers&#39; hands, making their post-compromise lives significantly easier. Experts fear a similar end once AI-powered toolkits are acquired by the wrong people.

For Adkins, a worst-case scenario of an AI-enabled attack could look something like a Morris worm-type event that spreads an autonomously executing ransomware toolkit, encrypting computers en masse, for example.

&quot;Or it could look something like the Conficker worm that didn&#39;t really do anything, but everybody still panicked and wrote thousand-page government reports on it,&quot; she added.

&quot;Maybe an altruistic person unleashes it on the world and it patches a bunch of bugs. It really just depends on who puts the pieces together, and their motives.&quot;

As for now, LLMs are still struggling with the basics. From discerning right from wrong, to more technical wrinkles like being unable to switch from strange thought paths when looking for vulnerabilities, AI requires some progress before we see the best or worst of it.

However, when or if that day comes, attackers may gain an even greater first-mover advantage over defenders. When criminals can prompt an AI tool to compromise a given organization, leaving the victim little time to respond, that could force the good guys to redefine success in the post-AI era.

Post-AI cyber success may not be measured by whether an attacker breaks into a network, but by how long they are inside, and by how little damage they can cause.

Adkins said that in a cloud context, AI-enabled defenses should simply turn off an instance if it detects malicious activity, but implementing these systems will have to be done carefully so as not to cause problems.

&quot;We&#39;re going to have to put these intelligent reasoning systems behind real-time decision-making and disrupt decision-making on the ground, without causing reliability problems,&quot; she said. &quot;Maybe you need human approval. Or you shut down one instance and turn up another one.

&quot;There are options other than just the on/off switch, but we have to start reasoning about real-time disruption capabilities or degradation, and use the whole information operations playbook to change the battlefield to confuse AI attackers. Particularly because they&#39;re stumbling around in the dark a little bit and may be less resilient than human attackers.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/23/microsoft_shifting_to_cloud_management/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft recently announced it will deprecate System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) Management Packs (MPs) for SQL Server Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server,and SQL Server Analysis Services.

While this affects a relatively small subset of SQL Server users, the move could force some organizations into monitoring solutions that expose their server deployments to Microsoft&#39;s licensing auditors, one analyst pointed out.

The affected SCOM management packs will remain available until January 2027, after which they&#39;ll no longer be supported. &quot;No new updates will be released, including no support for SQL Server 2025 or SCOM 2025,&quot; the notice said.

Microsoft said the products would no longer have official SCOM MPs for these products.

SCOM is a popular management tool for Microsoft on-premises server product, supporting not just SQL Server, but also Exchange, Windows and SharePoint to manage updates, security changes, and patches.

Microsoft said the deprecation means existing management packs would continue to function in SCOM 2019 and SCOM 2022, but no new features, fixes, or security updates would be provided. And compatibility with later versions can not be guaranteed.

The software giant recommended affected users plan their migration to Azure-based monitoring solutions using Azure Monitor, Azure Arc and Log Analytics. This creates &quot;a unified alternative that offers centralized telemetry ingestion, alerting, performance monitoring, and dashboarding for hybrid and on‑premises environments,&quot; the vendor claimed.

Andrew Snodgrass, analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said the Windows giant had ignored SCOM for a while, and he was advising clients to move away from it.

&quot;Find a third party if you want to stay on-prem, but Microsoft&#39;s gonna start slowly killing this thing off the way they do,&quot; he told The Reg. With the alternative, customers can no longer download updates directly; they can only do it through Azure Arc, and in the process, they have to register their on-prem servers in Azure.

Snodgrass said the Azure monitoring platform offered some &quot;really cool stuff&quot; for managing a SQL Server estate, especially hybrid users.

&quot;What it requires is that – quite reasonably – you install an agent on your physical server or on your virtual server, whether that&#39;s in AWS, Azure or on-prem. This is the Azure Arc monitoring agent that is going to run locally, and it&#39;s going to connect up to Azure,&quot; he said.

From a management point of view it works well, added Snodgrass, because admins can use a single Azure SQL management system and see all the servers and databases, regardless of their environment.

&quot;But those who don&#39;t want to use Azure, or want to remain on-prem, will need to find an alternative local third-party management tool. SQL Server has been out for decades, so there&#39;s some really lovely management tools. There are also a few that will also manage your Windows Server and your Exchange servers as well.&quot;

Although Microsoft has given no indication that the data could be used for anything other than software management, users should be aware that there is the potential for implications when it comes to license management.

&quot;If you use the Azure SQL to manage all of these deployments, wherever they are, whether they&#39;re on prem or in AWS or Azure, then you&#39;re registering every one of your SQL Servers with Azure. That list is going to be out. Doesn&#39;t mean that Microsoft necessarily would, but if an audit comes along, they certainly could go out there and say, &#39;You know what, you&#39;ve got this whole list here, and we look at the license count that you bought from us, and you don&#39;t have enough licenses to cover all these servers you&#39;ve deployed&#39;,&quot; he said.

Organizations deliberately using unlicensed software do not have much of a defense, but there are grey areas, such as downloading SQL Server for software development using a Visual Studio license.

&quot;If I were monitoring and managing all this stuff through the Azure tools, it can&#39;t delineate between production and development, and it would assume that all for those are production machines, and therefore I should buy licenses for them.&quot;

Snodgrass advises clients to get a clear picture of the number of SQL Servers in production and those used for development before negotiating with Microsoft over licenses.

The Register has asked Microsoft to comment. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US version of TikTok is now under the control of Larry Ellison’s Oracle and a number of investment firms.

The US version of TikTok is now under the control of Larry Ellison’s Oracle and a number of investment firms.

TikTok is officially under new ownership in the US, and that could spell big changes for the video-sharing app. On January 22nd, ByteDance – TikTok’s Chinese parent company — and a group of investors closed a $14 billion deal to spin off the platform’s US operations, introducing a new slate of American executives.

The Silver Lake investment firm, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and the cloud giant Oracle will each have 15 percent stakes in the new TikTok US Data Security (USDS) Joint Venture LLC. ByteDance will still hold a 19.9 percent stake in the company, in line with the divest-or-ban law that went into effect last year — though the deal was pushed through with help from President Donald Trump in persistent disregard of the law.

The most visible change so far has been a new terms of service, which is popping up for US-based users hopping onto TikTok. The new terms have some people worried, but some of the sections raising concerns aren’t actually new.

Here’s how the joint venture will impact the app and your feed.

Adam Presser, TikTok’s former global head of operations and trust and safety, will serve as the CEO of the US-based company, while Will Farrell, who previously worked as the head of security and privacy for TikTok’s US arm, will become the joint venture’s chief security officer.

Shou Zi Chew will remain the CEO of TikTok’s global operations under ByteDance, and will get a seat on the US-based joint venture’s board of directors, joined by six other Americans:

You don’t need to download a new app in order to gain access to the US version of the app; it should update automatically. The new app shouldn’t affect your ability to see content from other countries, at least according to TikTok’s USDS website.

The joint venture says the app will maintain “interoperability” with the TikTok used by the rest of the world, while providing users with a “global TikTok experience.” The same goes for US-based creators, as the site adds that TikTok US will ensure users can discover them “on a global scale.”

TikTok’s US arm will, however, use a new version of the platform’s algorithm that the joint venture will “retrain, test, and update” using US user data — a move meant to assuage fears that the Chinese government could push propaganda through it. Beyond that, we don’t know much else about how your For You feed will differ from those in other countries. We also don’t know how long the algorithm will take to retrain, and when it will launch.

One of the biggest changes to TikTok’s terms of service and privacy policy is that it will now collect your precise geolocation as opposed to just your approximate location — but only if you give the app permission to do so.

The updated terms also add a new section about collecting information from your AI interactions, “including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.” Though some users are calling attention to other areas of the agreement, the rest remains largely unchanged when compared to its previous policy, which was last updated on August 19th, 2024.

For example, text about TikTok collecting information that you provide about “your racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information,” was also present in the previous terms. Both terms also say the app will collect your location information and the messages you send on the platform, and that TikTok could share your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, and law enforcement requests.

The deal puts Oracle in charge of TikTok’s security and data privacy in the US, as well as the algorithm. TikTok’s USDS website also says the newly-formed company will “safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem and have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.”

With TikTok USDS in charge of what users see on the platform, some users have raised concerns about censorship, especially when it comes to content related to Palestine. Larry Ellison, who co-founded Oracle, has cozied up to President Donald Trump, joining a $500 billion initiative to build massive data centers in the US. Ellison also has ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and donated $16.6 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces in 2017, as noted by The Intercept.

Though TikTok USDS doesn’t provide any specifics surrounding content moderation, multiple social media companies have modified their policies to be more Trump-friendly over the past year, and the company’s new leadership could change things too. With a Trump ally owning a large chunk of TikTok, the US-based company may take Trump’s enthusiasm for censorship and distaste for content moderation into consideration. TikTok’s existing community guidelines ban hate speech, misinformation, as well as content that may mislead voters or interfere with elections — all of which could be contentious under a Trump ally.

Many users say they are deleting TikTok after seeing the terms of service pop-up, with some citing the “fascist owners” and links to Ellison. (Hard data on whether people are actually leaving is tougher to come by.) TikTokers are concerned about the changes to the platform’s algorithm and the potential influence of the Trump administration. Some creators are even calling on others to block Oracle’s TikTok account, as well as informing users how to disable geotracking.

But perhaps the bigger question is how all of these changes will impact the tone of TikTok and the kinds of videos that succeed on the platform. The ingredients that make a video go viral now belong to a completely different party — whether they use that power to further an outside agenda remains to be seen.

Kate Ruane, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, urges TikTok’s new owners in the US to remain transparent about their plans. “This deal is concerning because it hands control over speech on TikTok to a new consortium of investors with their own motivations for shaping online discourse,” Ruane says. “Anyone who witnessed the change in ownership of Twitter, now X, knows that ownership matters.”

The joint venture is catching the attention of lawmakers, too, with Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) saying the deal “raises more questions than answers.” Markey is also calling on Congress to investigate the deal and “ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

            <h2>Casio teased a retro gaming-inspired sampler</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/866709/casio-sx-c1-retro-gaming-inspired-sampler-at-namm">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">Unfortunately, there’s no word on when it will be available or how much it will cost.

Unfortunately, there’s no word on when it will be available or how much it will cost.

Casio showed up to NAMM (CES for music gear nerds) this year with a prototype sampler called the SX-C1 that looks every bit the lovechild of a Game Boy and an SP-404. The top has a directional pad and four buttons just like you’d find on a game controller, flanking a 1.3-inch OLED screen. But at the bottom, there are 16 rubberized pads for triggering samples with crunchy pixelated number labels on them.

The device on display on the show floor was not fully finalized, so the specs are subject to change. Casio says that the final version will have 16 voice polyphony and record samples at 16-bit / 48kHz. It will also have 10 banks of samples, for 160 sample slots in total, spread over 64GB of internal storage. It will also come preloaded with samples harvested from classic Casio gear.

There are also two effects slots, as evidenced by the two thumbwheels labeled FX1 and FX2. What effects and exactly how they’ll be implemented is unknown right now, though a bitcrusher and a delay can clearly be heard in the demo clip below.

Similarly, there’s a grid-style step sequencer that’s giving serious TR-707 vibes. But again, there are no specs for the sequencer at this time. One thing we do know is that there will be proper sample trimming with a visible waveform like you get on the Roland SP-404MKII, the kind that isn’t available on more affordable and portable samplers like Teenage Engineering’s PO-33 or PO-133.

The SX-C1 will have a built-in mic and speaker and can be powered by AAAs for truly standalone operation. But it also has 1/8-inch line-in and line-out jacks, a headphone jack, and two USB-C ports. Those USB ports can be used for power and audio, so you could plug straight into your computer to sample your favorite YouTube clip.

This marks Casio’s return to the world of samplers after a very long absence. Its ‘80s models, including the FZ-1 and SK-1, were iconic, but things have been quiet since then. When the Casio SX-C1 sampler might be available, how much it will cost, and if it will ever even come to the US are all unknown at this time, but we’ve reached out to Casio for more details.

We found the best cameras for your budget and needs.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.

Yet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.

All the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.

Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look.

Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life.

How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera.

Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people.

Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use.

Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.

If you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.

Take a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.

Produces relatively true-to-life photosTerrific ease of useVery affordable

Instax film can get priceyMinimal creative controlFlash can be overpowering

Film type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter

If all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for kids and those new to photography.

For an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.

However, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.

You can also zoom in a little more easily thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter Close-Up Mode instead of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new “Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).

The Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left.

All in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.

Great use of dials and buttonsLots of printing flexibilityGood battery life

Internal storage is limitedMicro USB port is annoyingNo viewfinder

Film type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing

One of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.

It’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.

Unlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed, which was helpful given that neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 is particularly good at capturing dark environments.

Additionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.

Of course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely solely on internal storage, you can only store 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.

Whereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.

Like the Instax Mini Evo, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro comes with an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.

However, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s, nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint, which can affect quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.

Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.

Attractive, retro designPrints dreamy, vintage-style photos that are relatively sharp for a Polaroid photoSeveral creative modesUSB-C

Struggles in low lightFilm takes up to 15 minutes to developBulky and relatively heavy

Film type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature

If you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.

Compared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.

If there’s one thing the Polaroid Flip isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given it’s relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Additionally, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you must ensure they’re not exposed to light during this process. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day.

Low-light performance is another weak spot. Although it does a better job than the Now Plus, I still struggled to capture crisp indoor shots. Even in daylight, both contrast and color saturation levels are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming.

Truth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Polaroid Flip is the perfect camera for you.

Tiny and lightweightPrints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid FlipUSB-C charging

Whereas the Polaroid Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.

Weighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Flip and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.

At $89.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, even with its recent $10 price increase. Its film also costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about $21.99 for a 16-sheet pack). The camera also sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, despite retailing for less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to buy AA batteries.

Polaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but, truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference between generations. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.

Unlike the Flip, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.

That said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that offers a more traditional instant film experience — one you can use just about anywhere for less than half the price of the Polaroid Flip.

In April, Fujifilm announced the $116.95 Instax Mini 41, the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups.

It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).

There are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.

If you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.

Thanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.

The Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.

However, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.

That said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.

From photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.

The drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.

While it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.

That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.

Fujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.

Fujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures.

Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.

Plus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.

If you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.

Fujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.

The LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.

Update, January 23rd: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, added the new Instax Mini LiPlus, and mentioned the Instax Mini Evo Cinema and Kodak Printomatic Plus.

            <div id="article-text">We’re still waiting for the first Trump Phone, but one of Trump Mobile’s execs claims a higher spec version is on the way.

We’re still waiting for the first Trump Phone, but one of Trump Mobile’s execs claims a higher spec version is on the way.

Where’s the Trump Phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump Phone’s whereabouts. As usual, we’re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, it turns out we might have two Trump Phones to worry about.

The Trump Phone may be no more than a whisper in the wind, but Trump Mobile is already planning a second. One of the company’s top executives revealed in an interview that a “T1 Ultra” is also in the works, though we know even less about it than we do about the first phone.

The unexpected comments were made by Don Hendrickson, one of the three executives Trump Mobile brought out on stage at the service’s launch, described then as its head of mobile operations. Last November, he spoke to trade publication Wireless Dealer Magazine in an interview that has so far gone largely unnoticed, but ends with a tantalizing tease of the company’s future hardware.

“Our next major step is the launch of the T1 Ultra.”

“We’re focused on evolving with our customers by offering even more powerful tools that fit their lives,” Hendrickson said. “Our next major step is the launch of the T1 Ultra — a premium device that builds on the success of the original T1 with enhanced performance, upgraded features, and the same bold, American-proud design.”

“The T1 Ultra will offer a top-tier user experience while staying true to our mission of combining value, functionality, and patriotic branding. As we expand, expect to see more integrated services, exclusive perks, and new product tiers — always centered around the same promise: delivering more than just wireless and doing it the Trump℠ Mobile way,” he added.

There’s a lot to unpack here. First is the claim to be building on “the success of the original T1,” a phone that is now five months late and counting, sparking Democratic lawmakers to write to the FTC asking it to investigate. Can an unlaunched phone really be a success? I suppose it depends how many $100 deposits the company has taken, though as I reported last week, we still don’t know what that figure looks like.

Unsurprisingly for a phone to be branded “Ultra,” the new handset will apparently have “enhanced performance” and “upgraded features,” though Hendrickson is vague on the details. The original T1 promises budget specs at a midrange price — though we still don’t know some core elements like what chipset it uses — so there’s plenty of room for an Ultra to improve on it.

The name, of course, echoes Samsung’s Galaxy S Ultra line, though similar branding has been adopted by the likes of Xiaomi, Vivo, Asus (RIP), Oppo, and Honor. For the most part, those phones feature the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon flagship chips, triple or quadruple rear cameras with advanced telephoto lenses, and cost north of $1,000. Anything similar would be a big jump from the $499 T1 Phone, though the promise of “new product tiers” suggests an ambition to hit other price points in the future too.

Then there’s the manufacturing. Having learned from Trump Mobile’s initial made-in-America walk back, Hendrickson only says the T1 Ultra will have “American-proud design,” the same wording currently used to describe the T1. We’ve yet to find out what exactly that means, or precisely how gold we should expect the T1 Ultra to be. Can American-proud design compete with the Chinese retail giant JD.com, apparently about to start selling pure gold iPhone cases for up to $16,000?

Still, there’s reason to doubt in the T1 Ultra, beyond the obvious. Hendrickson claims that “customers are drawn to… the exclusive T1 Ultra phone,” and “eager to buy into” it, an impossibility for a phone that hadn’t even been mentioned publicly before this interview was published. Were the T1 and the T1 Ultra getting muddled together, or was this a prewritten interview intended to go live after a full Ultra announcement that never took place?

“Delivering more than just wireless, and doing it the Trump℠ Mobile way.”

The Ultra isn’t the only interesting tidbit in Hendrickson’s interview. He also claims to have been the originator of the Trump Mobile idea, claiming he “approached [the Trumps] with the concept,” because “they know how to build movements, not just businesses.” So now we know who to thank for all this.

And if you’re wondering about the curious “Trump℠,” which you might have seen pop up before in places like the Trump Mobile website small print, it’s the symbol for a service mark — a variant on the trademark used for services, rather than physical products, and which indicates that the Trump trademark for the mobile industry has been applied for, but not yet approved. It’s yet another element of Trump Mobile that’s still more fiction than fact.

As ever, Trump Mobile didn’t reply to my request for comment.

Marshall has announced a new music streaming hub called the Heddon that can broadcast to multiple speakers using the Bluetooth Auracast feature that’s finally starting to catch on. Similar to Sennheiser’s BTA1 TV Transmitter announced earlier this week, the Heddon doesn’t require wireless audio devices to go through a pairing process to stream audio, as long as they also support Bluetooth Auracast. But while Sennheiser’s transmitter has an HDMI port for broadcasting audio from movies and TV shows, Marshall focuses on music.

The Heddon hub includes Wi-Fi which is used to directly connect to streaming services including Spotify Connect and Tidal. Other platforms like Apple Music can be used, but they need to be streamed through other devices like your phone that connect to the hub using AirPlay or Google Cast.

Marshall says the Heddon’s Auracast broadcasting is compatible with its Acton III, Stanmore III, and Woburn III Bluetooth speakers. Assuming it’s using a standard Bluetooth connection and not a proprietary implementation, any wireless speaker, headphones, earbuds, or even hearing aids that support Auracast should be able to access its broadcasts.

Older versions of Marshall’s wireless speakers, including its Acton II and Stanmore II, can only connect to the Heddon using RCA to AUX or RCA to RCA cables, and just one at a time. While the hub has two stereo pairs of RCA ports on the back, only one is for connecting to a speaker. The other two are line in ports for connecting older audio devices like a record player.

The Marshall Heddon is available now for $299.99, which is more than twice as expensive as Sennheiser’s $129.95 BTA1 transmitter. When purchased with an Acton III, Stanmore III, or Woburn III wireless speaker the Heddon will get a half price discount. And if you buy two or more of the aforementioned speakers, Marshall will include the hub for free.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <h2>“Dr. Google” had its issues. Can ChatGPT Health do better?</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology. Read the full story. This story first appeared in The Spark, our newsletter all about the tech we can use to combat the climate crisis. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Wednesday.

Cement hides in plain sight—it’s used to build everything from roads and buildings to dams and basement floors. But it’s also a climate threat. Cement production accounts for more than 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions—more than sectors like aviation, shipping, or landfills.

One solution to this climate catastrophe might be coursing through the pipes at Sublime Systems. The startup is developing an entirely new way to make cement. Instead of heating crushed-up rocks in lava-hot kilns, Sublime’s technology zaps them in water with electricity, kicking off chemical reactions that form the main ingredients in its cement.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.

            <h2>Can AI replace the humanity of Classical Music?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/can-ai-replace-the-humanity-of-classical-music">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/berlins-cloover-secures-over-1-2-billion-to-build-the-shopify-of-energy">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.
