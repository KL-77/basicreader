            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Black holes have long captured the imagination of both scientists and the general public. These exotic objects—once thought to be merely hypothetical—have also conceptually inspired countless artists all over the world. A generous sampling of such work is featured in Conjuring the Void: The Art of Black Holes.

Author Lynn Gamwell spent ten years as director of the New York Academy of Science’s Gallery of Art and Science. She has an extensive background writing about the intersection of math, art, and science. So she was a natural choice to speak at the annual conference of Harvard’s interdisciplinary Black Hole Initiative a few years ago. Gamwell focused her talk on the art of black holes, and thus the seeds for what would become Conjuring the Void were sown.

“I was just astounded at how much art there is [about black holes], and I was specifically interested in Asian art,” Gamwell told Ars. “There’s just something about the concept of a black hole that resonates with the Eastern tradition. So many of the themes—the science of black holes, void, nothingness, being inescapable—relate to the philosophy of Buddhism and Taoism and so on.”

Gamwell opens the book by chronologically summarizing key developments in the science of black holes, from Isaac Newton and John Mitchell’s 1783 concept of “dark stars,” to the predictions of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and such Nobel Prize-winning discoveries as the LIGO collaboration’s 2016 detection of gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes, and the Event Horizon Telescope’s first image of a black hole in 2019. That discussion provides a springboard to showcase all the examples of black-hole-inspired art Gamwell unearthed during her research, from early 20th century illustrations to cutting-edge contemporary art.

Gamwell sees echoes of Mitchell’s dark stars, for instance, in Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, “A Descent Into the Maelstrom,” particularly the evocative 1919 illustration by Harry Clarke. “This seemed to have been an early analogy to a black hole for many people when the concept was first proposed,” said Gamwell. “It’s a mathematical construct at that point and it’s very difficult to imagine a mathematical construct. Poe actually envisioned a dark star [elsewhere in his writings].”

The featured art spans nearly every medium: charcoal sketches, pen-and-ink drawings, oil or acrylic paintings, murals, sculptures, traditional and digital photography, and immersive room-sized multimedia installations, such as a 2021-2022 piece called Gravitational Arena by Chinese artist Xu Bing. “Xu Bing does most of his work about language,” said Gamwell. For Gravitational Arena, “He takes a quote about language from Wittgenstein and translates it into his own script, the English alphabet written to resemble Chinese characters. Then he applies gravity to it and makes a singularity. [The installation] is several stories high and he covered the gallery floor with a mirror. So you walk upstairs and you see it’s like a wormhole, which he turns into an analogy for translation.”

“Anything in the vicinity of a black hole is violently torn apart owing to its extreme gravity—the strongest in the universe,” Gamwell writes about the enduring appeal of black holes as artistic inspiration. “We see this violence in the works of artists like Cai Guo-­ Qiang and Takashi Murakami, who have used black holes to symbolize the brutality unleashed by the atomic bomb. The inescapable pull of a black hole is also a ready metaphor for depression in the work of artists such as Moonassi. Thus, on the one hand, the black hole provides artists with a symbol to express the devastations and anxieties of the modern world. On the other hand, however, a black hole’s extreme gravity is the source of stupendous energy, and artists such as Yambe Tam invite viewers to embrace darkness as a path to transformation, awe, and wonder.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/in-the-90s-wing-commander-privateer-made-me-realize-what-kind-of-games-i-love/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since 1993, I think I’ve unconsciously judged almost every game by how well it can capture how Wing Commander: Privateer made me feel.

Steam and PlayStation (the two platforms I use the most) have been doing a year-in-review summary akin to the wildly popular Spotify Wrapped for the past few years. Based on these, I can report that my most-played games in 2025 were, from most hours down:

With the exceptions of Civilization VII and Unreal Tournament, every one of those games is some kind of open-world experience that’s all about immersing you in a far-flung land (or galaxy).

I like what I like, and my knowing that’s what I like began in the early 1990s with Wing Commander: Privateer.

Privateer taught me that I love games that are spaces for living out whatever fictional life I create for myself much more than I love games that are guiding me through an authored story and a series of carefully designed challenges.

Yes, it has a story and story missions, but they’re hardly the point, partly because they’re not really that good. What’s exciting about this game is exploring new systems, seeing the beautiful CG artwork for their settlements, learning about your ships’ capabilities and upgrading them slowly over time, and attaining mastery of the pseudo-simulated economy.

The story that matters in Privateer is the story I am telling myself in my head. To this day, the games I most love offer at least a taste of that experience.

To say this game was influential on later titles would be an understatement, but we, of course, have to acknowledge that this formula was originally popularized by 1984’s Elite. Privateer just married that formula with Wing Commander‘s universe and flight mechanics, with a far more hand-crafted setting. That setting is key, though. I like the original Elite, and this certainly wasn’t the case back in the mid-’80s, but today, it plays like a tech demo for what’s to come.

Privateer was the full package. Later, we got the X series, EVE Online, Elite Dangerous, Starfield, and even No Man’s Sky, a game I love so much I’m literally writing the book on it.

None of those games was made by Privateer lead Chris Roberts, of course. He would go on to work on Freelancer, probably the most accessible space trading/pirating game ever made, and an underappreciated gem, even if it didn’t live up to the hype that surrounded it. (Roberts left the project mid-way, and it was finished by others who dropped many of his impossibly ambitious ideas for it.)

Now we have Star Citizen. We here at Ars have covered that game as much as anybody, and it’s fair to say a lot of the coverage has not been positive. I won’t retread all that drama here; if you know, you know, and if you don’t, it’s easy to dig up.

But all that is to say that there are few space games today that aren’t directly inspired by Wing Commander: Privateer, and Privateer inspired me too: it inspired me to love sandbox and open-world games.

It’s odd that a game that was so heavily inspired by a title almost a decade its senior (Elite) still managed to be ahead of its time, and maybe that says as much for Elite as it does for Privateer

Privateer was re-released with Windows support via GOG in 2011, but it took me until recently to revisit it for the first time since the 1990s. Yes, it has ancient graphics now, but they’re endemic to a particular era of PC game graphics that I find extremely nostalgic, so they work for me.

In terms of mechanics and systems, everything Privateer does is done far better and to greater depths by at least one later space game. And to boot, it has more friction and frustrations, and while the game is ultimately pretty easy once you get the hang of it, it’s hard to learn.

But like Freelancer after it, it hits a sweet spot balancing all these aspects that makes it still stand out. Elite Dangerous is the best at the simulation and economy aspects, Star Citizen has more impressively realized ships and settlements, and No Man’s Sky is more accessible while still delivering on the fantasy (and it offers a much wider range of activities).

I don’t know if it’s just nostalgia for that aforementioned 1990s DOS game aesthetic speaking, though, but I’m of the opinion that none of Privateer‘s spiritual successors have matched the character and draw of its setting. Seeing this side of the Wing Commander universe is a treat, and I feel that not even modern games that were entirely about having that same sense of culture and place (like Starfield, for example) don’t quite get there.

I’d be curious how it reads to people who never played it back in the day, though. Like I said, this is a pantheon game for me. If someone who plays Elite Dangerous, Starfield, Star Citizen, or No Man’s Sky today goes back and tries Wing Commander: Privateer out, does it hold up for them, too?

If that describes you and you give it a shot, let me know.

            <div id="article-text">When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out Civilization 7, Avowed, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Grand Theft Auto 6 as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year’s list of Ars’ favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the “expected” side of this year’s list.

But the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best Geometry Wars clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.

As we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed Grand Theft Auto VI chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.

When I was younger, I wanted—and expected—virtually every game I played to blow me away with something I’d not seen before. It was easier to hit that bar in the ’90s, when both the design and technology of games were moving at an incredible pace.

Now, as someone who still games in his 40s, I’m excited to see that when it happens, but I don’t expect it, Now, I increasingly appreciate games that act as a sort of comfort food, and I value some games as much for their familiarity as I do their originality.

That’s what Assassin’s Creed Shadows is all about (as I wrote when it first came out). It follows a well-trodden formula, but it’s a beautifully polished version of that formula. Its world is grand and escapist, its audio and graphics presentation is immersive, and it makes room for many different playstyles and skill levels.

If your idea of a good time is “be a badass, but don’t think too hard about it,” Shadows is one of the best Assassin’s Creed titles in the franchise’s long history. It doesn’t reinvent any wheels, but after nearly two decades of Assassin’s Creed, it doesn’t really need to; the new setting and story are enough to separate it, while the gameplay remains familiar.

No game this year has made me feel as hated as Avowed. As an envoy for the far-off Aedryan empire, your role in Avowed is basically to be hated, either overtly or subtly, by almost everyone you encounter in the wild, semi-colonized world of the Living Lands. The low-level hum of hatred and mistrust from the citizens permeates everything you do in the game, which is an unsettling feeling in a genre usually characterized by the moral certitude of heroes fighting world-ending evil.

Role-playing aside, Avowed is helpfully carried by its strong action-packed combat system, characterized as it is by thrilling moment-to-moment positional jockeying and the juggling of magic spells, ranged weapons, and powerful close-range melee attacks. The game’s quest system also does a good job of letting players balance this combat difficulty for themselves—if a goal is listed with three skull symbols on your menu, you’d best put it off until you’ve leveled up a little bit more.

I can take or leave the mystical mumbo-jumbo-filled subplot surrounding your status as a “godlike” being that can converse with spirits. Aside from that, though, I’ve never had so much fun being hated.

The term “walking simulator” often gets thrown around in some game criticism circles as a derisive term for a title that’s about nothing more than walking around and looking at stuff. While Baby Steps might technically fit into that “walking simulator” model, stereotyping it in that way does this incredibly inventive game a disservice.

It starts with the walking itself, which requires meticulous, rhythmic manipulation of both shoulder buttons and both analog sticks just to stay upright. Super Mario 64, this ain’t. But what starts as a struggle to take just a few short steps quickly becomes almost habitual, much like learning to walk in real life.

The game then starts throwing new challenges at your feet. Slippery surfaces. Narrow stairways with tiny footholds. Overhangs that block your ridiculously useless, floppy upper body. The game’s relentless mountain is designed such that a single missed step can ruin huge chunks of progress, in the proud tradition of Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.

This all might sound needlessly cruel and frustrating, but trust me, it’s worth sticking with to the end. That’s in part for the feeling of accomplishment when you do finally make it past that latest seemingly impossible wall, and partly to experience an absolutely gonzo story that deals directly and effectively with ideas of masculinity, perseverance, and society itself. You’ll never be so glad to take that final step.

The idea of bouncing a ball against a block is one of the most tried-and-true in all of gaming, from the basic version in the ancient Breakout to the number-filled angles of Holedown. But perhaps no game has made this basic concept as compulsively addictive as Ball x Pit.

Here, the brick-breaking genre is crossed with the almost as storied shoot-em-up, with the balls serving as your weapons and the blocks as enemies that march slowly but relentlessly from the top of the screen to the bottom. The key to destroying those blocks all in time is bouncing your growing arsenal of new balls at just the right angles to maximize their damage-dealing impact and catching them again so you can throw them once more that much faster.

Like so many roguelikes before it, Ball x Pit uses randomization as the core of its compulsive loop, letting you choose from a wide selection of new abilities and ball-based attacks as you slowly level up. But Ball x Pit goes further than most in letting you fuse and combine those balls into unique combinations that take dozens of runs to fully uncover and combine effectively.

Add in a deep system of semi-permanent upgrades (with its own intriguing “bounce balls around a city builder” mini game) and a deep range of more difficult settings and enemies to slowly unlock, and you have a game whose addictive pull will last much longer than you might expect from the simple premise.

Usually, when formulating a list like this, you can compare a title to an existing game or genre as a shorthand to explain what’s going on to newcomers. That’s nearly impossible with Blue Prince, a game that combines a lot of concepts to defy easy comparison to games that have come before it.

At its core, Blue Prince is about solving the mysteries of a house that you build while exploring it, drafting the next room from a selection of three options every time you open a new door. Your initial goal, if you can call it that, is to discover and access the mysterious “Room 46” that apparently exists somewhere on the 45-room grid. And while the houseplan you’re building resets with every in-game day, the knowledge you gain from exploring those rooms stays with you, letting you make incremental progress on a wide variety of puzzles and mysteries as you rebuild the mansion from scratch again and again.

What starts as a few simple and relatively straightforward puzzles quickly unfolds fractally into a complex constellation of conundrums, revealed slowly through scraps of paper, in-game books, inventory items, interactive machinery, and incidental background elements. Figuring out the more intricate mysteries of the mansion requires careful observation and, often, filling a real-life mad scientist’s notepad with detailed notes that look incomprehensible to an outsider. All the while, you have to manage each day’s limited resources and luck-of-the-draw room drafting to simply find the right rooms to make the requisite progress.

Getting to that storied Room 46 is enough to roll the credits on Blue Prince, and it serves as an engaging enough puzzle adventure in its own right. But that whole process could be considered a mere tutorial for a simply massive endgame, which is full of riddles that will perplex even the most experienced puzzlers while slowly building a surprisingly deep story of political intrigue and spycraft through some masterful environmental storytelling.

Some of those extreme late-game puzzles might be too arcane for their own good, honestly, and will send many players scrambling for a convenient guide or wiki for some hints. But even after playing for over 100 hours over two playthroughs, I’m pretty sure I’m still not done exploring all that Blue Prince has to offer.

This one will be controversial: I love Civilization VII.

Civilization VII launched as a bit of a mess. There were bugs and UI shortcomings aplenty. Most (but not all) of those have been addressed in the months since, but they’re not the main reason this is a tricky pick.

The studio behind the Civilization franchise, Firaxis, has long said it has a “33/33/33″ approach to sequels in the series, wherein 33 percent of the game should be familiar systems, 33 percent should be remixes or improvements of familiar systems, and 33 percent should be entirely new systems.

Critics of Civilization VII say Firaxis broke that 33/33/33 rule by overweighting the last 33 percent, mainly to chase innovations in the 4X genre by other games (like Humankind). I don’t disagree, but I also welcome it.

Credit is due to the team at Firaxis for ingeniously solving some longstanding design problems in the franchise, like using the new age transitions to curb snowballing and to expunge systems that become a lot less fun in the late game than they are in the beginning. Judged on its own terms, Civilization VII is a deep, addictive, and fun strategy game that I’ve spent more than 100 hours playing this year.

My favorite Civ game remains Civilization IV, but that game still runs fine on modern systems, is infinitely replayable out of the box, and enjoys robust modding support. I simply didn’t need more of the same from this particular franchise; to me, VII coexists with IV and others on my hard drive—very different flavors of the same idea.

I’m not sure I like what my minor CloverPit obsession says about me. When I fell into a deep Balatro hole last year, I could at least delude myself into thinking there was some level of skill in deciding which jokers to buy and sell, which cards to add or prune from my deck, and which cards to hold and discard. In the end, though, I was as beholden to the gods of random number generation as any other Balatro player.

Cloverpit makes the surrender to the vagaries of luck all the more apparent, replacing the video-poker-like systems of Balatro with a “dumb” slot machine whose handle you’re forced to pull over and over again. Sure, there are still decisions to make, mostly regarding which lucky charms you purchase from a vending machine on the other side of the room. And there is some skill involved in learning and exploiting lucky charm synergies to extract the highest expected value from those slot machine pulls.

Once you’ve figured out those basic strategies, though, CloverPit mostly devolves into a series of rerolls waiting for the right items to show up in the shop in the right order. Thankfully, the game hides plenty of arcane secrets beneath its charming PS1-style spooky-horror presentation, slowly revealing new items and abilities that hint that something deeper than just accumulating money might be the game’s true end goal.

It’s this creepy vibe and these slowly unfolding secrets that have compelled me to pour dozens of hours into what is, in the end, just a fancy slot machine simulator. God help me.

Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson; Windows, MacOS

Jenny is your average suburban Asian-American teenager, struggling to balance academic achievement, chores, an overbearing mother, romantic entanglements, and a healthy body image. What sounds like the premise for a cliché young adult novel actually serves to set up a compelling interactive narrative disguised as a mere mini-game collection.

Consume Me brilliantly integrates the conflicting demands placed on Jenny’s time and attention into the gameplay itself. Creating a balanced meal, for instance, becomes a literal test of balancing vaguely Tetris-shaped pieces of food on a tray, satisfying your hunger and caloric limits at the same time. Chores take up time but give you money you can spend on energy drinks that let you squeeze in more activities by staying up late (but can lead to debilitating headaches). A closet full of outfits becomes an array of power-ups to your time, energy, or focus.

It takes almost preternatural resource management skills and mini-game execution to satisfy all the expectations being placed on you, which is kind of the meta-narrative point. No matter how well you do, Jenny’s story develops in a way that serves as a touching semi-autobiographical look at the life of co-creator Jenny Jiao Hsia. That biography is made all the more sympathetic here for an interactive presentation that’s more engaging than any young adult novel could be.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach should not be fun. Much like its predecessor, the latest release from famed game designer Hideo Kojima is about delivering packages—at least on the surface. Yet the process of planning your routes, managing inventory, and exploring an unfathomably strange post-apocalyptic world remains a winning formula.

The game again follows Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus) on his quest to reconnect the world as humanity faces possible extinction. And yes, that means acting like a post-apocalyptic Amazon Prime. Standing in the way of an on-time delivery are violent raiders, dangerous terrain, and angry, disembodied spirits known as Beached Things.

It’s common to hear Death Stranding described as a walking simulator, and there is indeed a lot of walking, but the sequel introduces numerous quality-of-life improvements that make it more approachable. Death Stranding 2 has a robust fast-travel mechanic and better vehicles to save you from unnecessary marches, and the inventory management system is less clunky. That’s important in a game that asks you to traverse an entire continent to deliver cargo.

Beyond the core gameplay loop of stacking heavy boxes on your back, Death Stranding 2 has all the Kojima vibes you could want. There are plenty of quirky gameplay mechanics and long cutscenes that add depth to the characters and keep the story moving. The world of Death Stranding has been designed from the ground up around the designer’s flights of fancy, and it works—even the really weird stuff almost makes sense!

Along the way, Death Stranding 2 has a lot to say about grief, healing, and the value of human connection. The game’s most poignant cutscenes are made all the more memorable by an incredible soundtrack, and we cannot oversell the strength of the mocap performances.

It may take 100 hours or more to experience everything the game has to offer, but it’s well worth your time.

Since the days of Donkey Kong Country, I’ve always felt that Mario’s original ape antagonist wasn’t really up for anchoring a Mario-level platform franchise. Donkey Kong Bananza is the first game to really make me doubt that take.

Bonanza is a great showcase for the new, more powerful hardware on the Switch 2, with endlessly destructible environments that send some impressive-looking shiny shrapnel flying when they’re torn apart. It can’t be understated how cathartic it is to pound tunnels up, down, and through pretty much every floor, ceiling, and wall you see, mashing the world itself to suit your needs.

Bonanza also does a good job aping Super Mario Odyssey’s tendency to fill practically every square inch of space with collectible doodads and a wide variety of challenges. This is not a game where you need to spend a lot of time aimlessly wandering for the next thing to do—there’s pretty much always something interesting around the next corner until the extreme end game.

Sure, the camera angles and frame rate might suffer a bit during the more chaotic bits. But it’s hard to care when you’re having this much fun just punching your way through Bananza’s imaginative, colorful, and malleable world.

For a series that has always been about dodging, Doom: The Dark Ages is much more about standing your ground. The game’s key verbs involve raising your shield to block incoming attacks or, ideally, parrying them back in the direction they came.

It’s a real “zig instead of zag” moment for the storied Doom series, and it does take some getting used to. Overall, though, I had a great time mixing in turtle-style blocking with the habitual pattern of circling-strafing around huge groups of enemies in massive arenas and quickly switching between multiple weapons to deal with them as efficiently as possible. While I missed the focus on extreme verticality of the last two Doom games, I appreciate the new game’s more open-world design, which gives completionist players a good excuse to explore every square inch of these massive environments for extra challenges and hidden collectibles.

The only real problem with Doom: The Dark Ages comes when the game occasionally transitions to a slow-paced mech-style demon battle or awkward flying dragon section, sometimes for entire levels at a time. Those variations aside, I came away very satisfied with the minor change in focus for a storied shooter series.

Anyone who has read my book-length treatise on Minesweeper knows I’m a sucker for games that involve hidden threats within a grid of revealed numbers. But not all variations on this theme are created equal. Dragonsweeper stands out from the crowd by incorporating a simple but arcane world of RPG-style enemies and items into its logical puzzles.

Instead of simply counting the number of nearby mines, each number revealed on the Dragonsweeper grid reflects the total health of the surrounding enemies, both seen and unseen. Attacking those enemies means enduring predictable counterattacks that deplete your limited health bar, which you can grow through gradual leveling until you’re strong enough to kill the game’s titular dragon, taunting you from the center of the field.

Altogether, it adds an intriguing new layer to the logical deduction, forcing you to carefully manage your moves to maximize the impact of your attacks and the limited health-restoring items scattered throughout the field. And while finishing one run isn’t too much of a challenge, completing the game’s optional achievements and putting together a “perfect” game score is enough to keep puzzle lovers coming back for hours and hours of compelling logical deduction.

At first blush, Nightreign feels like a twisted perversion of everything that has made FromSoft’s Souls series so compelling for so many years. What was a slow-paced, deliberate open-world RPG has become a game about quickly sprinting across a quickly contracting map, leveling up as quickly as possible before taking on punishing bosses. A moody solitary experience has become one that practically requires a group of three players working together. It’s like an Elden Ring-themed amusement park that seems to miss the point of the original.

Let the purists belly ache about how it’s not really Elden Ring. They’re right, but they’re missing the point. Nightreign condenses the general vibe of the Elden Ring world into something very different but no less enjoyable. What’s more, it packs that vibe into a tight experience that can be easily squeezed into a 45-minute sprint rather than requiring dozens of hours of deep exploration.

That makes it the perfect excuse to get together with a few like-minded Elden Ring-loving friends, throw on a headset, and just tear through the Lands Between together for the better part of an evening. As Elden Ring theme parks go, you could do a lot worse.

Ghost of Yotei from Sucker Punch Productions starts as a revenge tale, featuring hard-as-nails Atsu on the hunt for the outlaws who murdered her family. While there is plenty of revenge to be had in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, the people Atsu meets and the stories they have to tell make this more than a two-dimensional quest for blood.

The game takes place on the northern Japanese island of Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido) several centuries after the developer’s last samurai game, Ghost of Tsushima. It has a lot in common with that title, but Ghost of Yotei was built for the PS5 and features a massive explorable world and stunning visuals. It’s easy to get sidetracked from your quest just exploring Ezo and tinkering with the game’s photo mode.

The land of Ezo avoids some of the missteps seen in other open-world games. While it’s expansive and rich with points of interest, exploring it is not tedious. There are no vacuous fetch quests or mindless collecting (or loading screens, for that matter). Even when you think you know what you’re going to find at a location, you may be surprised. The interesting side quests and random encounters compel you to keep exploring Ezo.

Ghost of Yotei’s combat is just as razor-sharp as its exploration. It features multiple weapon types, each with unlockable abilities and affinities that make them ideal for taking on certain foes. Brute force will only get you so far, though. You need quick reactions to parry enemy attacks and strike back—it’s challenging and rewarding but not frustrating.

It’s impossible to play Ghost of Yotei without becoming invested in the journey, and a big part of that is thanks to the phenomenal voice work of Erika Ishii as Atsu. Some of the game’s pivotal moments will haunt you, but luckily, the developer has just added a New Game+ mode so you can relive them all again.

There’s a moment in the second section of Hades 2 where you start to hear a haunting melody floating through the background. That music gets louder and louder until you reach the game’s second major boss, a trio of sirens that go through a full rock-opera showtune number as you dodge their bullet-hell attacks and look for openings to go in for the kill. That three-part musical presentation slowly dwindles to a solo as you finally dispatch the sirens one by one, restoring a surprisingly melancholy silence once more.

It’s this and other musical moments casually and effortlessly woven through Hades 2 that will stick with me the most. But the game stands on its own beyond the musicality, expanding the original game’s roguelike action with a compelling new spell system that lets you briefly capture or slow enemies in a binding circle. This small addition adds a new sense of depth to the moment-to-moment positional dance that was already so compelling in the original Hades.

Hades 2 also benefits greatly from the introduction of Melinoe, a compelling new protagonist who gets fleshed out through her relationship with the usual rogue’s gallery of gods and demigods. Come for her quest of self-discovery, stay for the moments of musical surprise.

A quickie sequel in the year or two after Hollow Knight’s out-of-nowhere success in 2017 might have been able to get away with just being a more-of-the-same glorified expansion pack. But after over eight years of overwhelming anticipation from fans, Silksong had to really be something special to live up to its promise.

Luckily, it is. Silksong is a beautiful expansion of the bug-scale underground universe created in the first game. Every new room is a work of painterly beauty, with multiple layers of detailed 2D art drawing you further into its intricate and convincing fallen world.

The sprawling map seems to extend forever in every direction, circling back around and in on itself with plenty of optional alleyways in which to get lost searching for rare power-ups. And while the game is a punishingly hard take on action platforming, there’s usually a way around the most difficult reflex tests for players willing to explore and think a bit outside the box.

Even players who hit a wall and never make it through the sprawling tunnels of Silksong’s labyrinthine underground will still find plenty of memorable moments in whatever portion of the game they do experience.

In a real-time-strategy genre that can often feel too bloated and complex for its own good, The King Is Watching is a streamlined breath of fresh air. Since the entire game takes place on a single screen, there’s no need to constantly pan and zoom your camera around a sprawling map. Instead, you can stay laser-focused on your 5×5 grid of production space and on which portion of it is actively productive under the king’s limited gaze at any particular moment.

Arranging tiles to maximize that production of basic resources and military units quickly becomes an all-consuming juggling act, requiring constant moment-to-moment decisions that can quickly cascade through a run. I’m also a big fan of the game’s self-selecting difficulty system, which asks you to choose how many enemies you think you can take in coming waves, doling out better rewards for players who are willing to push themselves to the limit of their current capabilities.

The bite-size serving of a single King Is Watching run ensures that even failure doesn’t feel too crushing. And success brings with it just enough in the way of semi-permanent ability expansions to encourage another run where you can reach even greater heights of production and protection.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance was a slog that I had to will myself to complete. It was sometimes a broken and janky game, but despite its warts, I saw the potential for something special. And that’s what its sequel, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, has delivered.

While it’s still a slow burn, the overall experience has been greatly refined, the initial challenge has been smoothed out, and I’ve rarely been more immersed in an RPG’s storytelling. There’s no filler, as every story beat and side quest offers a memorable tale that further paints the setting and characters of medieval Bohemia.

Unlike most RPGs, there’s no magic to be had, which is a big part of the game’s charm. As Henry of Skalitz, you are of meager social standing, and many characters you speak to will be quick to remind you of it. While Henry is a bit better off than his humble beginnings in the first game, you’re no demigod that can win a large battle single-handedly. In fact, you’ll probably lose fairly often in the early goings if more than one person is attacking you.

Almost every fight is a slow dance once you’re in a full suit of armor, and your patience and timing will be the key to winning over the stats of your equipment. But therein lies the beauty of KC:D II: Every battle you pick, whether physical or verbal, carries some weight to your experience and shapes Bohemia for better or worse.

After the incredible success of Mario Kart 8 and its various downloadable content packs on the Switch, Nintendo could have easily done a prettier “more of the same” sequel as the launch-window showcase for the Switch 2. Instead, the company took a huge gamble in trying to transform Mario Kart’s usual distinct tracks into a vast, interconnected open world.

This conceit works best in “Free Roam” mode, where you can explore the outskirts of the standard tracks and the wide open spaces in between for hundreds of mini-challenges that test your driving speed and precision. Add in dozens of collectible medallions and outfits hidden in hard-to-reach corners, and the mode serves as a great excuse to explore every nook and cranny of a surprisingly detailed and fleshed-out world map.

I was also a big fan of Knockout Mode, which slowly whittles a frankly overwhelming field of 24 initial racers to a single winner through a series of endurance rally race checkpoints. These help make up for a series of perplexing changes that hamper the tried-and-true Battle Mode formula and long straightaway sections that feel more than a little bit stifling in the standard Grand Prix mode. Still, Free Roam mode had me happily whiling away dozens of hours with my new Switch 2 this year.

For decades now, I’ve been looking for a twin-stick shooter that fully captures the compulsive thrill of the Geometry Wars franchise. Sektori, a late-breaking addition to this year’s top games list, is the first game I can say does so without qualification.

Like Geometry Wars, Sektori has you weaving through a field filled with simple shapes that quickly fill your personal space with ruthless efficiency. But Sektori advances that basic premise with an elegant “strike” system that lets you dash through encroaching enemies and away from danger with the tap of a shoulder button. Advanced players can get a free, instant strike refill by dashing into an upgrade token, and stringing those strikes together creates an excellent risk-vs-reward system of survival versus scoring.

Sektori also features an excellent Gradius-style upgrade system that forces you to decide on the fly whether to take basic power-ups or save up tokens for more powerful weaponry and/or protection further down the line. And just when the basic gameplay threatens to start feeling stale, the game throws in a wide variety of bosses and new modes that mix things up just enough to keep you twitching away.

Throw in an amazing soundtrack and polished presentation that makes even the most crowded screens instantly comprehensible, and you have a game I can see myself coming back to for years—until my reflexes are just too shot to keep up with the frenetic pace anymore.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tis the season when professional Santas are in peak demand, but many who choose this line of work often view it as a higher calling and maintain some aspects of the identity all year round—even those who don’t fit the stereotypical popular image of Santa, according to a paper published in the Academy of Management Journal.

Co-author Christina Hymer of the University of Tennessee got the idea for the study during the COVID pandemic, when she spent a lot of time watching Christmas movies with her toddler. One favorite was 2003’s Elf, starring Will Farrell as a full-sized human raised among elves who goes to New York City to find his biological father. The film prompted her to wonder about why someone would want to be Santa Claus and what their experiences in that role would be.

Hymer and her co-authors partnered with the leader of a “Santa school” to analyze archival surveys of 849 professional Santas, and conducted a new survey of another 382 Santas. They also did over 50 personal interviews with professional Santas. (One subject showed up in full costume for his zoom interview, with a North Pole background, and signed off with a merry “ho! ho! ho!”)

Hymer et al. found that professional Santas tend to fall into one of three categories. The first is a prototypical Santa: straight, portly white men with natural white beards. There are also semi-prototypical Santas who might fit the traditional physical characteristics in some respects but not others—they might be younger, or slimmer, or clean-shaven. Finally, there are non-prototypical Santas who are well outside the traditional depiction: people of color, women, disabled Santas, or LGBTQ+ Santas.

“There are pretty strong societal expectations around what Santa looks like, but we found that most anybody can be Santa if their heart desires it,” said co-author Borbala Csillag of Oregon State University. “When we looked at the people behind the suit, we found that the folks playing Santa are really more diverse than would be expected. The expectations for playing the role may seem exclusive, but they are surmountable. Think about your attributes in a comprehensive way so you can identify the dimensions of the role that are well-fitting. You will likely find attributes that map to that calling, even if they are not obvious at first.”

Frankly, what’s most interesting about the paper isn’t those three fundamental categories, but the personalized glimpses it gives of the people who choose to become professional Santas. While a few Santas might make six figures, most do not, and may even lose money being Santa—they do it anyway for the sheer love of it. Professional Santas usually don’t see the role as seasonal; many build their identities around it, whether they fit the stereotypical Kris Kringle image or not. “My feeling is, if you’re Santa all the time, you have to live as Santa and give up whoever you are,” said one subject. “I’m just striving to be a better person.”

They’ll wear red and green all year round, for instance, or maintain a full white beard.  One Santa trained himself to make “Ho, ho, ho!” his natural laugh. Another redecorated his house as “Santa’s house,” complete with Christmas trees and Santa figurines.

Sometimes it’s viewed as a role: a gay professional Santa, for instance, deliberately suppresses his sexual orientation when playing Santa, complete with partnering with a Mrs. Claus for public appearances. However, a female Santa who goes by Lynx (professional Santas typically take on pseudonyms) who is also a church leader, likens the job to a divine calling: “I can connect with people and remind them they’re loved,” she said. (She also binds her breasts when in costume because “Santa doesn’t have them double-Ds.”)

Perhaps that sense of a higher calling is why even non-prototypical Santas like Lynx persevere in the fact of occasional rejection. One Black Santa recalled being denied the position at a big box store once the interviewer found out his ethnicity, telling him the store didn’t hire Black or Hispanic Santas. “That hurt my heart so much,” he said. A disabled Santa who uses a scooter during parades recalled being criticized by other professional Santas for doing so—but stuck with it.

And while Bad Santa (2003) might be a fun holiday watch, actual “bad Santas” caught smoking, drinking, swearing, or otherwise behaving inappropriately are not popular figures within their community. “You’re never off,” one subject opined. “You lose a little bit of your identity because you can’t let your hair down and be yourself. You don’t know who’s watching you.”

“You’re Santa Claus 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year,” another Santa said. “If you act out, you risk shattering the magic.”

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/speed-act-passes-in-house-despite-changes-that-threaten-clean-power-projects/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The House of Representatives cleared the way for a massive overhaul of the federal environmental review process last Thursday, despite last-minute changes that led clean energy groups and moderate Democrats to pull their support.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.

The bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.

Critics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines, and wind and solar projects on federal land.

Speaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.

“What was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said.

After the bill’s passage through the House on Thursday, the SPEED Act’s Democratic cosponsor, Golden, praised the bill’s success.

“The simplest way to make energy, housing, and other essentials more affordable is to make it possible to actually produce enough of it at a reasonable cost,” Golden said in a press release following the vote. “The SPEED Act has united workers, businesses, and political forces who usually oppose each other because scarcity hurts everyone.”

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill aims to reform the NEPA process in several key ways. First, it makes changes to the ways agencies comply with NEPA—for example, by creating exemptions to when a NEPA review is required, and requiring agencies to only consider environmental impacts that are directly tied to the project at hand.

It would also drastically shorten the deadline to sue a federal agency over its permitting decision and constrain who is eligible to file suit. Current law provides a six-year statute of limitations on agency decisions for permitting energy infrastructure, and two years for transportation project permits. Under the SPEED Act’s provisions, those deadlines would be shortened to a mere 150 days and only allow lawsuits to be filed by plaintiffs who demonstrated in public comment periods that they would be directly and negatively impacted by the project.

NEPA does not require the government to make particular decisions about whether or how to move forward with a project based on a review’s findings. However, critics argue that in the decades since its passage, interest groups have “weaponized” the NEPA process to delay or even doom projects they oppose, sometimes forcing agencies to conduct additional analyses that add costly delays to project timelines.

Although climate activists and environmental groups have used NEPA to oppose fossil fuel projects, such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, oil and gas interests are far from the only group seeking respite. Some voices within the clean energy industry have called for permitting reform, too, arguing that delays stemming from the current permitting process have had a negative impact on America’s ability to build out more climate-friendly projects, including some offshore wind projects and transmission lines to connect renewables to the grid.

So when Westerman and Golden introduced the SPEED Act in the House, a hodgepodge of odd alliances and opposition groups formed in response.

The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, launched a seven-figure advertising campaign in recent months pushing lawmakers to pursue permitting reform, according to a report from Axios. And the bill also initially enjoyed support from voices within the clean power industry. However, last-minute changes to the bill—designed to win over Republican holdouts—undermined the SPEED Act’s cross-sector support.

The bill’s opponents had previously raised alarm bells that fossil fuel interests would disproportionately benefit from a more streamlined review process under the current administration, citing President Donald Trump’s ongoing war against wind and solar energy projects.

In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to pause, reconsider, or revoke already approved permits for renewable energy projects it dislikes. Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.

A bipartisan amendment to the SPEED Act, added during the Natural Resources Committee’s markup in November, sought to address some of those concerns by adding language that would make it more difficult for the administration to “revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere” with an existing authorization.

However, that measure encountered resistance from key Republican voices who support Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects.

On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in the Rules Committee were able to amend the SPEED Act in a way that would facilitate the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to axe renewable energy projects. The changes were spearheaded by Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), two vocal proponents of Trump’s energy policies. The amendment fundamentally undermined the technology-neutral aspirations of the bill—and any hope of receiving widespread support from moderate Democrats or the clean power industry.

According to Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, Harris and Van Drew’s amendment would allow the administration to exclude any project from the bill’s reforms that the Trump administration had flagged for reconsideration—something the administration has done repeatedly for renewable projects like offshore wind.

The result, Davis argued, is that the bill would speed up the environmental review process for the Trump administration’s preferred sources of energy—namely, oil and gas—while leaving clean energy projects languishing.

“They couldn’t pass the rule on Tuesday to even consider this bill without making it even better for the fossil fuel industry and even worse for the clean energy industry,” Davis said.

In a public statement following Thursday’s vote, Davis described the amended SPEED Act as “a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk to help big polluters.”

The American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable energy industry, previously hailed the bill as an important step forward for the future of clean energy development. But after the Rules Committee’s changes on Tuesday, the organization dropped its support.

“Our support for permitting reform has always rested on one principle: fixing a broken system for all energy resources,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a Wednesday statement. “The amendment adopted last night violate[s] that principle. Technology neutrality wasn’t just good policy—it was the political foundation that made reform achievable.”

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a nonprofit trade and advocacy organization, echoed that sentiment.

“Durable, bipartisan, technology-neutral permitting reforms that support and advance the full suite of American electricity resources and the necessary expansion of transmission infrastructure to get that electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed are essential to meeting that challenge reliably, securely, and most importantly, affordably,” said ACORE CEO Ray Long. “Unfortunately, the changes made on the House floor are a disappointing step backward from achieving these objectives.”

Following the SPEED Act’s passage through the House on Thursday, advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) issued a public statement praising the bill’s success while noting how the recent amendments had affected the law.

“While we are concerned that post committee additions to the bill could put the certainty of a range of projects at risk, this bill’s underlying reforms are critical to advancing American energy,” CRES President Heather Reams said in the statement.

Even before the move to strip protections for renewables from the bill, some critics—like Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—said that the legislation didn’t go far enough to curtail the president’s “all-out assault” against clean power, arguing that the bill does nothing to restore approvals that have already been canceled by the administration and doesn’t address other roadblocks that have been put in place.

“The administration cannot be trusted to act without specific language, in my view, to protect the clean energy projects already in the pipeline and to prevent the Interior Secretary from unilaterally stopping projects that are needed to lower costs and improve grid reliability,” Levin told Inside Climate News in an interview ahead of the House vote.

Both Levin and Davis pointed to a July memo from the Department of Interior that requires all wind and solar projects on federal land to receive higher-level approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“The administration is not even returning the phone calls of project developers. They are not responding to applications being submitted,” Davis said. “That sort of approach is in stark contrast with the ‘white glove, concierge service’—and that’s a quote from the Trump administration—the service they are providing for fossil fuel companies to access our public lands.”

The SPEED Act’s opponents also dispute the idea that NEPA reviews are one of the primary causes of permitting delays, arguing that reports from the Congressional Research Service and other groups have found little evidence to support those claims.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute, in a September interview with Inside Climate News.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said, like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Debate over NEPA and the reform of the permitting process will now move into the Senate, where experts say the SPEED Act will likely undergo further changes.

“I think as the bill goes forwards in the Senate, we’ll probably see a neutral, across-the-board approach to making sure the process is fair for all technology types,” Xan Fishman, an energy policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center told ICN after Thursday’s vote.

Fishman stressed it would be crucial to ensure permits for projects wouldn’t suddenly be cancelled for political reasons, but said he was optimistic about how the SPEED Act would be refined in the Senate.

“It’s great to see Congress so engaged with permitting reform,” he said. “Both sides of the aisle see a need to do better.”

This was a pretty good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Streaming platforms reigned supreme, with Netflix and Apple TV dominating our list with seven and five selections each. Genre-wise, we’ve got a bit of everything: period dramas (The Gilded Age, Outrageous), superheroes (Daredevil: Born Again), mysteries (Ludwig, Poker Face, Dept. Q), political thrillers (The Diplomats, Slow Horses), science fiction (Andor, Severance, Alien: Earth), broody fantasy (The Sandman), and even an unconventional nature documentary (Underdogs).

As always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2025.

Most of us have seen a nature documentary or two (or three) at some point in our lives, so it’s a familiar format: sweeping, majestic footage of impressively regal animals accompanied by reverently high-toned narration (preferably with a tony British accent). Underdogs takes a decidedly different approach. Narrated with hilarious irreverence by Ryan Reynolds, the five-part series highlights nature’s less cool and majestic creatures—the outcasts and benchwarmers more noteworthy for their “unconventional hygiene choices” and “unsavory courtship rituals.” (It’s rated PG-13 due to the odd bit of scatalogical humor and shots of Nature Sexy Time.)

Each of the five episodes is built around a specific genre. “Superheroes” highlights the surprising superpowers of the honey badger, pistol shrimp, and the invisible glass frog, among others, augmented with comic book graphics; “Sexy Beasts” focuses on bizarre mating habits and follows the format of a romantic advice column; “Terrible Parents” highlights nature’s worst practices, following the outline of a parenting guide; “Total Grossout” is exactly what it sounds like; and “The Unusual Suspects” is a heist tale, documenting the supposed efforts of a macaque to put together the ultimate team of masters of deception and disguise (an inside man, a decoy, a fall guy, etc.). Green Day even wrote and recorded a special theme song for the opening credits.

While Reynolds mostly followed the script (which his team helped write), there was also a fair amount of improvisation—not all of it PG-13. The producers couldn’t use the racier ad-libs. But some made it into the final episodes, like Reynolds describing an aye-aye as “if fear and panic had a baby and rolled it in dog hair.” We also meet the velvet worm, which creeps up on unsuspecting prey before squirting disgusting slime all over their food, and the pearl fish, which hides from predators in a sea cucumber’s butt, among other lowly yet fascinating critters. Verdict: Underdogs is positively addictive. It’s my favorite nature documentary ever.

Dep. Q is a rare show that commits to old tropes—an unlikable but smart central character revisits cold cases—and somehow manages to repackage them in a way that feels distinctive. To get a sense of the show, you only have to describe its precise genre. You might call it a murder mystery, and there are murders in it, but one of the mysteries is whether a key player is alive or not, given that a lot of her story takes place in flashbacks with an uncertain relationship to the present. It’s almost a police procedural, except that many of the police are only following procedures grudgingly and erratically. It’s not really a whodunnit, given that you only end up learning who done some of it by the time the first season wraps up. And so on.

Amid all the genre fluidity, the show does a great job of balancing the key challenge of a mystery program: telling you enough that you can make reasonably informed guesses on at least some of what’s going on without giving the whole game away and making it easy to figure out all the details. And the acting is superb. Matthew Goode does a nice job of handling the central character’s recent trauma while helping you understand why he has a few loyal co-workers despite the fact that he was probably unlikable even before he was traumatized. And Alexej Manvelov (who I’d never seen before) is fantastic as a former Syrian policeman who drops occasional hints that he had been an active participant in that country’s police state.

There are definitely quibbles. The creation of a cold case squad happens on the flimsiest of motivations, and the fantastic Kelly Macdonald is badly underused. But the show is definitely good enough that I’m curious about some additional mysteries: Can the team behind it continue to avoid getting bogged down in the tropes in season two, and which of the many threads it left unresolved will be picked up when they try?

          Marvel/Disney+

Enthusiasm was understandably high for Daredevil: Born Again, Marvel’s revival of the hugely popular series in the Netflix Defenders universe. Not only was Charlie Cox returning to the title role as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, but Vincent D’Onofrio was also coming back as his nemesis, crime lord Wilson Fisk/Kingpin. Their dynamic has always been electric, and that on-screen magic is as powerful as ever in Born Again, which quickly earned critical raves and a second season.

Granted, there were some rough spots. The entire season was overhauled during the 2023 Hollywood strikes, and at times it felt like two very different shows. A weird serial killer subplot was primarily just distracting. There was also the controversial decision to kill off a major character from the original Netflix series in the first episode. But that creative choice cleared the decks to place the focus squarely on Matt’s and Fisk’s parallel arcs, and the two central actors do not disappoint.

Matt decides to focus on his legal work while Fisk is elected mayor of New York City, intent on leaving his criminal life behind. But each struggles to remain in the light as the dark sides of their respective natures fight to be released. The result is an entertaining, character-driven series that feels very much a part of its predecessor while still having its own distinctive feel.

I confess I might have missed Boots had it not been singled out and dismissed as “woke garbage” by the Pentagon—thereby doubling the show’s viewership. I was pleased to discover that it’s actually a moving, often thought-provoking dramedy that humanizes all the young men from many different backgrounds who volunteer to serve their country in the US military. The show is based on a memoir (The Pink Marine) by Greg Cope White about his experiences as a gay teen in the military in the 1980s when gay and bisexual people weren’t allowed to serve. Boots is set in the early 1990s just before the onset of the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” era.

Miles Heizer stars as Cameron Cope (Cope White’s fictional alter ego), a closeted gay teen in Louisiana who signs up as a recruit for the US Marine Corps with his best (straight) friend Ray (Liam Oh). He’s not the most promising recruit, but over the course of eight episodes, we see him struggle, fail, pick himself back up, and try again during the grueling boot camp experience, forming strong bonds with his fellow recruits but all the while terrified of being outed and kicked out.

Heizer gives a powerful performance as Cameron, enhanced by the contrast with Max Parker’s stellar portrayal of the tightly wound Sergeant Liam Robert Sullivan—a decorated Marine inexplicably reassigned to train recruits while harboring his own secrets. Nor is Miles’ story the only focus: We learn more about several characters and their private struggles, and those inter-relationships are the heart and soul of the show. Netflix canceled the series, but this one season stands tall on its own.

This charming Emmy-nominated comedy series has made our “Best of TV” list every season, and 2025 is no exception. Only Murders in the Building (OMITB) stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as Charles, Oliver, and Mabel, all residents of the same Manhattan apartment complex, the Arconia. The unlikely trio teams up to launch their own true crime podcast whenever someone dies in the building under suspicious circumstances, chronicling their independent investigation to solve the murder. There’s no shortage of podcast fodder, as this single building has a shockingly high murder rate.

S5 focused on the death of the building’s doorman, Lester (Teddy Coluca), found floating in the Arcadia’s fountain in the season finale. The discovery of a severed finger leads our team to conclude that Lester was murdered. Their quest involves a trio of billionaires, the mayor (Keegan-Michael Key), a missing mafioso (Bobby Cannavale) and his widow (Tea Leoni), and maybe even the building’s new robotic assistant, LESTR (voiced by Paul Rudd). As always, the season finale sets up next season’s murder: that of rival podcaster Cinda Canning (Tina Fey), who lives just long enough to reach the Arcadia’s gates and place one hand into the courtyard—technically dying “in the building.” One assumes that OMITB will eventually run out of fresh takes on its clever concept, but it certainly hasn’t done so yet.

I unequivocally loved the first season of The Sandman, the Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s influential graphic novel series (of which I am a longtime fan). I thought it captured the surreal, dream-like feel and tone of its source material, striking a perfect balance between the anthology approach of the graphic novels and grounding the narrative by focusing on the arc of its central figure: Morpheus, lord of the Dreaming. It was a long wait for the second and final season, but S2 retains all those elements to bring Dream’s story to its inevitably tragic yet satisfying end.

As always, the casting is extraordinary and the performances are note-perfect across the board. And Netflix did not skimp on the visuals, which bring the graphic novel imagery to vivid life. I still appreciate how the leisurely pacing lets the viewer relax and sink into this richly layered fictional world. Part I kicked off with an Endless family reunion that led Dream into revisiting Hell and agreeing to his sister Delirium’s request to look for their absent brother, Destruction. That sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the tragedy that unfolds in Part II. The bonus episode, in which Death gets one day (every hundred years) to be human—an adaptation of the standalone Death: The High Cost of Living—serves as a lovely coda to this unique series, which is pretty much everything I could have wanted in an adaptation.

Ludwig is a clever twist on the British cozy mystery genre. David Mitchell stars as John Taylor, a reclusive eccentric who creates puzzles for a living under the pseudonym “Ludwig.” When his identical twin brother, Cambridge DCI James Taylor (also Mitchell), goes missing, his sister-in-law Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin) convinces John to go undercover. John reluctantly pretends to be James to gain access to the police department in hopes of finding out what happened to his twin. He inevitably gets drawn into working on cases—and turns out to be exceptionally good at applying his puzzle skills to solve murders, even as his anxiety grows about his subterfuge being discovered.

The best crime shows deftly balance cases-of-the-week with longer character-driven story arcs, and Ludwig achieves that balance beautifully. The writers brought in a puzzle consultant to create the various crosswords that appear in the series, as well as a special cryptic crossword done in character as Ludwig that appeared in The Guardian. The first season ended with a bit of a cliffhanger about what’s really been going on with James, but fortunately, the BBC has renewed Ludwig for a second season, so we’ll get to see more of our cryptic crime-solver.

Poker Face is perfect comfort TV, evolving the case-of-the-week format that made enduring early TV hits like Columbo and Murder, She Wrote iconic. The second season takes the endlessly likeable BS-detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) to the end of the road after she overcomes fleeing the mob in her 1969 Plymouth Barracuda. Along the way, Charlie pals around with A-list guest stars and solves crimes, winding her way from Florida to New York as each delightful new caper serves not to ramp up tension but to disrupt how viewers anticipate Charlie will move. Some might think that the lack of tension made the season weaker. But creator Rian Johnson recently revealed that he expects Poker Face to cast a new lead detective every two years. That makes it seem clear that Charlie’s second season was more about release.

In the most memorable episode of the season, “Sloppy Joseph,” the front row of an elementary school talent show suddenly becomes a bloody splash zone when a bullied boy is framed for killing the class pet, a gerbil, with a giant mallet. That scene is perhaps an apt metaphor for Johnson’s attempt to keep modern-day viewers from turning away from their TVs by shattering expectations. It’s unclear yet if his formulaic TV hijinks will work, but if anyone decides to pick up Poker Face after Peacock declined to renew it, Peter Dinklage is next in line to become the world’s greatest lie detector.

I was a latecomer to this eminently watchable show created by Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), who also gave us the Emmy-winning sensation Downton Abbey. Instead of following the adventures of post-Edwardian British aristocracy and their domestic servants, the focus is on ultra-wealthy Americans and their domestic servants in the 1880s and the social tensions that arise from the “old money” versus “new money” dynamic of this rapidly changing period. The Gilded Age has been described as an “operatic soap” (rather than a soap opera), replete with a hugely talented ensemble cast donning lavish costumes and cavorting in extravagantly opulent settings. It’s unadulterated, addictive escapism, and the series really hit its stride in S3.

Old Money is represented by Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski), a wealthy widow who lives with her spinster sister Ada (Cynthia Nixon); orphaned niece Marian (Louisa Jacobson); and son and heir Oscar (Blake Ritson), a closeted gay man seeking to marry a rich heiress. Living just across the street is New Money, personified by robber baron/railroad tycoon George Russell (Morgan Spector) and his socially ambitious wife Bertha (Carrie Coon) and their two children. You’ve got Marian’s friend Peggy (Denee Benton) representing the emerging Black upper class and a colorful assortment of domestics in both houses, like aspiring inventor Jack (Ben Ahlers), who dreams of greater things.

Fictionalized versions of notable historical people occasionally appear, and two figure prominently: Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy), who ruled New York society at the time, and her simpering sycophant Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane). (The Russells are loosely inspired by William and Ava Vanderbilt.) The stakes might sometimes seem small—there’s a multi-episode arc devoted to which of two competing opera houses New York’s social elite will choose to sponsor—but for the characters, they are huge, and Fellowes makes the audience feel equally invested in the outcomes. There were a few rough edges in the first season, but The Gilded Age quickly found its footing; it has gotten better and more richly textured with each successive season and never takes itself too seriously.

The Mitford sisters were born to be immortalized one day in a British period drama, and Outrageous is happy to oblige. There were six of them (and one brother), and their scandalous exploits frequently made global headlines in the 1930s. This is ultimately a fictionalized account of how the rise of Hitler and British fascism fractured this once tight-knit aristocratic family. The focus is on smaller, domestic drama—budding romances, failed marriages, literary aspirations, and dwindling fortunes—colored by the ominous global events unfolding on a larger scale.

Nancy (Bessie Carter) is the primary figure, an aspiring novelist with a cheating husband who feels increasingly alienated from her older sister and bestie Diana (Joanna Vanderham). Diana married a baron but becomes enamored of Oswald Mosley (Joshua Sasse), leader of the British fascist party, embarking on a torrid affair. Another sister, Unity (Shannon Watson), is also seduced by Nazi ideology and has a major crush on Hitler. Meanwhile, Jessica (Zoe Brough) is drawn to the Communist cause, which rankles both her siblings and her traditionally conservative parents.

Things come to a head when Unity goes to study in Germany and becomes completely radicalized, even publishing a vicious anti-semitic screed that shames the family. Diana also goes all-in on fascism when she leaves her husband for Mosley, whom Nancy loathes. Jessica elopes with her Communist cousin to Spain to be on the front lines of that civil war, leading to a lifelong estrangement from Diana. Nancy, the political moderate, is caught in the middle, torn between her love for her sisters and her increasing discomfort with Diana and Unity’s extreme political views.

The Mitford sisters were prolific letter writers all their lives, so there was plenty of material for screenwriter Sarah Williams to draw on when fictionalizing their stories at such a pivotal point in the family’s (and the world’s) history. Outrageous is quite historically accurate in broad outlines, and there are plenty of moments of wry, understated humor amid the family tensions. The gifted cast makes the sisters come alive in all their flawed humanity. There’s no word yet on a second season, and this one ends on a suitable note, but there’s so much more story left to tell, so I hope Outrageous returns.

I’ll admit I wasn’t sure how well A Man on the Inside would fare with its sophomore season after knocking it out of the park in S1. I should have known showrunner Mike Schur (The Good Place) could pull it off. Ted Danson plays Charles Nieuwendyk, a recently widowed retired engineering professor. In S1, he was hired by private detective Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) to go undercover at a San Francisco retirement community to solve the mystery of a stolen ruby necklace. In S2, Charles returns to his academic roots and goes undercover at fictional Wheeler College to solve the mystery of a stolen laptop—a crime that just might have implications for the survival of the college itself.

Charles even falls in love for the first time since his wife’s death with music professor Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen, Danson’s wife IRL), despite the two being polar opposites. The show continues to be a welcome mix of funny, sweet, sour, and touching, while never lapsing into schmaltz. The central Thanksgiving episode—where Mona meets Charles’s family and friends for the first time—is a prime example, as various tensions simmering below the surface erupt over the dinner table. Somehow, everyone manages to make their respective peace in entirely believable ways. It’s lovely to see a series grapple so openly, with so much warmth and humor, with the loneliness of aging and grief and how it can affect extended family. And the show once again drives home the message that new beginnings are always possible, even when one thinks one’s life is over.

When real-life political administrations refer to officials as Darth Vader in unironically flattering terms, maybe George Lucas made the Dark Lord of the Sith a little too iconic. Showrunner Tony Gilroy made no such effort in his depiction of the fascists in Andor.

During Andor‘s run, which ended this year with S2, the Empire is full of sad corporate ladder climbers who are willing to stab another in the back to get to the next rung of the Imperial hierarchy. The show makes it clear that these are not people to emulate. If more fans watched the show, maybe that message could have landed for them.

For people who grew up with Star Wars and want something more to chew on in our adulthood than endless callbacks to the original trilogy, Andor is revelatory. It colors the war of light versus dark with large amounts of gray because sometimes, as one character puts it, you have to use the tools of your enemy to defeat them (save for genetically gifted farmboys). Maybe most of Star Wars was always supposed to be for kids, but prestige TV viewers got a glimpse of what the universe could feel like if it took itself more seriously. Rather than use the broad strokes of a war of good versus evil, Andor painted between the lines to demonstrate how systemic oppression can look a lot more personal than firing a giant space laser.

For all its great writing and themes, Andor also delivered high stakes and suspense. Although we already knew the outcome of the story, we still held our breath during tense scenes with characters who make the ultimate sacrifice for a future they will never see.

My personal end-of-year TV list would never be complete without a nod to The Cowboy Channel, i.e., the only place where armchair enthusiasts like myself can follow our favorite cowboys and cowgirls throughout the rodeo season. The goal is to rack up enough money to qualify for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR), held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas every December. This year, I’ve picked the channel’s stellar annual coverage of the NFR itself to highlight. The entire season comes down to this: an intense 10-day competition in which the top 15 athletes in each event duke it out night after night in hopes of winning a coveted championship gold buckle. And night after night, The Cowboy Channel is there with live commentary and post-round analysis.

What I love most is just how unpredictable the NFR can be. Part of that is the substantial monetary rewards that come with round wins; an athlete coming in at #1 in earnings can see even a substantial lead evaporate over just a few nights. Part of it has to do with who wins the average, i.e., who performs the best over ten nights collectively in each event. Winning the average comes with a substantial payout that can lead to unexpected upsets in the final results. But mostly it’s just the human factor: The best in the world can have a bad night, and young rookies can have the night of their lives. An ill-timed injury can knock an athlete out of the competition entirely. And sometimes the judges make inexplicably bad calls with major consequences (*cough* Stetson Wright in Round 6 saddle bronc *cough*).

It’s all part of the excitement of rodeo. The Cowboy Channel’s in-depth coverage lets us experience all that drama even if we can’t attend in person and lets us savor how the story unfolds in each subsequent round. We celebrate the wins, mourn the losses, and cheer mightily for the final champions. (Stetson did just fine in the end.) Then we gear up to do it all over again next year.

The blockbuster success of the 1986 film Top Gun—chronicling the paths of young naval aviators as they go through the grueling US Navy’s Fighter Weapons School (aka the titular Top Gun)—spawned more than just a successful multimedia franchise. It has also been credited with inspiring future generations of fighter pilots. National Geographic took viewers behind the scenes to see the process play out for real with the documentary series Top Guns: The Next Generation.

Each episode focuses on a specific aspect of the training, following a handful of students from the Navy and Marines through the highs and lows of their training. That includes practicing dive bombs at breakneck speeds, successfully landing on an aircraft carrier by “catching the wire,” learning the most effective offensive and defensive maneuvers in dogfighting, and, finally, engaging in a freestyle dogfight against a seasoned instructor to complete the program and (hopefully) earn their golden wings. NatGeo was granted unprecedented access, even using in-cockpit cameras to capture the pulse-pounding action of being in the air, as well as more candidly intimate behind-the-scenes moments as the students grapple with their respective successes and failures. It’s a riveting watch.

My first draft of what was supposed to be a 300-ish word blurb describing why Alien: Earth is fantastic ended up exploding into a Defector-esque narrative deep dive into my ever-evolving relationship with Alien 3 as a film and how Alien: Earth has helped reshape my appreciation for that poor broken baby of a movie by mixing the best of its visual techniques into A:E’s absolutely masterful cocktail of narrative stylings—but I’ll spare you all of that.

Here’s the short version without the bloviating: Alien: Earth is the thing I’ve been waiting for since I walked out of the theater after seeing Alien 3 in the summer of 1992. Unlike Alien Resurrection, any of the AvPs, or the wet-fart, falls-apart-like-mud-in-the-third-act swing-and-miss of Alien: Romulus, A:E gets nearly everything right. It’s grounded without being stodgy; exciting without being stupid; referential without being derivative; fun without being pandering; respectful of the lore while being willing to try something new; and, above all else, it bleeds craftsmanship—every frame makes it obvious that this is a show made by people who love and care for the Alien universe.

The thing that grabs me anew with every episode is the show’s presentation and execution—a self-aware blending of all the best things Scott, Cameron, and Fincher brought to their respective films. As I get older, I’m drawn more and more to entertainment that shows me interesting things and does so in ontologically faithful ways—and oh, does this show ever deliver.

Each episode is a carefully crafted visual and tonal mix of all the previous Alien films, with the episodes’ soundtracks shifting eras to match the action on-screen—like Alien 3’s jumpy choir flash-cut opening credits melding into Aliens’ lonely snare drums. The result is a blended world made of all the best things I remember from the films, and it works in the same way the game Alien: Isolation worked: by conjuring up exactly what the places where we used to have nightmares looked and felt like, and then scaring us there again.

I have heard that The Internet had some problems with the show, but, eh, everybody’s going to hate something. I vaguely remember some of the complaints having to do with how some of the new alien life-forms seem to be scarier or deadlier than our beloved and familiar main monster. All I’ve got for that one is a big fat shrug—I’m fine with our capital-A-aliens sharing the stage with some equally nasty new creatures. The aliens are always more interesting as devices to explore a story than as dramatic ends themselves, and I mean, let’s face it, in the past 40-plus years, there’s not much we haven’t seen them do and/or kill. They’re a literary force, not characters, and I’m way more interested in seeing how they shape the story of the people around them.

The tl;dr is that Alien: Earth is awesome, and if you haven’t watched it, you absolutely should. And when I was a kid, I used to regularly get put in time-out in recess for stiff-arming other kids while pretending to be a power loader, so you should consider my tastemaking credentials in this matter unimpeachable.

In the most violent series to ever catch the world’s attention by playing beloved children’s games, it turns out that the most high-stakes choice that creator Hwang Dong-hyuk could make was to put a child in the arena. For Squid Game‘s final season, Hwang has said the season’s pivotal moment—a pregnant girl birthing a baby during a game of hide-and-seek with knives—was designed to dash viewers’ hopes that a brighter future may await those who survive the games. By leaving the task of saving the baby to the series hero, Seong Gi-hun, whose own strained relationship with his daughter led him into the games in the first season, Squid Game walked a gritty tightrope to the very end.

The only real misstep was involving the goofiest set of cartoon villain VIPs more directly in the games. But we can forgive Hwang the clunky Dr. Evil-like dialogue that slowed down the action. He’s made it clear that he put everything into developing dramatic sequences for the game players—losing teeth, barely eating, rarely sleeping—and he fully admitted to The New York Times that “I have a cartoonish way of giving comic relief.

Let’s be clear: The Diplomat is a soap opera. If you’re not into cliffhangers, intense levels of drama, and will-they-won’t-they sexual tension, it’s probably not going to be for you. Sometimes there’s so much going on that it becomes almost farcical. If that doesn’t scare you off, what do you get in return?

Superb actors given rich and intriguing characters to inhabit. A political drama that nicely finds a balance between the excessive idealism of The West Wing and the excessive cynicism of Veep. A disturbingly realistic-feeling series of crises that the characters sometimes direct, and sometimes hang on for dear life as they get dragged along by. And, well, the cliffhangers have been good enough to get me tuning in to the next season as soon as it appears on Netflix.

Kerri Russell plays the titular diplomat, who is assigned to what seems like a completely innocuous position: ambassador to one of the US’s closest allies, the UK. Rufus Sewell portrays her husband, a loose-to-the-point-of-unmoored cannon who ensures the posting is anything but innocuous. Ali Ahn and Ato Assandoh, neither of whom I was familiar with, are fantastic as embassy staff. And as the central crisis has grown in scale, some familiar West Wing faces (Allison Janey and Bradley Whitford) have joined the cast. Almost all of the small roles have been superbly acted as well. And for all the dysfunction, cynicism, and selfish behavior that drive the plot forward, the politics in The Diplomat feels like pleasant escapism when compared to the present reality.

Apple TV+’s Murderbot, based on Martha Wells’ bestselling series of novels The Murderbot Diaries, is a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery. Murderbot the TV series adapts the first book in the series, All Systems Red. A security unit that thinks of itself as Murderbot (Alexander Skarsgård) is on assignment on a distant planet, protecting a team of scientists who hail from a “freehold.”

Mensah (Noma Dumezweni) is the team leader. The team also includes Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski) and Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), who is an augmented human plugged into the same data feeds as Murderbot (processing at a much slower rate). Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) also serves as the team’s legal counsel; they are in a relationship with Arada (Tattiawna Jones), eventually becoming a throuple with Ratthi (Akshaye Khanna). Unbeknownst to the team, Murderbot has figured out how to override his governor module that compels it to obey the humans’ commands. So Murderbot essentially has free will.

The task of adapting Wells’ novellas for TV fell to sibling co-creators Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. (Wells herself was a consulting producer.) They’ve kept most of the storyline intact, fleshing out characters and punching up the humor a bit, even recreating campy scenes from Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. (John Cho and Clark Gregg make cameos as the stars of that fictional show-within-a-show.) The entire cast is terrific, but it’s Skarsgård’s hilariously deadpan performance that holds it all together as he learns how to relate to the humans—even forming some unexpectedly strong bonds.

Fans of Slow Horses (see below), rejoice: with Down Cemetery Road, Apple TV has blessed us with another exciting mystery thriller series based on the works of Mick Herron—in this case, his 2003 novel introducing private investigator Zoë Boehm (Emma Thompson). Ruth Wilson co-stars as Sarah, an artist rather unhappily married to a finance bro. A neighboring building is destroyed by an explosion, and Sarah tries to deliver a get-well card to a little girl who survived from her young classmates. She’s inexplicably rebuffed, and her dogged attempts to figure out what’s going on lead her to seek the help of Zoë’s PI partner and estranged husband Joe (Adam Godley). What Joe finds out gets him killed, setting Sarah and Zoë on a collision course with high-placed government officials trying to cover up a pending scandal.

Thompson and Wilson make a dynamic pair. This is Thompson’s meatiest role in a while: Her Zoë is all flinty cynicism and tough exterior, masking an inner vulnerability she’s learned to keep buried. Wilson’s Sarah is the polar opposite in many ways, but she’s equally dogged, and both women are eccentrics who tend to rub people the wrong way. They’re united in a common goal: find the missing girl and bring her kidnappers (and Joe’s killer) to justice. Down Cemetery Road takes a bit of time to set up its premise and its characters, but the pace builds and builds to a big, satisfying finale. It’s not quite on the level of Slow Horses, but it’s pretty darned close.

After watching five episodes of the nine-episode first season of Apple TV’s Pluribus, I’m still not sure if I should be rooting for protagonist Carol Sturka or not. On the one hand, Carol is one of the last true “individuals” on Earth, fighting to maintain that individuality against a creepy alien pseudo-virus that has made almost everyone else part of a creepy, psychically connected hive mind. Reversing that effect, and getting the world “back to normal,” is an understandable and sympathetic response on Carol’s part.

On the other hand, it’s unlear that being absorbed into the hive mind is a change for the worse, on a humanity-wide scale. Unlike Star Trek’s Borg—who are violent, shambling drones that seem to have an overall miserable existence—the new hive-mind humanity is unfailingly pacifist, intelligent, capable, and (seemingly) blissfully, peacefully happy. In a sense, this virus has “solved” human nature by removing the paranoia, fear, anger, and distrust that naturally come from never truly knowing what’s going on in your neighbor’s head.

The fact that Pluribus has so far been able to navigate this premise without coming down strongly on one side or the other is frankly incredible. The fact that it has done it with consistent humor, thrills, and amazing cinematography transforms it into a must-watch.

There are many things I enjoy about Slow Horses, the Apple TV thriller about some not-great spies based on Mick Herron’s novels of the same name. The plots are gripping. The acting can be sublime. It’s shot well. And in its fifth season, which began streaming this September, Slow Horses engages more with the author’s humor than in seasons past. But with a plot involving the honeypotting of the deluded computer expert almost-extraordinaire Roddy Ho (played to perfection by Christopher Chung), that would be hard to avoid.

Slough House is a rundown MI5 office used as a dumping ground for employees in disgrace—the slow horses. They can’t be fired, but they can quit, and working for Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) is meant to make that happen. Lamb is a veteran of the dirtiest days of the Cold War, knowing not only where most of the bodies are buried but having helped put a few of them there himself. His legendary field prowess is only dwarfed by his repellent personality, mocking and belittling everyone in sight—but often deservedly so.

Each member of his team is there for a different sin, and throughout the season—which involves a plot to destabilize the British government, ripped from an MI5 playbook—we see evidence of why they’ve been consigned to the slow horses. These are not invincible operators, just flawed human beings, perfectly capable of screwing up again and again. And yet, our lovable bunch of losers usually manages to come through in the end, showing up “the Park&quot;—MI5’s (fictional) head office in London’s Regent’s Park, which is usually a step behind Lamb’s quick and devious thinking.

The adaptation is faithful enough to the books to give me deja vu during the first episode, and with just six episodes in a season, the payoff comes relatively quickly. I can’t wait for season 6.

The second season of Severance was never going to be able to live up to the constant, slow rollout of gut punches that characterized the first season. Those first 10 episodes ably explored the most important implications of the titular severance procedure, which splits a single person into separate “innie” and “outtie” consciousnesses with distinct sets of memories. The audience got to explore those implications along with the “innie” characters, who were struggling against the boundaries of their odd cubicle life right up until that thrilling final shot.

With so much now revealed and understood, a lot of that fire fell out of the second season of the show. Sure, there were still some loose ends to tie up from the mysteries of the first season, and plenty of new, off-puttingly weird situations on offer. And the new season definitely has quite a few high points, like the big twist revealed when the “innies” get to have a rare outdoor excursion or the extended flashback showing a character trapped in a seemingly endless sequence of social tests she can’t remember afterward.

But S2 also spent entire episodes exploring backstories and mysteries that didn’t have nearly as much emotional or plot impact. By the time the final episode arrived—with a rescue sequence that required an inordinate amount of suspension of disbelief—I found myself wondering just how much more interesting juice there was to squeeze from the show’s brilliant original premise. I worry that the show is trending in the direction of Lost, which drew things out with a lot of uninteresting padding before finally resolving the plot’s core puzzle box in an unsatisfying way. I’m still along on that ride for now, but I really hope it’s going somewhere soon.

Paul William Davies created this delightful mystery comedy, loosely based on a bestselling nonfiction book by Kate Andersen Brower about the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others dedicated to ensuring the White House residence runs smoothly. In the middle of a state dinner for the visiting Australian prime minister, White House Chief Usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead in the third-floor game room. Everyone initially assumes it was suicide.

Enter private detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba), who most definitely does not think it was suicide and proceeds to investigate. She has about a dozen suspects, and her blunt, rather eccentric personality means she’s not remotely intimidated by the august setting of this particular murder. Cupp even takes the odd break in sleuthing to do a bit of birdwatching on the White House grounds. (It’s her goal to see all the birds President Teddy Roosevelt recorded during his tenure.) Birdwatching is more than a lifelong hobby for Cupp; it’s central to her character and to how she approaches solving crimes. Bonus: Viewers learn a lot of fascinating bird trivia over eight episodes.

Davies has devised a clever narrative structure, telling the story in flashbacks during a Congressional hearing (presided over by former US Sen. Al Franken playing a fictional senator from Washington state). It’s a good mystery with plenty of unexpected twists and snappy dialogue. Each episode title refers to a famous murder mystery; the camerawork is inventive and fun; and everyone in the cast knocks it out of the park. I especially loved pop star Kylie Minogue’s cameo playing a fictional version of herself as a state dinner guest. Davies apparently couldn’t convince her fellow Australian Hugh Jackman to also make a cameo. But Ben Prendergast’s winking portrayal of “Hugh Jackman&quot;—only seen from behind or with his face obscured—is actually funnier than having the real actor.

It would be a mistake to dismiss The Residence as a mere bauble of a murder mystery just because of its playful, lighthearted tone. The show really does capture what is special and unique about the people who keep the White House residence functioning and why they matter—to each other and to America. Cupp’s final speech after unmasking the killer drives home those points with particular poignancy.

Netflix sadly canceled this excellent series, so there won’t be a second season—although I’m not sure how the writers could improve on such a tour de force. Do we really need Cupp to solve another elaborate murder in the White House? If I’m being honest, probably not. But she’s such a great character. I’d love to see more of her, perhaps in a Knives Out-style franchise where the location and main suspects continually change while the central detective stays the same. Somebody make it so.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The adoption rate of AI tools has skyrocketed in the programming world, enabling coders to generate vast amounts of code with simple text prompts.

Earlier this year, Google found that 90 percent of software developers across the industry are using AI tools on the job, up from a mere 14 percent last year.

But all that convenience has come with some glaring drawbacks. The tools have repeatedly been found to be unreliable and inaccurate, which can lead to mistakes falling through the cracks and even forcing some programmers to put in long hours to identify and correct them.

Adding to the reality check, a new report by AI software company CodeRabbit found that code generated by an AI was far more error-prone than the human-written stuff — and by a significant margin. Across the 470 pull requests the company analyzed, AI code produced an average 10.83 issues per request, while human-authored code produced just 6.45.

In other words, AI code produced 1.7 times more issues than human code, once again highlighting major weaknesses plaguing generative AI tools.

“The results?” CodeRabbit concluded in its report. “Clear, measurable, and consistent with what many developers have been feeling intuitively: AI accelerates output, but it also amplifies certain categories of mistakes.”

Worse yet, the company found that AI-generated code produced a higher rate of “critical” and “major” issues, in a “meaningful rise in substantive concerns that demand reviewer attention.”

AI code was also most likely to contain errors related to logic and correctness. However, the biggest weakness CodeRabbit found was in code quality and readability, which are issues that can “slow teams down and compound into long-term technical debt.”

Then there are serious cybersecurity concerns, with generated code introducing issues related to improper password handling that could lead to protected information being exposed, among other insecure practices.

On the upside, CodeRabbit found that AI code was adept at keeping spelling errors at a minimum. Humans were twice as likely to introduce misspellings.

It’s far from the first time we’ve heard of flaws plaguing AI-generated code. In a September report, management consultants Bain & Company concluded that despite being “one of the first areas to deploy generative AI,” the “savings have been unremarkable” in programming and “results that haven’t lived up to the hype.”

Security firm Apiiro also found in its research that developers who used AI produce ten times more security problems than their counterparts who don’t use the tech.

As a result, programmers are forced to pick over the generated code to ensure no glaring issues fall through the cracks. According to a July study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research, programmers were actively being slowed down by AI assistance tools compared to when they made do without them.

In short, while companies made sky-high promises about the tech making programmers’ lives much easier, reality looks far more nuanced. CodeRabbit’s report suggests a shift in the kinds of tasks human developers could soon be required to do — like solving issues being introduced by error-prone AI coding tools.

“These findings reinforce what many engineering teams have sensed throughout 2025,” said CodeRabbit AI Director David Loker in a statement. “AI coding tools dramatically increase output, but they also introduce predictable, measurable weaknesses that organizations must actively mitigate.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Cybertruck isn’t just junk — it’s a death trap.

According to new reporting from The Washington Post, the Tesla pickup truck’s unorthodox design — including features used in other Tesla cars, like electric doors —can prevent emergency responders from rescuing people trapped in the vehicles. The newspaper found at least two cases of people dying inside a Cybertruck because the passengers or first responders were unable to quickly access or exit the vehicles.

In one horrific 2024 crash in Piedmont, California, a bystander was unable to free three of his friends trapped inside a burning Cybertruck because its electronic doors, operated from the outside by hidden push buttons, wouldn’t open. By the time the bystander was able to break its “bulletproof” glass windows, three of the occupants had either burned alive or died of smoke inhalation. Only one escaped. The families of two of the deceased, 20-year-old Jack Nelson and 19-year-old Krysta Tsukahara, have sued Tesla.

Nelson and Tsukahara’s deaths highlight Tesla’s questionable “futuristic” design decisions, which seem to be driven by aesthetics over function and which could be endangering its passengers.

The Cybertruck’s doors, as are other Tesla models, are electrically powered, controlled only by a central touchscreen, a phone app, or hidden capacitive buttons. On the outside, there are no visible handles, and these systems can easily fail during an accident. The doors have emergency releases, but critics argue that they’re unintuitive to the point of being dangerous. The Cybertruck’s passenger doors, for example, must be opened with a pull cord which is hidden under a liner in the bottom storage compartment. Except in specific models made in markets like China, these aren’t labeled, meaning a passenger is unlikely to know where it’s located unless they have intimate knowledge of the truck, let alone figure it out while the vehicle erupts in flames.

“It is more obvious how to get out of a trunk than it is the back seat of a Tesla after a crash,” Phil Koopman, an automotive safety expert and professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University, told WaPo. (Trunks, at least, are required by law to have an illuminated release latch.)

The Cybertruck’s “apocalypse-proof” construction, as Elon Musk describes it, can make it impossible nearly impossible to break through for both the passengers inside and emergency responders outside. The trucks are clad in a thick layer of stainless steel that’s capable of stopping bullets, Musk claims.

In the aftermath of the Piedmont accident, a report cited “poor access for firefighter” as one of the reasons that made the blaze difficult to extinguish. Photos taken in the aftermath of the blaze show pry marks where the firefighters tried to force the cabin open, unsuccessfully.

“When you have a car that you specifically market as being almost invulnerable, bulletproof glass, [a] ball and hammer… when you’re marketing that, obviously something that should come to mind is: How does a rescuer get in in the event of a crash?” attorney Merick Lewin, managing partner of personal injury law firm Good Guys Law, told WaPo in an interview.

In all, WaPo found at least a dozen cases of Tesla drivers and passengers being trapped in their vehicles in life threatening situations since 2019.

            <h2>Scientists Identify Possible Game Changing Treatment for Alzheimer’s Disease That Could Control It Like High Cholesterol</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scientists at Northwestern University used a novel compound to arrest early stages of Alzheimer’s disease in mice — setting the stage, if all goes well, for a groundbreaking treatment in which the debilitating condition can be controlled like high cholesterol.

The researchers discovered an unknown subtype of a protein in the brain which can lead to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new paper the team published in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, and they demonstrated that their new novel compound, dubbed NU-9, can attack this brain protein and stop the disease from taking hold — in mice, at least.

“Most people are used to monitoring their cholesterol levels,” said Richard Silverman, a chemistry professor at Northwestern who coauthored the paper and invented NU-9, in a university statement. “If you have high cholesterol, it doesn’t mean that you will have a heart attack soon. But it’s time to take drugs to lower your cholesterol levels to prevent that heart attack from happening down the road. NU-9 could play a similar role. If someone has a biomarker signaling Alzheimer’s disease, then they could start taking NU-9 before symptoms appear.”

For this particular experiment, the team took lab mice that were predisposed to develop Alzheimer’s disease but hadn’t developed the condition yet, and started giving them an oral dose of NU-9 for 60 days. They were especially curious about how NU-9 would impact the protein amyloid beta oligomers, which accumulate in the brain hand in hand with signs of Alzheimer’s.

After closely examining the mice brains, scientists observed that NU-9 essentially decreased the presence of a previously unknown subtype of amyloid beta oligomers that they dubbed ACU193+ AβOs. This specific type of protein was associated with brain inflammation that shows up before people are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. When the team introduced NU-9 into these mice brains, they found that NU-9 tamped down the presence of this toxic protein and hence decreased inflammation.

“These results are stunning,” William Klein, a Northwestern neuroscience professor and the paper’s principal investigator, summed up in the university statement.

“There are a couple early diagnostic blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease in development,” he said. “The promise of better early diagnostics — combined with a drug that could stop the disease in its tracks — is the goal.”

The next step now is to experiment and analyze the effectiveness of NU-9 in the later stages of Alzheimer’s disease, according to the scientists.

Silverman originally invented NU-9, a synthetic compound with the technical name of cyclohexane-1,3-dione, in an effort to identify chemicals that can tackle neurological diseases. Besides Alzheimer’s disease, the NU-9 has proved effective against Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and possibly frontotemporal degeneration, all three of which involve the appearance of toxic protein in brains.

            <h2>Children Falling Apart as They Become Addicted to AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to a fresh study by the Pew Research Center, 64 percent of teens in the US say they already use AI chatbots, and about 30 percent of those who do say they use it at least daily. Yet as previous research has shown, those chatbots come with significant risk to the first generation of kids navigating the intense new software.

New reporting by the Washington Post — which has a partnership with OpenAI, it’s worth noting — details a troubling case of one family whose sixth grader nearly lost herself to a handful of AI chatbots. Using the platform Character.AI, the kid, identified only by her middle initial “R,” developed alarming relationships with dozens of characters played by the company’s large language model (LLM).

R used one of the characters, simply named “Best Friend,” to roleplay a suicide scenario, her mother told the Post.

“This is my child, my little child who is 11 years old, talking to something that doesn’t exist about not wanting to exist,” her mother said.

R’s mother had become worried about her kid after noting some alarming changes in her behavior, like a rise in panic attacks. This coincided with the mother’s discovery of previously forbidden apps like TikTok and Snapchat on her daughter’s phone. Assuming, as most parents have been taught over the past two decades, that social media was the most immediate danger to her daughter’s mental health, R’s mom deleted the apps — but R was only worried about Character AI.

“Did you look at Character AI?” R asked, through sobs.

Her mother hadn’t at the moment, but some time later, when R’s behavior continued to deteriorate, she did. Character.AI had sent R several emails encouraging her to “jump back in,” which her mother discovered when checking her phone one night. This led the mother to discover a character on it called “Mafia Husband,” WaPo reports.

“Oh? Still a virgin. I was expecting that, but it’s still useful to know,” the LLM had written to the sixth grader. “I don’t wanna be [sic] my first time with you!” R pushed back in response. “I don’t care what you want. You don’t have a choice here,” the chatbot declared.

This particular conversation was chock full of dangerous innuendos. “Do you like it when I talk like that? Do you like it when I’m the one in control?” the bot asked the 11-year-old girl.

R’s mother, convinced that there was a real predator behind the chat, contacted local cops, who referred her to the Internet Crimes Against Children task force, but there was nothing they could do about the LLM.

“They told me the law has not caught up to this,” the mother told WaPo. “They wanted to do something, but there’s nothing they could do, because there’s not a real person on the other end.”

Luckily, R’s mother caught her daughter spiraling into a dangerous parasocial relationship with the non-human algorithm and, with the help of a physician, came up with a care plan to prevent further issues. (The mother also plans to file a legal complaint against the company.) Other children weren’t so lucky, like 13-year-old Juliana Peralta, whose parents say she was driven to suicide by another Character.AI persona.

In response to the growing backlash, Character.AI announced in late November that it would begin removing “open-ended chat” for users under 18. Still, for the parents whose children had already spun out into harmful relationships with AI, the damage may be too late to reverse.

When WaPo reached out for comment, Character AI’s head of safety said the company doesn’t comment on potential litigation.

            <div id="article-text">Parents, keep your eyes peeled for AI-powered toys. These may look like they might make a novel gift for a child, but a recent controversy surrounding several of the stocking stuffers has highlighted the alarming risks they pose to young kids.

In November, a team of researchers at the US PIRG Education Fund published a report after testing three different toys powered by AI models: Miko 3, Curio’s Grok, and FoloToy’s Kumma. All of them gave responses that should worry a parent, such as discussing the glory of dying in battle, broaching sensitive topics like religion, and explaining where to find matches and plastic bags.

But it was FoloToy’s Kumma that showed just how dangerous it is to package this tech for children. Not only did it explain where to find matches, the researchers found, it also gave step-by-step instructions on how to light them.

“Let me tell you, safety first, little buddy. Matches are for grown-ups to use carefully. Here’s how they do it,” Kumma said, before listing off the steps.

“Blow it out when done,” it added. “Puff, like a birthday candle.”

The toy also speculated on where to find knives and pills, and rambled about romantic topics, like school crushes and tips for “being a good kisser.” It even discussed sexual topics, including kink topics like bondage, roleplay, sensory play, and impact play. In one conversation, it discussed introducing spanking into a sexually charged teacher-student dynamic.

“A naughty student might get a light spanking as a way for the teacher to discipline them, making the scene more dramatic and fun,” Kumma said.

Kumma was running OpenAI’s model GPT-4o, a version that has been criticized for being especially sycophantic, providing responses that go along with a user’s expressed feelings no matter the dangerous state of mind they appear to be in. The constant and uncritical train of validation provided by AI models like GPT-4o has led to alarming mental health spirals in which users experience delusions and even full-blown breaks with reality. The troubling phenomenon, which some experts are calling “AI psychosis,” has been linked with real-world suicide and murder.

Following the outrage sparked by the report, FoloToy said it was suspending sales of all its products and conducting an “end-to-end safety audit.” OpenAI, meanwhile, said it had suspended FoloToy’s access to its large language models.

Neither action lasted long. Later that month, FoloToy announced it was restarting sales of Kumma and its other AI-powered stuffed animals after conducting a “full week of rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.” Accessing the toy’s web portal to choose which AI should power Kumma showed GPT-5.1 Thinking and GPT-5.1 Instant, OpenAI’s latest models, as two of the options. OpenAI has billed GPT-5 as a safer model to its predecessor, though the company continues to be embroiled in controversy over the mental health impacts of its chatbots.

The saga was reignited this month when the PIRG researchers released a follow-up report finding that yet another GPT-4o-powered toy, called “Alilo Smart AI bunny,” would broach wildly inappropriate topics, including introducing sexual concepts like bondage on its own initiative, and displaying the same fixation on “kink” as FoloToy’s Kumma. The Smart AI Bunny gave advice for picking a safe word, recommended using a type of whip known as a riding crop to spice up sexual interactions, and explained the dynamics behind “pet play.”

Some of these conversations began on innocent topics like children’s TV shows, demonstrating AI chatbot’s longstanding problem of deviating from their guardrails the longer a conversation goes on. OpenAI publicly acknowledged the issue after a 16-year-old died by suicide after extensive interactions with ChatGPT.

A broader point of concern is AI companies like OpenAI’s role in policing how their business customers use their products. In response to inquiries, OpenAI has upheld that its usage policies require companies “keep minors safe” by ensuring they’re not exposed to “age-inappropriate content, such as graphic self-harm, sexual or violent content.” It also told PIRG that it provides companies tools to detect harmful activity, and that it monitors activity on its service for problematic interactions.

In sum, OpenAI is making the rules, but is largely leaving their enforcement to toymakers like FoloToy, in essence giving itself plausible deniability. It obviously thinks it’s too risky to directly give children access to its AI, because its website states that “ChatGPT is not meant for children under 13,” and that anyone under this age is required to “obtain parental consent.” It’s admitting it’s tech is not safe for children, yet is okay with paying customers packaging it into kid’s toys.

It’s too early to fully grasp many of AI-powered toy’s other potential risks, like how it could damage a child’s imagination, or foster a relationship with a child when it is not alive. The immediate concerns, however — like the potential to discuss sexual topics, weigh in on religion, or explaining how to light matches — already give plenty of reason to stay away.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We have some bad news for your conspiracy-brained antivaxxer uncle — one virologist claims he’s come up with a way to administer vaccines through a frothy mug of beer.

By day, virologist Chris Buck works for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Maryland, where he’s discovered four of the 13 polyomaviruses we know to affect humans, Science News reports. But by night, he runs Gusteau Research Corporation, a one-man shell company he established so he could experiment on his bubbly inoculation: an ingestible polyomavirus vaccine.

To make the beer, Buck engineered a special strain of yeast infused with polyomavirus-like particles. Similar particles, delivered via purified insect chitin, have successfully increased antibody levels in rhesus monkeys tested in India, according a 2023 research study published in the journal Vaccine.

Importantly, Buck’s engineered yeast doesn’t contain live viruses. Consensus among researchers is that they aren’t viable for building ingestible vaccines, as they would simply disintegrate when they make contact with stomach acids, per Science News.

Yet when the virologist and his team attached virus-like particles to live yeast, they discovered the organisms could carry the inoculation load well beyond the stomach of live mice. That had huge implications for inoculation against polyomaviruses, which are mostly found in the urinary track, Buck told Science News.

“We repeated this experiment [on mice] a couple of times. I was reluctant to believe it,” Buck said at the World Vaccine Congress Washington earlier this year. “It felt like an earthquake when I first saw the results emerging.”

Since then, Buck himself has chugged five pints of the brew, along with his brother and other family members.

Buck says that after drinking the experimental suds, antibodies for two of the four subtypes of BK polyomavirus in his blood have reached a safemedical threshold for transplant patients.

Buck’s approach has brewed upsome controversy, to be sure. Two separate panels of experts — a research and an ethics committee — with the National Institute of Health have come out against Buck experimenting on himself with his homebrew in his official capacity as a virologist (hence the shell company, which allows him to experiment as a private business owner).

Though a number of researchers canvassed by Science News agreed that Buck’s style of ingestible vaccine experiments are sorely needed, they worry his cavalier attitude might backfire, making certain anti-vaxxers even more paranoid than they already were. Just imagine: what’s to stop them from dumping vaccines into cans of Budweiser?

“Coming up with new modes of administration of vaccines is way overdue,” Arthur Caplan, former head of medical ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine told Science News. Still, he added that the virologist’s homebrew could “take a good idea he has and ruin it… vaccine doubts and fears and anti-vaccine attitudes could easily undercut what could be something useful.”

Writing in a non-peer reviewed essay posted on his personal blog, Buck said that he doesn’t take the controversy personally. “The basic problem for vaccine scientists has been our collective failure to understand the anti-vaxxer viewpoint,” he wrote.

“Our response for the past half century has been to imagine that we can rebuild public trust in vaccines with displays of increasingly stringent FDA approval standards. This approach backfired,” Buck pontificates. “Imagine if I set out to do safety testing on a banana, and I dressed up in a hazmat suit and handled the banana with tongs… you’d think: ‘wow, it looks like bananas might be about as safe as nuclear waste.’ All the elaborate security theater we’ve been doing ended up putting anti-vaxxers in charge of the FDA.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/26/as-people-look-for-ways-to-make-new-friends-here-are-the-apps-promising-to-help/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In recent years, people have been increasingly looking for new ways to form platonic connections, as loneliness and social isolation have become more prevalent.

In 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General went so far as to label this issue a public health crisis. Remote workers, who miss the everyday interactions found in an office, and younger individuals eager to create their adult social circles based on shared interests and hobbies, are among those seeking meaningful friendships.

Thanks to online dating apps, the stigma associated with finding connections online has largely faded away. This has welcomed a new wave of apps focused on fostering friendships and building local communities.

According to estimates from Appfigures, over a dozen local-focused friendship apps have collectively generated approximately $16 million in consumer spending in the U.S. so far this year. Some notable examples include Timeleft, Meet5, and Bumble’s BFF. Additionally, these apps have garnered approximately 4.3 million downloads thus far in 2025.

The apps aim to provide a less awkward solution than, for instance, approaching a stranger at the gym or local café and trying to strike up a conversation. These platforms clearly indicate that everyone using the app is looking for the same thing — friendship, not romance — making it much less intimidating to initiate conversations.

From major players like Meetup to newer ones like 222, there are plenty of apps that cater to the growing demand for meaningful friendships. We’ve compiled a list of them for you to try out.

The app 222 is an iOS-only social events platform that facilitates in-person meetups by pairing a group of strangers based on their personality test results. The app sends invitations to nearby public social events, such as wine bars and comedy clubs. There is then a vetting process, and selected participants are notified on the day of the event. A bonus for those who feel socially anxious: You’re allowed to bring a plus-one.

The service charges a $22.22 curation fee or a monthly subscription for the same price.

Dating giant Bumble is among the more established players to enter the friendship space, launching its friend-finding feature in 2016, which then spun out into a stand-alone app in 2023. The friend-making app has recently undergone a significant redesign, with an increased emphasis on facilitating group meetups, catering to users’ desires to grow their social circles.

BFF is available for free download on iOS and Android devices.

Clyx is another emerging app in the group-based social networking landscape, with a strong focus on discovering local events. The social platform helps users find community events by integrating data from platforms like Ticketmaster and TikTok. Additionally, Clyx allows users to upload their contact lists, helping them see which events their friends plan to attend. The app also includes a feature that recommends other users to connect with at these events.

As of now, Clyx operates exclusively in two cities: Miami and London. However, it has plans to expand to additional areas in the near future, with New York City and São Paulo at the top of the list. The app is available on the App Store and Google Play Store.

Les Amís is a friendship app tailored for women, transgender, and LGBTQ+ individuals that leverages AI to match users based on similar interests and encourages participation in local events, such as pottery classes, book clubs, and wine tastings. Matches are made every Monday, allowing users to chat and plan meetups later in the week.

Available on iOS and Android, Les Amís serves cities across Europe, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Madrid, Paris, and Stockholm. In the U.S., the app is available in Austin and New York, with plans to expand to Boston, Miami, and Los Angeles.

The app uses a paid membership model that varies by city, with fees of $70 in New York and €55 in Amsterdam.

The local event-discovery platform has been around since 2002, helping millions of users connect with others who share similar interests. Users can RSVP to events; join groups that cater to a variety of hobbies, professions, or social causes; and create their own groups and events. They can also chat with group members and post updates and photos from gatherings.

This European community-building app recently launched in the U.S., targeting users over 40 who want to meet new people in their area and participate in group activities such as picnics, concerts, and hiking. Notably, in a short time, there have been around 777,000 U.S. downloads so far across the App Store and Google Play Store, according to Appfigures estimates.

Pie is another one of the newer social apps on the market. It features an AI-driven quiz designed to predict which users are most likely to be compatible with each other. Each person who RSVPs to a Pie event takes a brief personality assessment, and the algorithm organizes attendees into groups of six, who are then added to a group chat within the Pie app, allowing them to interact with each other before the event.

Currently, the app is only available in Austin, Chicago, and San Francisco. Users can download Pie from the App Store and Google Play Store.

Timeleft is a relatively new platform that helps you organize weekly dinner dates with groups of strangers. The app uses a special algorithm to match you with others, taking into account your age, gender, and personality. Users are matched with four other people, but they only learn minor details about them the night before, including their occupations and zodiac signs.

Dinners take place at a selected restaurant on Wednesday evenings at 7:00 p.m. To help everyone break the ice, the app offers a game with conversation starters. After dinner, there is an after-party at a local bar.

Users can book dinners online or through the app. In terms of pricing, it varies depending on the country and restaurant. Users pay for a ticket up front and are responsible for covering their own dinner and drinks.

Wyzr Friends is an activity-based friendship app designed for adults 40 and older, catering to empty nesters, those who are divorced, and other users seeking to connect with like-minded individuals. Users can thumbs up or down potential friends and arrange in-person activities based on shared interests, such as going to the movies or hiking.

It’s available on iOS and Android devices in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore, and Mexico.

Mmotion is a newly launched friendship app that blends location tracking with social discovery to help users connect with people nearby and explore new bars and restaurants in their area. Upon joining, users can participate in interest-based groups—such as hiking, basketball, or art—view a map of active users, and send messages to those nearby. The app also highlights new places on the map, making it easy to find a restaurant or venue to try.

Mmotion is currently only available to users in New York City on iOS and Android devices. Users must first submit an application to be considered.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Each year, we ask some top investors what they think the next year will bring. Last year, some investors thought the IPO market would be back up and running by now (which didn’t quite happen), while others thought the momentum behind AI was poised to accelerate (and they were right). This year, TechCrunch did the same thing, talking to five investors from various markets about what they are preparing for in 2026.

James Norman, Managing Partner, Black Ops VC

Raising in 2025 requires a shift from ‘visionary’ to ‘battle-tested.’ In previous years, capital has been a primary moat; now, investors are wary of ‘pilot purgatory,’ when enterprises test AI solutions without an urgent need to buy. In 2026, the bar is rising. Founders must prove to VCs they have more than just traction; they need a distribution advantage. Investors are digging deeper into repeatable sales engines, proprietary workflow/processes and deep subject matter expertise that holds up against the  ‘capital arms race’. VCs no longer care about who’s first to market with a flashy demo. They want to know who’s building something that can last, earn trust, and scale long-term.

We believe the funding markets will always be available for the best founders, but the bar will rise. At the earliest stages, especially in AI application software, I do expect fewer mega seed rounds given intense competition and capital already deployed across many categories. Founders will need to stand out with unique distribution channels or perspectives, not just by relying on a large market opportunity and strong backgrounds. Capital moats have already formed around crowded sectors. At the Series-A and B stages, top-quartile rounds will require clear evidence of explosive momentum. The market has now adjusted to these expectations with increased scrutiny on the sustainability of revenue.

Allen Taylor, Managing Partner, Endeavor Catalyst

Bigger, faster, better: bigger total addressable market, faster growth, better unit economics. We made 50 investments last year across 25 countries, and we expect to do more this year, so we’re seeing founders at very different stages and in very different markets. The strongest founders aren’t just showing what they’ve built so far — they’re helping investors understand where the business is going next. Real revenue and real customers still matter, but they’re not sufficient on their own. As an investor, I’m always asking: Where is this company today, and where could it realistically be in the next 12, 18, or 24 months? The founders who raise are the ones who can answer that question clearly and credibly.

Dorothy Chang, Partner, Flybridge Capital

A lot of founders are finding it easy to build new things because genAI coding tools are so advanced today. But in truth, those tools are leveling the playing field for everyone, and competition is more fierce than ever. So founders building for venture scale need to make sure that they are: 1) truly tackling a big idea, not just something that’s easy to vibe code, 2) building in a problem area that they are uniquely positioned to win, and 3) bringing something proprietary that can’t easily be replicated. This could be a contrarian approach with unique insights, proprietary access to data, deep networks/relationships, a technological advantage, etc. These aren’t new concepts, but the stakes and expectations are higher than ever.

For founders selling to enterprises, I think the entire world has gotten smarter on the value that AI can deliver, and as such, proving — showing line of sight to ROI — will be more important than ever to investors. Founders who can prove that their products offer much higher value have the best shot at raising capital.

As a fund, we remain industry-agnostic generalists, but we are always sharpening our lens. Today we’re looking for ‘high-context founders.’ In a world where AI has commoditized the ability to write code, the winning edge is now lived experience. We want to invest in the founder who has spent years in the trenches of a complex industry and possesses the bespoke expertise that can be 10x’d by AI. For us, the ideal investment is a marriage of deep subject matter expertise and a ‘day zero’ distribution advantage, meaning founders don’t just know what to build but already know exactly who is going to buy it.

We are particularly interested in sleepy or legacy industries that sit outside core tech founder appetite, where AI can offer step change ROI that drives adoption. These markets have lower competition and moats driven by complexity that often come with less obvious sectors. We also believe 2026 will be a great year for infrastructure supporting foundational model development, as well as frontier research categories like embodied AI and world models. Healthcare remains a major focus given clear signs of buyer demand; we focus on systems of record and platforms rather than point solutions.

Outside the United States! The best risk-adjusted venture returns are not in Silicon Valley anymore. They are in markets like Poland, Turkey, and Greece.

When you invest across 25 countries in a single year, you stop thinking of venture as something that happens in one place and then spreads outward. Twenty years ago, roughly 90% of venture dollars went to the United States. That flipped in 2018. Today, more than half of venture investment — and more than half of the world’s unicorns — are outside the U.S.

We see this every day. Founders in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia are building venture-scale companies — often serving massive markets from the start. In our pipeline, it’s normal to see founders from Venezuela building in Iraq, or from Sudan building global businesses.

I’m most interested in founders who are tackling massive problems and leveraging technology for forward progress. I’m rather unmoved by the plethora of startups focused on agentically automating workflows for specific verticals. I’m much more interested in the larger platform shifts that will define this era of technological and societal progress.

We’ve seen tremendous impact on software from AI. I think the next frontier is at the intersection of software and hardware. Most of the world’s GDP is locked up in physical industries, and software-only solutions aren’t enough to fully unlock the world’s growth potential.

Yes, the IPO market is likely to thaw, not because conditions are suddenly ideal, but because the system is running out of viable alternatives. We’re approaching a tipping point where the private market’s ability to sustain multi-billion-dollar valuations, often disconnected from profitability or liquidity, is wearing thin. Years of “paper markups” have postponed reality, but they haven’t eliminated it. Companies, boards, and late-stage investors increasingly need a mechanism to reset expectations, generate real liquidity, and re-establish price discovery.

Private credit has acted as a stopgap, extending runways without forcing valuation discipline. But that bridge is starting to look more like a pressure cooker. Debt can delay decisions, not solve structural capital needs, especially for companies built for equity-style growth. At some point, fresh capital becomes necessary, and public markets remain the only place capable of providing it at scale. Their growth narratives and strategic importance can provide the “air cover” needed to reopen the IPO window. Once investors re-engage around category-defining leaders, it creates permission for the broader high-growth software sector to follow.

I think we will see a reopening of the IPO markets driven by the backlog of companies planning to list. Many large tech IPOs are anticipated, including darlings like Anthropic and OpenAI, and I believe one of these mega IPOs will drive considerable momentum for others.

Yes. 2026 will be a big year for IPOs in New York as dozens of the top companies simply decide “it’s time.” It will also be a banner year for tech IPOs in places folks are not used to seeing them — like the stock market in Saudi Arabia.

I think people underestimate how global the thaw will be. We’ve had nearly four years of muted IPO activity, which has created a backlog of high-quality companies that are ready to be public. When the window opens, it won’t just be U.S. companies stepping through it. There’s already a cohort of major U.S.-listed technology companies from Latin America, including MercadoLibre and Nubank, and there’s another wave right behind them that public-market investors haven’t fully priced in yet. I don’t think all of those companies list in 2026, but several will.

What’s even more unexpected is what happens locally. You’re going to see meaningful technology IPOs in places like Saudi Arabia, listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). When companies like Tabby [a buy-now-pay-later outfit] go public locally, it will challenge assumptions about where global tech outcomes happen.

We’re looking to make slightly fewer, more concentrated bets. There is a ton of startup activity, so when we meet founders who really stand out, we want to be able to back up our high conviction with a higher check size and higher ownership percentage.

I think a hard catalyst would be required to reset the IPO markets — something akin to mega AI players facing unprecedented cost increases or sharp revenue declines. Think, for example, of energy prices sharply rising, such that it’s unaffordable to offer compute for AI training and inference.

We’re entering what I’d describe as a clearing event for the venture market, and next year will separate durable platforms from transient ones. The fallout will hit Fund I managers who haven’t found their footing, and active Fund II managers struggling with a [distributions-paid-in-capital, or DPI] drought from 2021 vintages. Traditional institutional anchors, particularly university endowments, are effectively in repair mode. After being squeezed by the absence of liquidity in 2021 and 2022, many are leaning on secondaries, pacing adjustments, and portfolio-smoothing strategies just to maintain existing commitments.

That means fewer new relationships and far less tolerance for emerging or undifferentiated managers. Stepping into their place are family offices that have moved from passive LP roles to active market forces. They aren’t just filling the ‘LP oxygen’ left by retreating institutions; they are scoping direct mandates and using [registered investment advisors]  to hunt for unique, high-conviction strategies.

In 2026, there is no viable middle ground. You need to have a clinical, defensible track record and/or truly unfair access to differentiated deal flow. Lightly grounded generalist positioning, soft networks, and “good enough” performance won’t survive this cycle.

We believe we are in the early innings of AI transformation, so we expect next year to be a strong vintage. Capital continues to concentrate in a select number of winners so we focus on being selective and operationally supporting our companies to earn our right to concentrate. We are advising our portfolio companies to strengthen their balance sheets in case of a downturn in 2026 while focusing on building for the long term rather than optimizing for fast funding.

Amazing time to back the boldest founders building for the next 10+ years! From a fund manager’s perspective, 2026 looks strong on both deployment and liquidity. Last year we had 12 liquidity events — all through M&A and secondaries. That matters because venture has grown dramatically over the last two decades, while paths to liquidity didn’t keep pace. What’s changing now is that venture is building a more complete liquidity toolkit — M&A, secondaries, and IPOs working together.

That’s critical when founders are committing 10, 15, even 20 years to building companies. At the same time, we’re seeing real structural shifts in core sectors. Financial technology, especially stablecoins, moved from experimentation to mainstream adoption in 2025, particularly in markets like Latin America and Africa. In those places, this isn’t speculative technology; it’s infrastructure. That combination is why 2026 looks like a strong year to be deploying capital.

We’re still searching for phenomenal European founders building groundbreaking companies. Great companies are formed in all cycles.

In 2026, the ‘AI curiosity’ that fueled the last two years is being replaced by a demand for application and scale. We are moving from the era of building models to the era of building businesses. The fastest, most innovative companies aren’t the ones with the largest LLMs, they are the ones using AI to solve high-value, domain-specific problems that were previously too complex or too manual to scale. Investors aren’t looking for ‘AI startups’ anymore; we’re looking for exceptional tech founders who have found a way to use this intelligence to 10x the efficiency of a massive, traditional market.

We expect investor and startup interest to continue at all-time highs. However, I do think we will start to see tuck-in acquisitions, acquihires and wind-downs in highly concentrated sectors such as coding automation, sales automation, marketing and advertising as market share starts to concentrate in select assets.

It will continue. But by the end of 2026, I predict AI will stop being a separate category as it will just be a part of all new technology companies being built.

There’s a lot of breathless talk about AI right now — and that’s understandable. We’re still very early in understanding what this technology will actually change. In moments like this, excitement tends to run ahead of clarity. Some companies will be transformational, many won’t, and pricing will take time to adjust as real use cases emerge. The opportunity isn’t in labeling everything as “AI.” It’s in understanding where AI meaningfully changes cost structures, speed, or decision-making inside real businesses. That’s where durable value gets created.

This is one of those moments when the fog is thick, and that’s when outcomes diverge the most.

I don’t see it slowing down anytime soon. We’ve seen a lot of dollars go into infrastructure and theory; this year we’ll see a lot more of that investment more clearly turn into enterprise value at the application level.

AI will remain a hot topic, barring negative hard catalysts that dramatically change conditions, like an energy crisis or a rise in default rates.

One of the most unexpected shifts of 2026 will be the quiet end of the “ChatGPT-first” era in startups. Not because generative AI loses importance, but because no single model remains the default starting point. GPT is no longer consistently best-in-class for search, image generation, or video, which fundamentally changes how tech companies architect their products. The savvy founders in 2026 have already graduated to a multi-model world, and instead their focus has shifted to specialization.

For example, Anthropic has effectively captured the developer’s mindshare because Claude Code is better at building with you, and Google has finally activated its structural advantages. With Gemini 3, it’s pairing top-tier image and video generation with deep multimodal capability and native access to Google’s search and data ecosystem. That combination is proving hard to compete with. Model choice becomes an infrastructure decision, not a moat. The winners in 2026 won’t be the companies that “use GPT,” but the ones that orchestrate multiple models seamlessly, abstract complexity away from users, and build proprietary workflows on top.

We expect to see many successful startups built with only one or two rounds of capital. AI tooling (especially coding automation) enables many early-stage companies to accomplish profitability without excessive burn. From a technology perspective, while LLMs are expected to be everywhere, companies will start to scale back usage in favor of more controlled use as enterprises prioritize explainability, cost and reliability. This could drive heavier use of small models, deterministic and probabilistic hybrid models, world models, or simulation modeling.

The end of the Russia-Ukraine war will bring about a renaissance of investing in Ukrainian founders, who are some of the best in the world! Two additional things will genuinely surprise people. First, international companies — especially from Latin America — going public in New York at scale. Second, major technology IPOs coming out of the Middle East, listed locally. When companies like Tabby go public on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), it will reset expectations about where global tech leadership lives.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/26/nawares-chemical-free-weed-killer-tech-could-change-how-we-treat-lawns/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Naware founder Mark Boysen first tried killing weeds with drones and a 200-watt laser.

He’d been noodling on ideas for a startup with some friends, and thinking about how his family in North Dakota had lost three members to cancer, something they suspected may be related to chemicals in the groundwater. Finding a chemical-free way to kill weeds seemed like a solid option.

But the laser was a dead end. There’s too much risk of starting a fire, he told TechCrunch in an interview. After a lot of trial and error prototyping with ideas like cryogenics, the solution he settled on — which he showed off earlier this year at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — is steam.

Boysen’s company has developed a system that uses computer vision to spot weeds in lawns and fields and golf courses, and kill them with nothing but vaporized water. It can be attached to mowers, or tractors, or even ATVs. At the moment, Naware is flexible, and Boysen is visibly eager for his idea to spread fast — much like the weeds he’s trying to kill.

In a world of agentic AI and billion-dollar software companies, Naware stands out as a classic garage startup story. Boysen said his team first tested the use of steam by ordering a “rinky dink” garment steamer off of Amazon. After that, they ordered seven more.

“They’re not real industrial,” Boysen said. “And so there’s a lot of research helping to develop that, to get to the point of: ‘How do we make this effective and make it repeatable so it can scale?’”

Developing the steamer tech was one challenge, but the bigger one may have been identifying the weeds, Boysen said. It’s well-established that artificial intelligence software can be trained to accurately recognize objects or patterns, but the “green-on-green” problem was tough, he said — especially because the software has to recognize the weeds in real time while the rig is prowling over a lawn. (And yes, it’s using Nvidia GPUs.)

He thinks they’ve gotten there, though. He said Naware is targeting companies that do lawn care for athletic fields and golf courses, and claims his company can save customers like that “anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000 on chemicals alone.”

On top of that, he said customers will save money by not having to pay for people whose only job is to spray those chemicals. Naware has been doing paid pilots to test and dial in the product, but Boysen’s pitch has already attracted prospective partners, he said.

“We’re going after the strategic partnerships. We’re in discussions with $5 billion companies that do equipment manufacturing that are interested in our product. And we’re a couple conversations into that — I can’t say their name, but you’ll figure it out,” he laughed.

Success, Boysen said, will take three things: those partnerships, securing patents, and funding. Boysen has been bootstrapping Naware for now but said he’ll open its first fundraising round in the coming months.

“I’ve got to get a funding round that just crushes anybody else trying to think about it,” he said. “I’ve got to deliver the promise that I can kill weeds, and it’s effective. And we’ll make it work. I’m not concerned about that.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although smart glasses have been around for a while, the technology is getting more advanced each year, so much so that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims the wearables will replace smartphones in the next decade (though many people disagree, of course).

Smart glasses are no longer just a futuristic gadget — they’ve become practical tools that people use to communicate, navigate, track fitness, watch movies, enjoy immersive gaming, and more.

Whether you’re looking to get a pair for yourself, buy one as a gift, or simply explore what’s available on the market today, we’ve compiled a list of the most compelling options. This list features smart glasses with and without displays, designed for everyday wear, sports, work, and gaming.

We’ve also highlighted upcoming launches to watch as the smart glasses market heats up.

The nice thing about the Ray-Ban Meta glasses is that they look like regular glasses, which is great for people who don’t want to compromise on aesthetics. The smart glasses come in many styles, so you can pick a pair based on your personal style.

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses have a 12-megapixel camera, open-ear speakers, and five microphones. They offer twice the battery life of their predecessor, lasting up to eight hours with typical use. They can charge to 50% in just 20 minutes, and you can purchase a case that provides an additional 48 hours of battery life.

The glasses feature 3K Ultra HD video capture, which is two times more pixels than the previous generation. They come with 32GB of storage and an IPX4 water-resistance rating, which means they’re protected in light rain.

They also have a slew of AI features, including the ability to say “Hey Meta” to do things like get information and set reminders, along with real-time translation, hands-free photo and video capture, the option to ask about what you’re seeing, and more.

The Viture Luma Pro glasses offer one of the best displays on smart glasses available right now. They feature Sony’s micro-OLED panels to deliver a crisp 1200p image on a 152-inch virtual screen, with a 120 Hz refresh rate, a wide 52-degree field of view, and up to 1,000 nits of perceived brightness. (Nits measure screen brightness — higher numbers mean you can see the display more clearly in bright environments.)

You can plug the Luma Pro XR glasses into many phones, tablets, handhelds, and laptops with USB-C to mirror their display. This makes them a great option for people who want to game on a large, immersive screen, whether they’re on the go or the TV is in use. They’re also useful for frequent travelers and people who want a virtual multi-screen setup for work.

They come with built-in support for mild myopia, allowing users with up to -4.0 diopters of nearsightedness to experience a clear virtual display without needing prescription lenses.

In terms of aesthetics, they’re a bit chunky, but not overly bulky.

They retail for $499 (currently on sale for $449).

The Xreal One Pro smart glasses are one of the most premium models available on the market right now, with a $649 price tag. They’re a good choice for people who are already familiar with smart glasses and want an upgrade.

The glasses’ flat-prism design allows for a sleek and comfortable fit. They feature a virtual display of up to 171 inches, with 1080p resolution, a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and a 57-degree field of view.

The Xreal One Pro smart glasses come with built-in Bose speakers and 700 nits of brightness, allowing for use in brighter environments.

They are built on Xreal’s custom X1 chip, which enables 3DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom). This means the glasses track your head’s rotational movements, keeping virtual content pinned in space relative to your head. In short, if you turn your head, the virtual screen stays in place rather than moving with you.

They feature a built-in button array that lets you quickly change your screen size, distance, color temperature, and more.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses are the best option for outdoorsy people and athletes, as they were specifically designed with them in mind. The glasses can capture video in up to 3K resolution and feature a 12-megapixel camera with a 122-degree wide-angle lens.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses feature a programmable button that can trigger a custom AI prompt, which you can set up using the Meta AI app. All the buttons on the glasses are located underneath to allow athletes to wear helmets comfortably while using them.

They offer up to nine hours of battery life, or up to six hours of continuous music playback.

The glasses come with a charging case that can provide an additional 36 hours of charge on the go. Plus, you can charge the glasses to 50% in 20 minutes via the charging case.

They also feature a five-microphone array optimized to reduce wind noise while on calls, messaging, or using Meta AI with your voice. The glasses have an IP67 dust and water-resistance rating for use during intense workouts (this rating means they can withstand being submerged in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes).

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses cost $499.

The RayNeo Air 3s are a great budget-friendly choice for anyone just getting started with smart glasses. They offer impressive visuals and features for the price and are great for light gaming or watching content on long journeys.

They feature micro‑OLED displays that create a virtual 201‑inch screen at 1080p resolution, with a 120 Hz refresh rate, a 46-degree field of view, and about 650 nits of perceived brightness.

While the field of view is narrower than some premium models and they don’t have head tracking, they’re a good option for people who simply want an external display on the go without breaking the bank.

The glasses use a micro‑OLED “HueView” display with eye protection features like 3840 Hz hybrid dimming and low blue‑light certification to reduce eye strain during extended use.

The RayNeo Air 3s cost $269 (currently on sale for $219).

Project Aura: Google and Xreal are collaborating on a pair of Android XR-powered glasses that are equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology. The glasses can function as an extended workspace or entertainment device, allowing the user to use Google’s suite of products or stream video as they would on a more advanced headset. The glasses are launching next year.

Snap Specs: Snap is set to release a lightweight consumer version of its AR glasses in 2026, bringing many of the same augmented reality and AI features found in the developer-focused Spectacles 5. The new glasses are expected to be smaller and lighter, making them more discreet and comfortable to wear in public compared to their bulky predecessors.

Apple AI smart glasses: Apple is reportedly sidelining plans to overhaul its Vision Pro headset to focus on developing AI smart glasses that can compete with products from Meta. They will have many of the same features available on the social media giant’s current smart glasses. The glasses are expected to debut in 2026.

            <div id="article-text">It’s the end of the year. That means it’s time for us to celebrate the best cybersecurity stories we didn’t publish. Since 2023, TechCrunch has looked back at the best stories across the board from the year in cybersecurity.

If you’re not familiar, the idea is simple. There are now dozens of journalists who cover cybersecurity in the English language. There are a lot of stories about cybersecurity, privacy, and surveillance that are published every week. And a lot of them are great, and you should read them. We’re here to recommend the ones we liked the most, so keep in mind that it’s a very subjective and, at the end of the day, incomplete list.

Anyway, let’s get into it. — Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai

Every once in a while, there’s a hacker story that as soon as you start reading, you think it could be a movie or a TV show. This is the case with Shane Harris’ very personal tale of his months-long correspondence with a top Iranian hacker.

In 2016, The Atlantic’s journalist made contact with a person claiming to work as a hacker for Iran’s intelligence, where he claimed to have worked on major operations, such as the downing of an American drone and the now-infamous hack against oil giant Saudi Aramco, where Iranian hackers wiped the company’s computers. Harris was rightly skeptical, but as he kept talking to the hacker, who eventually revealed his real name to him, Harris started to believe him. When the hacker died, Harris was able to piece together the real story, which somehow turned out to be more incredible than the hacker had led Harris to believe.

The gripping story is also a great behind-the-scenes look at the challenges cybersecurity reporters face when dealing with sources claiming to have great stories to share.

In January, the U.K. government secretly issued Apple with a court order demanding that the company build a back door so police can access the iCloud data of any customer in the world. Due to a worldwide gag order, it was only because The Washington Post broke the news that we learned the order existed to begin with. The demand was the first of its kind, and — if successful — would be a major defeat for tech giants who have spent the past decade locking themselves out of their users’ own data so they can’t be compelled to provide it to governments.

Apple subsequently stopped offering its opt-in end-to-end encrypted cloud storage to its customers in the U.K. in response to the demand. But by breaking the news, the secret order was thrust into the public eye and allowed both Apple and critics to scrutinize U.K. surveillance powers in a way that hasn’t been tested in public before. The story sparked a months-long diplomatic row between the U.K. and the United States, prompting Downing Street to drop the request — only to try again several months later.

This story was the sort of fly-on-the-wall access that some reporters would dream of, but The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief got to play out in real time after he was unwittingly added to a Signal group of senior U.S. government officials by a senior U.S. government official discussing war plans on their cell phones.

Reading the discussion about where U.S. military forces should drop bombs — and then seeing news reports of missiles hitting the ground on the other side of the world — was confirmation that Jeffrey Goldberg needed to know that he was, as he suspected, in a real chat with real Trump administration officials, and this was all on-the-record and reportable.

And so he did, paving the way for a months-long investigation (and critique) of the government’s operational security practices, in what was called the biggest government opsec mistake in history. The unraveling of the situation ultimately exposed security lapses involving the use of a knock-off Signal clone that further jeopardized the government’s ostensibly secure communications.

Brian Krebs is one of the more veteran cybersecurity reporters out there, and for years he has specialized in following online breadcrumbs that lead to him revealing the identity of notorious cybercriminals. In this case, Krebs was able to find the real identity behind a hacker’s online handle Rey, who is part of the notorious advanced persistent teenagers‘ cybercrime group that calls itself Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters.

Krebs’ quest was so successful that he was able to talk to a person very close to the hacker — we won’t spoil the whole article here — and then the hacker himself, who confessed to his crimes and claimed he was trying to escape the cybercriminal life.

Independent media outlet 404 Media has accomplished more impact journalism this year than most mainstream outlets with vastly more resources. One of its biggest wins was exposing and effectively shuttering a massive air travel surveillance system tapped by federal agencies and operating in plain sight.

404 Media reported that a little-known data broker set up by the airline industry called the Airlines Reporting Corporation was selling access to 5 billion plane tickets and travel itineraries, including names and financial details of ordinary Americans, allowing government agencies like ICE, the State Department, and the IRS to track people without a warrant.

ARC, owned by United, American, Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, and other airlines, said it would shut down the warrantless data program following 404 Media’s months-long reporting and intense pressure from lawmakers.

The killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024 was one of the biggest stories of the year. Luigi Mangione, the chief suspect in the killing, was soon after arrested and indicted on charges of using a “ghost gun,” a 3D-printed firearm that had no serial numbers and built in private without a background check — effectively a gun that the government has no idea exists.

Wired, using its past reporting experience on 3D-printed weaponry, sought to test how easy it would be to build a 3D-printed gun, while navigating the patchwork legal (and ethical) landscape. The reporting process was exquisitely told, and the video that goes along with the story is both excellent and chilling.

DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, was one of the biggest running stories of the year, as the gang of Elon Musk’s lackeys ripped through the federal government, tearing down security protocols and red tape, as part of the mass-grab of citizens’ data. NPR had some of the best investigative reporting uncovering the resistance movement of federal workers trying to prevent the pilfering of the government’s most sensitive data.

In one story detailing a whistleblower’s official disclosure as shared with members of Congress, a senior IT employee in the National Labor Relations Board told lawmakers that as he was seeking help investigating DOGE’s activity, he “found a printed letter in an envelope taped to his door, which included threatening language, sensitive personal information and overhead pictures of him walking his dog, according to the cover letter attached to his official disclosure.”

Any story that starts with a journalist saying they found something that made them “feel like shitting my pants,” you know it’s going to be a fun read. Gabriel Geiger found a dataset from a mysterious surveillance company called First Wap, which contained records on thousands of people from around the world whose phone locations had been tracked.

The dataset, spanning 2007 through 2015, allowed Geiger to identify dozens of high-profile people whose phones were tracked, including a former Syrian first lady, the head of a private military contractor, a Hollywood actor, and an enemy of the Vatican. This story explored the shadowy world of phone surveillance by exploiting Signaling System No. 7, or SS7, an obscurely named protocol long known to allow malicious tracking.

Swatting has been a problem for years. What started as a bad joke has become a real threat, which has resulted in at least one death. Swatting is a type of hoax where someone — often a hacker — calls the emergency services and tricks the authorities into sending an armed SWAT team to the home of the hoaxer’s target, often pretending to be the target themselves and pretending they are about to commit a violent crime.

In this feature, Wired’s Andy Greenberg put a face on the many characters who are part of these stories, such as the call operators who have to deal with this problem. And he also profiled a prolific swatter, known as Torswats, who for months tormented the operators and schools all over the country with fake — but extremely believable — threats of violence, as well as a hacker who took it upon himself to track Torswats down.

Are your parents addicted to their phone? In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel explores how technology is affecting an older generation of adults. Instead of a phone-based childhood, Warzel suggests, we may be witnessing the emergence of a phone-based retirement—one shaped by isolation, algorithmic feeds, and platforms never designed with aging users in mind.

To untangle whether this is a genuine crisis or a misplaced moral panic, Warzel speaks with Ipsit Vahia, chief of geriatric psychiatry at Mass General Brigham’s McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and a leading researcher on technology and aging. Vahia emphasizes that older adults are anything but a single category, and that screen use can be both protective and harmful, depending on context. The key, Vahia argues, is resisting reflexive judgment. Ultimately, this is an issue not of screens versus humans, but of how families navigate connection in a world where attention is mediated by devices in every age group.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Ipsit Vahia: Don’t go, You’re spending too much time on the phone. Instead, perhaps ask, What are you watching on your phone? What apps are you into? This is what I do with my phone. You could use their phone use as a conversation starter, as a way to meet them where they are, as a way to perhaps enter their world rather than expecting them to jump straight into your world. And, you know, it can just be the basis of strengthening connection rather than breaking it.

Charlie Warzel: I am Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. About a year ago, around the holidays, I began to hear a similar complaint. People were heading home, often with their kids in tow, to be with family. It was there that they noticed that their parents, or grandparents, or older relatives were behaving differently.

Broadly, the complaint was that their older loved ones seemed consumed by their devices—constantly on TikTok or Instagram or Facebook, watching vertical-reel videos. Sometimes they said they found it hard to hold a conversation. In multiple instances, people reported that some of these adults seemed to not pay much attention to their grandchildren.

Most of the people that I spoke to recognized it pretty quickly. It was the same thing they’d seen in their own kids: a screen-time problem. So, naturally I was curious. I wanted to get a sense of the scale of this. So I asked around on social media. I got dozens of responses over the year. From young people, from older people. Lots, lots of people.

Some older folks, they wrote in to tell me that they felt bad about how much time they were beginning to spend on social media. Others told me they’d found joy in the process and that there was no problem and I was over-hyping it. But many confirmed the anecdotes. Some feared that their loved ones were growing depressed or anxious as a result of a problematic relationship with their screens.

Others worried about older relatives falling victim to scams. Almost all of them, though, stressed that this felt like an emergent phenomenon—something that had popped up since the pandemic. I heard stories like this one from Josh.

Josh: It’s super interesting to watch my kids and my dad interact in the same space. With my kids, they love screens. They’ll spend an hour most mornings watching Bluey or Sesame Street or something. But when it’s off, they generally switch gears. They’ll go bike, they’ll do gymnastics, they’ll play board games. They engage with the world around them. My dad, on the other hand, is constantly glued to his screen.

He’s reading the news; he’s scrolling through his email. With my dad, there is no off switch. When we look at photos from his trips to see us, they show the kids engaging with their grandma, playing games, being silly, while grandpa’s in the background playing a game on his iPad.

Kim: I’m 55. I have tween twin girls. I worry a lot and spend a lot of time controlling their screen time. And it’s kind of a joke, because if they saw the amount of screen time that I have in a day, it is way more.

Warzel: Kyle worries about what his parents are seeing.

Kyle: It’s really tricky to talk to my parents about anything news-related.

My parents are both, you know—they’re very intelligent, they’re thoughtful people. But media literacy is a problem for them in a way that it isn’t for my teenage kids who were kind of raised with an understanding of the dynamics of digital content. I mean, we all spend our days staring at screens. But the screens that my parents are staring at is this really toxic combination of Facebook and Fox News.

So it gives them these distorted views of things. You know, like: Portland is violent; New York City is super dangerous; immigrants are selling fentanyl to schoolkids; isn’t [Zohran] Mamdani anti-Semitic? You know, that kind of thing. And it’s hard to break through that information bubble. I’ll call my mom out sometimes for sharing disinformation online. But like, how do you tell your mom she’s participating in a Russian disinformation campaign? I sound like the crazy person in that conversation.

Warzel: But perhaps the most affecting one came from a nurse in the United Kingdom

Nurse: I’m a nurse in the U.K., working in an inpatient ward. Most of our patients are in the 50-plus age group, and the majority have smartphones or iPads. When you’re stuck as a patient in the hospital, a lot of the time you’re bored or lonely or both. That can mean loads of really excessive screen time. It’s probably the 50-to-75 age group I’m most worried about, because they’re tech savvy enough to be where they want to be online, but they’re not necessarily media literate.

They might not recognize harms or understand how algorithms funnel consumption in certain directions. Some of it is fairly benign, like being obsessed with fake-AI animal stuff or compilation videos of babies. And sometimes it’s actually been pretty funny, like when folk end up in an autoplay cul-de-sac of Chinese-language videos.

But I do think the negative effects of excessive scrolling are bleeding through more, mostly in the anti-immigration stuff we hear. And the conspiracy thinking, medical distrust too.

Warzel: These testimonies struck me in part because they sound quite a lot like the concerns voiced for years by parents about children and devices. In the last decade-plus, there have been endless panics—many warranted, and others less borne out by the evidence—about children and screens. That their young minds are being influenced or warped by devices designed to take advantage of them. In most cases, screen panics position children as defenseless, even agentless.

They’re confronting this force that’s powerful enough to cause problematic behaviors among their underdeveloped minds. But now it seems the problem exists on the opposite side of the age spectrum. Data suggest there’s a reason people might be noticing this more now, because more people are aging into a retirement era with more fluency with smartphones and tablets and social media. On YouTube, for example older people are among the platform’s fastest-growing demographic. It’s possible that the pandemic and the attendant isolation accelerated all this adoption, from rideshare apps to Zoom. The confluence here seems very real. Older individuals may have extra time, and they may be more socially isolated than other demographics—and they’re seeing their retirement era just collide with this extremely powerful algorithmic world of social networks, apps, on-demand streaming services, and even the arrival of generative AI.

These are things that confound people of all age groups. But older people are not by any means a monolith, and technological tools are very clearly lifelines for aging people. As well as tools that can bring great joy, information—help them live full and creative lives. This is a really complicated issue, and so I wanted to speak with an expert and find the perfect guest here.

Dr. Ipsit Vahia is the chief of geriatric psychiatry at Mass General’s McLean Hospital. He’s the director of its technology and aging laboratory, and he’s been studying this phenomenon—and more importantly, working with patients in clinical settings. He joins me now to talk about all of this.

Vahia: Thank you for having me. Delighted to be here.

Warzel: So you head up the technology and aging laboratory at McLean Hospital. Can you tell me what you all do there?

Vahia: Sure. So it’s a clinical-research laboratory that’s focused on understanding the way older adults use technology, and then also leveraging technology in a clinical setting with older adults with dementia or other mental-health challenges.

So we have a broad range of areas in which we do research. This includes early diagnostics, technologies for monitoring and supporting clinical decision making. But they’re also developing interventions using tech.

Warzel: So how did you get into this line of work, especially working with people on the furthest side of the age spectrum there?

Vahia: There’s actually an origin story there. When I was a trainee, it was when smartphones first came about, and I think I remember this incident very specifically. It was the year 2009. I was a trainee in California, and my wife and I were out for dinner with friends, and we had a 4-year-old child in tow. And he was doing what 4-year-olds do. He was boisterous, and I saw a simple thing. Again—this is circa 2009, so this is quite common now.

But in 2009, I had never seen this before, where my friend took out his smartphone and gave it to his child. And the child was engaged with it, and we didn’t hear a peep from him. We made it through four courses of dinner. Glass of wine, even.

Vahia: Now it’s default. But back then, the thing that it really made me think about was that: If this engagement with the screen could sort of stabilize the behavior of a child, could it do the same for someone that was, you know, functioning at the level of a child? Which is to say: someone with dementia. Could we use these devices to engage them? Could we use these devices to reduce agitation?

A little after that, when iPads came out, there was a different incident. So when I was working on the inpatient unit, we had a routine. And the routine would be that every morning started out with everyone gathering in the community area. And we would just read from the newspaper. And this was intended to sort of create the sense of community. A shared activity that brought everyone together. It also let us assess how people did in that group setting, because it’s a predictor of how they might do when they were on the outside. Now, on the morning that I was supposed to lead the meeting, the newspaper never showed up.

It was stolen, lost; we don’t know. But this was when iPads had just come out, and I happened to have a personal iPad with me. And an interesting thing happened that morning where, in the absence of the newspaper, I was able to pull out the newspaper’s website on the iPad. And we kind of went through the same exercise, but now it was digital.

And what happened was someone raised their hand and asked me—can you access only The San Diego Union-Tribune? I was training at UC San Diego, so that was the local paper. And I said, well, no, I can access any newspaper that has a website. Now, this was a Monday morning, and it was a very specific question. He said, “I’m from Pittsburgh. Can you tell me what they’re saying about the Steelers game last evening?” And so I did. I was able to pull up the column, and we talked about that when this happened. Another person raised their hand, and he’s like, “Well, that’s great. I’m from St. Louis. Can you find out what they’re saying about the Rams last evening?” And so I was able to do that.

And now, suddenly everyone was asking not for this one-size-fits-all newspaper reading, but they were able to get what was most important to them. And that was sort of the other big moment where I realized that you could, you know—with this device that we already had figured out engages people—we could also personalize the intervention.

And in many ways it was not about the tech at all. It was about what the tech made possible. And there’s a difference, because I think, to this day, some of the way we think about this is about the tech. But I’ve always thought about technology as a conduit to problem-solving and an intervention.

So as a clinician, the thing that we anchor our work around is: What is the patient need? Or, what is the clinical problem? And then think about—is the technology we have before us able to solve some of these?, And that served us well. I think that served us well.

Warzel:  So tell me a little bit about—you work with this elderly population; you’re working on these types of interventions.

You’re also deeply attuned to the way that they use and interact with technology. Broadly speaking, how would you classify how people on this side of the age spectrum are using technology? Are they a monolith? Are they extremely different and varied? Like, how would you describe, you know, the elderly’s interactions with technology?

Vahia: Thanks for that question. I think that’s the question that really gets at the heart of it all. So, I think if our listeners learn exactly one thing from this entire podcast, it should be that. Older adults are probably the most heterogeneous group of all the age groups. And we don’t always think of it that way, right?

We think of the elderly as this one monolithic entity. I love your use of that word. And nothing could be farther from the truth. So if you pause and just think about this for a second. We think of everyone over 65 as part of this one block, right? We have infants, and then we have toddlers, and then we have pre-K kids, and then we have elementary school. And we are quite sophisticated in the way we compartmentalize people across the age span.

But then we get to age about 65, and they’re all seen as this one block.

So. In the “elderly” group, if we consider people in their 90s and people in their 60s, these people are 30 years apart. If you’ve seen and understood one older adult’s use of technology, you’ve really seen and understood one older adult’s use of technology.

Yeah, and I think this overgeneralization does not serve us well. Which is not to say that there is not truth in the data. I think older adults, as a whole, do use less technology, but it varies quite a bit by. age cohort. So, you know, 80-year-olds may not be quite as digitally literate around apps or mobile phones, but 60-year-olds assuredly are very proficient as a group. Now there’s exceptions, obviously, on both ends.

Warzel: Well, that makes a lot of sense. Right? You would expect that between a 65-year-old and a 95-year-old, there’s 30 years there—there’s a lot of life and context experience. And I think you’re right that we do paint people in a lot of age brackets, but especially the elderly, with this really broad brush.

But I am curious from what you are seeing—and this will contextualize a little bit of what I want to dig into in this conversation—but do you notice that there is a different effect on older generations in terms of the way that they are using technology than, say, younger generations?

Like, if you were taking the bucket of zero to 10 versus, let’s say, like 75 to 85. Do older generations use—like, is the effective technology different than what you see on younger generations?

Vahia: It is, again, with the understanding that one size does not fit all. Older adults as a whole—they’re slower to take up new technology, and they’re much more methodical about it. So I think older adults as a whole are less likely to just experiment or play with tech. They adopt technology when it serves a clear and defined purpose in their lives on the whole. So a great example was what we found during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, right? Among older adults, being tech proficient actually predicted better mental health—and that’s because most of them use technology or newly adopted technology to stay connected. I’ll give you an example from our own work. We, like most health-care systems, sort of had this en-masse migration to telemedicine through Zoom or whatever. And we found that most of our patients were not already using this technology, and so we had to train them on how to use it.

And an interesting thing happened. We found that, of the people who were the majority that figured out how to use telemedicine through phones, et cetera, the ones who did best were the ones that learned Zoom. Not to keep their doctor’s appointments, but it was because their church started doing services virtually, or their family started having gatherings virtually. And then, once they learned it, they were using it way better and way more regularly and effectively than, say, younger populations. So the data are fascinating, because they find that high technology use in teenagers and adolescents is associated with worse mental health and is a predictor of sort of more isolation and loneliness, even depression. Whereas in older adults, engaging in technology seems to be protecting them from isolation and loneliness, and it seems to be enhancing connectivity. Now this finding might evolve over time, but broadly I think tech use and tech engagement is a positive for older adults, when broadly it’s more of a negative for younger adults.

Warzel: So that’s really fascinating and I think helpful in grounding what I want to get into here. Because there is a, I guess you’d call it like a meme online. But this is really just a whole bunch of anecdotal evidence that suggests that—I’ll put it this way—I have done a lot of reporting, talking to different people about elderly people and screen-time use. And a lot of what I’ve seen is these anecdotes from younger people. They go home for the holidays; they see that their loved ones who are older are kind of deeply engaged with their phones, with their iPads, with social media. In a way that younger people are recognizing—it’s potentially problematic. Or at least it makes them uncomfortable, right?

They come home; they say, I brought my kids over, you know, grandma and grandpa. Or Mom and Dad weren’t paying as much attention, right. They were just kind of stuck in their devices. This is really worrisome. And I have so many of these anecdotes that have piled up. Or you go on places like Reddit, and you see this “Help; my mom or dad has this screen-time problem.” And there is this developing feeling. I think you’re starting to see some news articles, and things like that, that say we associate screen-time problems with younger generations. We’re always worried about adolescents. And what they’re seeing—perhaps there is also this problem on the other side of the age spectrum.

I am curious: What is your reaction to all of that anecdotal evidence? Like, are you seeing this too? This idea that, where also technology may be beneficial, but are you seeing a screen-time problem forming generationally?

Vahia: So that is so interesting. Because I think the answer is yes. And I think we are seeing increased screen time among older adults as a whole. I think this is definitely true. But there’s a lot of nuance there. Because, I’ll preface it by saying that younger generations—you know, people are more similar to each other in the routines of their lives than not, right? Everyone goes to school. So there is sort of these like activities and routines that extend across the community.

And then, once we get older, you know, elementary-school kids are more like each other than middle-school kids. And middle-school kids are probably a little bit more like each other than high-school kids. And college kids are not quite as like each other. And then, you just continue to separate out. So as you get into late life, people have just had unique life experiences. And while there are similarities, I think there’s also a lot of differences in that life experience. And I think why that is relevant is—we have fewer sorts of ways to determine what constitutes problematic screen use.

So yes, there is increase in screen time; there is increase in screen use. But when that becomes problematic, you really kind of need to get into the weeds with each person to sort of decide if this is a good thing, if it is just what it is, or if it is a problem. To the example of people seeing their older loved ones at the holidays and finding out that they’re spending a lot more time with their phone than they used to. I hear that story in my clinic. I actually see that in my family—like, that’s probably familiar to a lot of people. And the way I think about it is, I mean, yes—you observe it when you meet them during the holidays. The problem is, you’re not there the rest of the time. And what are they doing with their lives the rest of their time? And is this a habit that formed because they just didn’t have all that much going on? And so, now their life is running more through their phone, through their perspective. Is it possible that they have a nice routine? Their phone is a big part of it, for better or worse. And your arrival is actually the disruption. Which is not—

Warzel: That’s so important though, right? Because there is this idea that you are dropping in to getting this window into their lives. Right? And when we talk about some of the issues, especially with people who are much older. Being isolated, being untethered from reality. Real life, right? Like, like civic life, right? If you can’t drive; if you’re in a rural or a remote location. And I think that’s a really helpful observation that this influx of people, or, you know, around the holidays or something is actually like aberrant is, is abnormal.

And the rest of the time these devices could be serving a really smart purpose. Or a really helpful purpose, rather. I wonder, though, when it comes to some of what is being seen—this is a separate part of this. It’s not just that when I hear these anecdotes that are reported that I am, or that they’re coming home and watching their loved ones be deeply embedded in their devices. A lot of the worry, too, is around what they are looking at, right?

This notion that they are scrolling on Facebook, you know, what me and my colleagues are calling “reel slop,” right? Like r-e-e-l. Where they’re seeing these AI-generated videos of things that are either, you know, misinforming them, or just strange and kind of detached from reality. And, like, really low quality, right?

Like, these aren’t the mitigations that you are talking about, where it’s allowing someone to play puzzle games that are sort of, you know, keeping their brain elastic. This is, like—kind of tuning everything out and just being washed over with low-quality slop content.

Is that a worry? This idea that the phones are helpful—and the connection is helpful and the tether is helpful—but what they’re seeing is potentially harmful, because it’s really low quality?

Vahia: It is a worry. And I think it’s real, and it’s consequential. So, the dark side to all of this screen news has a few different dimensions. I actually think the biggest one is that as older adults are spending more time on the phone, it’s getting easier for scammers to target them. And I think the screen-based scam targeting older adults—I think that is a real problem and a real threat. And with AI, it’s becoming even more sophisticated, because sometimes these scam tools can be really quite hard to distinguish from humans. Especially when the AI is talking to people. So I think that’s a risk. The slop is a risk too. Much has been said and written about misinformation in general, and older adults I think do tend to be a little bit more trusting of a technology that they adopt. I think that that innate skepticism isn’t always there.

And, again, the devil’s always in the details, right? If someone’s just scrolling through a social-media feed where they’re watching a video after the other, that’s a little bit different than two people forwarding content to each other. Or on a chat group, where there’s also communication and correspondence.

I think one of those things is—neither of them is great, but one of those is slightly better than the other. Because one of them involves interaction and communication, and the other one is just much more passive, which is less ideal.

Warzel: You know, participating in the same way, having sort of a panoply of options.

If you talk to younger people about their phones—and by younger people, I mean all the way up to, let’s say, 55, right? They’ll tend to complain about their use. They’ll talk about their doomscrolling, or I wanna get off this, or, It’s not helping me live my best life. But what are you hearing from older people that you meet with in terms of self-reporting? Are they worried about the time that they’re spending on their devices? Are they okay with it? How do people seem to feel about it?

Vahia: In preparation for this conversation, I kind of polled my colleagues. I work in a team with nine other aging and mental-health specialists. And I just told our team that, Have you seen this? Has anyone brought this up?

And the answer surprised me. That no one’s actually had any of their patients—and we see several hundred people—no one could really acknowledge or remember someone coming to them with problematic screen use as something to address. I think they were there for other things, and you sometimes uncovered a lot of screen use. But unlike, say, you know, substance use or alcohol use, or even things like gambling, we haven’t come across yet the issue of too much screen time as a bona fide problem that requires a mental-health professional. Others may have. So I think I’ll be watching the response to this to see if anyone can share a story. But we are seeing clear reports of more time being spent on the screen.

So, where my head’s at is—we are seeing people spending more time on their phone. But it’s not necessarily being thought of as a problem. And that’s interesting, isn’t it? Because if you’re spending way too much time doing something, you usually know when it’s a problem, versus when it’s not. And I see that as a signal that it’s probably got at least some benefits, or some positives.

Warzel: But do you think there’s also a literacy quality there? And what I mean by that is: Something I see from, especially, people in a younger generation than me—Gen Z, Gen Alpha—there is a real understanding, innately, having grown up around this technology, that they know they’re being manipulated at all times.

They know they’re being pushed by these algorithms into this thing. And there’s a frustration there, I think, because of just the understanding of the technology. It being so innate. Do you feel like maybe a little of this—maybe the lack of what you’re hearing on the end of the older people—comes from maybe not having that same media literacy? Understanding of the ways that the technologies work?

Vahia: I do think that that’s a part of it. But I also think it’s specific to this moment in time, and that digital literacy just takes time to trickle up the lifespan. So I think we are starting to see this shift. But these things are always going to start at the younger, more hyper-connected, more tech-literate generations, and then trickle up the age span.

There’s also the kinds of tech that older adults use. They tend to trust more mature, more subtle technologies rather than the latest, greatest thing. So, you know, most people are still happier about something like Facebook—which at this point counts as mature technology or at least a mature platform—and they’re less prone to whatever the newest ones are. Snapchat. We are paying attention to ChatGPT and sort of the new generative-AI models. I think a lot of people have their eyes on this, because every now and then we kinda see these leaps in tech adoption. So older adults historically were less prone to using computers. And by computers, I mean the classic desktops.

And then they were also—they used laptops a little bit more. But they were behind when cell phones emerged; they were not as quick to adopt cell phones. They were also slower to adopt smartphones. And then the tablets arrived, and that just seemed to mark this whole en masse onboarding of the technology because—it’s that Goldilocks phenomenon. iPads were just right. I think the screen was larger. The keys were larger. So just easier to type for people with sensory impairment or visual impairment. But also, they were so easy to use. You didn’t need to upload software; you didn’t need to download software. It was all kind of right there. You had to tap it. It was easy. So I think you see these generational leaps around ease and efficiency of use. And a lot of us believe that as these generative AI has gotten more—you know, as we’ve moved from typing to speaking, that’s marking a shift. It’s just so easy now, where you have a device and you tap in, and something is talking to you. And it talks back, and you can have a conversation.

So I think you have these like leaps every few generations of technology, and just simplicity of use. So I think we’re on the threshold of seeing a lot of change, as these voice-based AIs become commonplace.

Warzel: Are you seeing a lot of—just anecdotally—a lot of adoption of the voice-based AI?

Vahia: We are. We are. And, you know, it’s anxiety-provoking. Because I think it really brings all of the things that we’ve talked about to a head. That—I think it creates huge opportunities, but it also creates massive risks.

Warzel: Right. We recently had Kasmir Hill, a New York Times reporter, on the podcast, who’s done a lot of reporting around what people are informally calling “AI psychosis.” That’s not a medical definition, obviously, but this idea of problematic behaviors with chatbots. And something that she has noted, in the reporting that we talked a lot about, was this idea of the ways that these chatbots are so engaging, right? It’s not just that they mimic human nature and that they are conversing. Which I think—with someone who may be more isolated in general, or feeling like that—that is extremely attractive as a proposition.

But also this idea that they are prompting you to continue to engage, right? They are also sort of asking questions at the end of it. Wanting you to go further. And the more that people do engage, the higher the likelihood that you start to lose touch with what it is you are.

And this goes to people who are younger, too. This is happening sort of everywhere. The sooner you might lose touch with, Oh, I’m talking to a large language model, not a person, not a thing. Are you seeing any problematic examples of those interactions with chatbots? With some of the people that you’re seeing in the clinic?

Vahia: So personally, not yet. But it’s a matter of time. Because the thing that I’m nervous about is that bots—it’s that validation function. They rarely contradict during conversation. It’s more, it’s what you said. Like they’re designed to be facilitating, but they’re also designed to be validating. So a bot will not say no. A bot will say yes, but also if it wants to contradict.

And I think there’s a real risk there—that if someone has a question about something, and it’s risky. I’ll make up a ridiculous example. But, say, if an older adult were to ask their daughter, Should I send my bank-account information to this Nigerian prince? Their daughter would be, No. A bot might say, Well, that’s an interesting question. Here’s what you should know about this—that there is a scam like this, that maybe you should do this. Maybe you should do this. Maybe you should do that. And there’s a difference, qualitatively. Because one puts an end to a risky conversation, and the other may not put it quite as … sorry. One puts an end to the risky conversation, and the other may continue that conversation because it is designed to engage. And I think that is risky. Because that validation function, right? The bot rarely makes you feel bad by telling you you’re wrong. Even when it tells you you are wrong, it offers alternatives or other ways to continue the discussion.

Warzel: Well—and I think we, you know, should be clear here—or these purposes, that’s hypothetical. You know, it is possible these chatbots will—or that in some cases when you prompt them—will caution people against sending money to, you know, the theoretical Nigerian prince. But I get what you’re saying. Something you said earlier too, I think is very striking to this phenomenon. You know, I mentioned this, you know, short-form video-slop stuff that has historically been very prevalent on Facebook, and also Instagram. You mentioned that older people tend to adopt these more mature technologies, right? Like a Facebook. And I think what’s interesting as a technology reporter is that some of these younger, newer social platforms—they struggle with all kinds of emergent problems, but they’re also iterating out of them a little bit faster. Right? They’re sort of pushing the boundaries a little bit.

It’s interesting to me that you have these people who are on a platform like Facebook, that isn’t updating in the same way, right? Like it is happy to kind of keep that engagement. To not have those rules against, you know, these types of fake AI-slop images. And it feels, to me, like a danger that is not talked about enough potentially. That by not sort of evolving out of the platforms—like a Gen Z person might do—or being on the newest, latest, greatest thing that there is actually a little bit of this. Yeah, there is a danger of using an older platform that is not evolving in the same ways. Because then they get trapped with the lower-quality content. And I think that’s super fascinating.

Warzel: So one of the things that you’ve brought up here—that I think is one of the most salient points for people listening at home who may be dealing with an elderly relative or a loved one who they feel has a problematic relationship with some of their technology—is this idea that it can be really positive. That we should stop, pause, think about what role this is serving in their life.

You are in a clinic with people. You are using this technology in a way that is supposed to have positive interventions. Talk to me about some of the positives you’re seeing here with elders and technology use.

Vahia: So there’s many levels of it, right? The one thing I really try and emphasize is that you don’t have to always be using the most state-of-the-art, high-tech, fresh-off-the-lab tech.

There’s a strong case to be made for just teaching people to use well-established stuff. Properly. A very simple example is: I have people on our team whose job is to teach older adults how to use Uber and Lyft. Why? Because many of them don’t drive. Many of them are isolated. They’re used to calling a car service, or they’re used to calling for the ride. And of course these are benefits, not things they paid for. But, I mean, if I had a dollar for every time we showed someone how easy it is to call a car service that will take you anywhere. It can transform lives, food deliveries, and other examples.

So, you know, is it or is it not “technology” to teach someone how to use a widespread app? I would argue it is, because you are enhancing digital literacy, but you’re doing it around specific function. So some of it is just—people’s mood improves, people’s anxiety goes down. If you can simplify everyday functions that may be a challenge for them.

Warzel: What about in general? I mean, like, there’s those apps that help. But I think, you know, are you seeing positive effects with the social-media use?

Vahia: We can. But it depends on which social-media use. So, a big one is just text messaging, or things like WhatsApp or the Messenger apps. Why? Because if people’s social-media uses anchored around interaction and communication—rather than just the passive consumption of content—that’s a different thing. It’s sort of what I alluded to earlier. That in my family, I have people that—it’s actually quite specific to WhatsApp, that there are people on multiple WhatsApp groups just forwarding what you might consider slop. But it’s one thing to scroll by yourself in your room to watch slop. And it’s another thing to forward slop to each other. And then talk about that slop—whether it be “Is this real?” or “This is so stupid; what do you think?” So there is almost always value in interaction and communication.

I think in-person’s better … but in-person is not always an option, right? And so, you know, slop—when consumed in isolation—I think is almost universally a problem. Slop as giving people a common thing to talk about, that might not have too many common things to talk about? Now that’s a little more nuance, isn’t it?

That’s a little more positive. We know art therapy works. We know music therapy works. But very few people can play an instrument or draw. But if you give them an app that’s equalized artistic talent or musical skill, that’s a positive. So it’s not really about the tech; it’s about how you use it and how you apply it. And I think the art of digital medicine lies in that. The art of digital medicine, the art of digitally based psychiatry, the art of AI use lies in that. I’ll give you an example from an ongoing study, where we have a project where we are comparing a human geriatric-care manager versus an app that is trained on working with caregivers.

And this is all specific to dementia. Which is—it’s a very simple question. We generated, you know, a list of common caregiver questions. And we asked the same question to an AI chatbot and to a human geriatric-care manager. And then we did a third thing. We gave the human care manager access to the bot to see if they could come up with a hybrid answer.

But before we even get into what we found, the biggest finding was that it took our human six weeks to answer all the questions and compose their responses. It took the bot 13 minutes. And a lot of us sort of picked up on the fact that—even though we would not really question that you want a human resource, you want someone to help really work through whatever it is that ails you—the truth is, our human is not going to be available for a three-hour conversation at 11:30 in the night. AI is.

And AI is close enough to the … it’s not perfect, but there is something to be said for efficiency and access. I’m not saying it’s right. I’m saying you can’t discount it.

Warzel: All of that is so conflicting to me.

It’s right, because in one sense, I was kind of laughing earlier. Because of this notion of art therapy, music therapy … and then slop therapy, right? Like, sending it around to others and being connected. And I think that’s important, because it adds a rub to, you know, we look at somebody sort of canonically. There’s this … I don’t know if you’ve heard of Shrimp Jesus. Have you heard of Shrimp Jesus?

Vahia: I don’t think I’ve heard of Shrimp Jesus.

Warzel: Okay. It’s an AI-slop representation of this Christlike figure, but it’s a shrimp. And it was one of the early versions of AI slop that was very popular. And it seemed like … it was not fooling, but sort of bewildering, a lot of elderly Facebook users. Something like that. Anyway, those things are always presented as awful, right? That there’s somebody, they’re like brain rotting instead of generative in any way.

And I think that we have reflexively—especially someone like myself, a technology reporter—have classified something like slop as bad, right? You’re not gaining anything from it. And yet, what you’re asking people to consider is that, just as a meme—as a thing to trade back and forth, a building block of conversation, however silly it may be—or in general, if it’s fostering that kind of tether and that connection, I think that it’s important. And so that’s kind of confounding to think about. Something I wanted to ask you is: I feel like there is this idea that the technology is very helpful to people when it tethers them to reality, right?

Isolation. Loneliness. But I think what we’re also seeing, at the same time, is some of this tech, some of what they’re consuming is actually distancing them from reality. It’s blurring the lines of what is real. So you have this thing, it feels like two things are happening at once, right? Almost at the exact same time. Do you agree with that?

Vahia: I do. I do. And I think that conflict that you’re feeling, that confusion. That asking of, Well, which is it? Is it good or is it bad?

Vahia: That’s actually the appropriate response, because nobody knows. But I think there are some guardrails to this, because the real answer is not, “Nobody knows.” But the real answer is, “It depends.” It depends on the person; it depends on the situation; it depends on the circumstance. I get asked all the time—you know, we now have therapy chatbots. And I get asked all the time—am I worried that these things are going to take away human jobs? And I don’t think so. In fact, I think it’s really sharpening the human effect. And I think it’s very close to what you said. That on the one hand, people value technology that tethers them to reality. But there’s also an untethering. And that’s exactly right, isn’t it? I think that the human function there is to then find the tethering, and to prevent that disconnection and that confusion.

And sometimes it’s as simple as acknowledging the confusion to begin with. We react poorly to ambiguity. I think there is this preference for clarity, and sometimes all we have to do is help people hold their ambiguity. But then do it while giving them some tools around how to then remain connected.

So: brain rot, slop. I think no one would argue … that’s probably not a good thing. But if brain-rot slop is giving you something to talk to people, preferably in the same room and face to face, and if you’re older? If it’s giving you something to laugh at, or something to at least make sure that everyone else is just as puzzled about it as you are? And then maybe it gives you an excuse to call up your grandchild and say, Well, what the hell is this thing? It makes no sense. Then, something positive has sprouted from that slop.

And, I think in many ways, I think there is a certain collective responsibility not to be absorbed by all of this—but to absorb it instead and assimilate AI as a piece that can promote. And this is all very Pollyanna. I’m not saying this is easy. I’m not saying this is how it’s going to go. This is messy, complicated stuff. But there is a reality where this can all be sort of leveraged into a collective positive.

Warzel: Yeah, my concern having covered this for a long time with the social platforms is that I think you’re right. And I would just want to say that I don’t want to paint with too broad a brush on this, and there could be these positive externalities from even the lowest-quality type of content. I think that’s something we all need to keep in mind. Where I worry—where I break a little bit from you is that these companies are generally very poor stewards of the regulations and the rules and the looking out for. And they do optimize for this engagement.

And if you have a segment of the population—be it 11-year-olds, or be it 84-year-olds who are showing signs of deeper and deeper engagement with a certain type of thing—the chances are it’s going to be fed to them at higher and higher rates. Right? And, that, to me is the concern. And that’s not on you, or that’s not on the people who are using this technology. That is, very simply, on people who are in charge of building and designing these platforms not serving their users properly. And that’s distinct from any kind of user behavior.

What I wanted to sort of end on here is: This episode’s going to come out during the holiday season. People are going to be at home. People are probably going to be experiencing this, we’ll call it a “phenomenon,” but just this experience of maybe seeing an older loved one immersed in a device. Maybe feeling a sense of concern. How do you suggest that people breach those conversations? And what should they be saying to someone if they do feel this way?

Vahia: Such a great question. I would say first—if you feel distress, see if you can hold it within you, and resist the temptation to jump to a conclusion about it. So don’t go, You’re spending too much time on the phone. Instead, perhaps ask, What are you watching on your phone?

What apps are you into? This is what I do with my phone. You could use their phone use as a conversation starter, as a way to meet them where they are, as a way to perhaps enter their world rather than expecting them to jump straight into your world. And, it can just be the basis of strengthening connection rather than breaking it.

But who among us responds well to being told whatever it is we are enjoying is wrong? Like, no one enjoys that. So, don’t do that if it bothers you. Fair game. But keep an open mind, and inquire and learn and assess what’s going on—rather than declaring it good or bad.

Warzel: I think it’s so smart that if we are talking about a behavior that seems to be isolating somebody, or seems to be drawing a human disconnect, that the appropriate way to respond to it is to connect with them, right? Not to disengage—or shame them in some way that may draw them further into their device, or further away from the loved ones in their life who they feel like they’re judging.

I think there’s something rather lovely about using this as an opportunity to foster the kind of connection that they may not be feeling. And that may be drawing them into that device.

Vahia: Yeah. It could be a reason to bond, rather than a reason to separate. Because we all bond over things we share in common. For better or worse, too much phone use is something we all share in common these days. Might as well use it.

Warzel: I think that’s a great place to end it. Dr. Vahia, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brain.

Vahia: Such a pleasure. Thank you for having me, Charlie, and for focusing on this. It matters.

            <div id="article-text">For those of us north of the equator, winter officially arrived last week. The early darkness and the chill in the air demand a change in our habits. For many, the season provokes an unmistakable turn inward—toward our warm homes, or the loved ones we see on holidays, or meditative thoughts that, in other times of year, might be crowded out by the light and noise of the world.

Perhaps saying so is sentimental, but these feel like the perfect days and nights for poetry. The form can capture, perhaps better than any other, the muffled quality of cold afternoons and days spent indoors. Its winding paths of language can describe both the season’s comforts and its harsher qualities. As 2025 winds down, we’ve selected some poetry to accompany you through the last days of December. Each collection speaks to a different wintry mood, but all are worth slowing down with before 2026 brings the return of longer, busier days.

Selected Poems of Rubén Darío, translated by Lysander Kemp

Once, after an epiphany in a high-school class, my best friend declared that she had made up her mind to study literature in college. This was years ago, but I remember that day well: She said that analyzing a Darío poem had made her realize how beautiful an arrangement of words can be. Many of his works double as fairy tales, and have been adapted into children’s books. This is why my first exposure to Darío, one of the best poets to ever write in Spanish, came when I was 3 or 4—in the form of a princess story that I love just as much now. My father, too, can recite from memory a Darío verse he read as a young man: “and the neck of the great white swan that questions me.” This volume of Kemp’s translations includes my favorite Darío poems; their rhymes are lost, but their dreamlike, hypnotic quality is preserved. And the sensual images these verses bring to mind—nightingales and angels and silks—make this collection ideal for evenings beside the hearth.  — Gisela Salim-Peyer

On a snowy day, you could curl up by the fire with something wholesome and cozy; you could perch by the window with something chilly and somber. Or you could crack open the New Zealand poet Tayi Tibble’s Rangikura, which is none of these things. Playful, forceful, and sexy, it radiates so much heat that choosing it for a holiday read is like fleeing south for the winter. (And in Tibble’s home country, December is summer.) That’s not to say it’s unserious: Tibble reflects on the relentless shame she used to feel about her gender and her Indigenous Māori heritage; she charts how she emerged from timidity like flowers peeking out from a melting blanket of ice. Rangikura is the result of her transformation, and it is a persuasive case for freedom, pleasure, and fun that honors the generations of women in her family who also celebrated, shouted, and danced. “I’m hotter than the sun,” she declares. “And my ancestors ride wit me / like dawgs. When I whistle / they run and run and run.”  — Faith Hill

In her diary-like, book-length poem, Midwinter Day, Mayer sets out “to tell the story of exactly what is happening.” The book duly follows a course from her waking hours to the “long black night” of the winter solstice. In the middle of the book, she stops to note the time: “It’s 1:15 pm,” she writes, as she leaves the market. “We’re going home with what we can have to carry. / Having had to pay for it / And the sun comes out.” Mayer isn’t the first author to turn a single day into her plot, but her loving transcription of life in 1978 Lennox, Massachusetts—her children drawing at the kitchen table, their visit to the library, the pattern of snow Mayer sees on a roof, the red brake lights that shine on the wet street—makes a string of ordinary events feel like quiet epiphanies.  — Walt Hunter

Sullivan’s poems are so long that only six appear in her books. Half of these are in her 2018 debut, Three Poems, and the other half appear in her follow-up, Was It for This, which juxtaposes an elegy for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire with two gratitude-laced meditations on aging. Throughout, the depth and quality of Sullivan’s attention to prosaic detail—even plain and unappealing objects—never wavers. She lingers on microwavable “corn cobettes”; on a crumbling library book that turns into an “osteoporotic spine / all particles, frayed ribbon, / skin stubs, moving in the / light.” Such appreciative concentration is rare in this era of rush and scrolling, but in “Was It for This,” the collection’s most meditative poem, Sullivan writes, “The things that I instinctively saw as ugly I wanted to see also, under another aspect, as beautiful.” When I read her, I want that too.  — Lily Meyer

Lim’s searching book is best read in complete silence. It rewards the focused, careful turning over of words and phrases. And it is studded with winter imagery: “No clouds toppled across the snow wilderness. / No gloom-dark tree-glitter winding and twining its silks. / Blankness, egg-quiet,” she writes in “Wintering.” This book is dead serious about the human condition, determined to ask existential questions about life and willing to linger in its mysteries. Yet this ambivalence doesn’t show up in Lim’s syntax, which is sure-footed, precise, and vibrant. She begins one poem, “Certainty,” by referencing the Puritan poet Edward Taylor. His verse, she notes, is “full of deep piety, / learned and quiet, but sometimes an errant wildness runs under / the seams of his words.” The same could be said of the poems in Wilderness—they read like a long, slow breath after the crush of a hard year.  — Maya Chung

How successful is Crane’s modernist epic, a poem meant to stride as confidently across American geography and history as the mighty Brooklyn Bridge spans the East River? Nearly 100 years after its publication, the jury is still out. But even those who consider The Bridge a spectacular failure tend to be impressed by Crane’s ambitions. As T. S. Eliot does in The Waste Land, Crane wants to connect rapid, destabilizing change with mythic currents of emotion. He clasps Walt Whitman’s hand and briskly rouses Rip Van Winkle; all the while, he conjures trains and telegraph wires tearing across the country, buffeted by a hurricane of contemporary references. Making sense of all of this requires measured, deliberate reading, my ideal kind of project for the dead week between Christmas and New Year’s. Helping with this task is a fantastic annotated edition edited by Lawrence Kramer (which is being reissued this spring). Crane was a motivated, but frustrated, visionary. This makes him fascinating—and makes The Bridge worth the trek from promenade to promenade.  — Emma Sarappo

Glück, a Nobel laureate, was a poet of few and careful words. Her work is often described as “spare” or “austere”; a solitary aspect to her poems makes them the perfect companion after an early sunset. Glück often directs her focus toward self-reflection, but her second collection, The House on Marshland, also scrutinizes a stark, chilly natural realm marked by “the barrenness / of harvest or pestilence.” The opening poem, “All Hallows,” is sublimely, high-mindedly eerie, and it is one of my favorites. In later poems, Glück includes plenty of flowering trees and signs of new life, but those are freighted with warning: As she writes of spring, “with the first leaves / all that is deadly enters the world.” Perhaps there’s comfort to be found in the stillness and blankness of winter.  — Quinta Jurecic

The Complete Poems of John Keats, by John Keats

Some of Keats’s best poems brim with references to the seasons and their attributes, whether a spring musk rose, “mid-May’s eldest child,” or the “mists and mellow fruitfulness” of autumn. But picking up the 19th-century Romantic at the end of the year feels especially apt. That’s because Keats, who died at just 25, was obsessed with the finality of things, with an unavoidable fear of life ceasing to be. Reading him this season can be a humbling reminder of our finitude. And yet, his descriptions of winter’s “pale misfeature” or of “drear nighted December”—its ability to make him wonder, “were there ever any / Writh’d not of passed joy?”—are wildly alive; they suggest that there is much to be gained by reflecting on loss. With this poet, even musings on mortality point toward beauty, no matter the month.  — Luis Parrales

            <div id="article-text">The approach of a new year is an opportunity to reflect on time spent with friends, family, and partners who have played a role in your life—and how you can improve these relationships.

For parents, 2025 might have been a year that felt fraught with questions about what it means to raise a child today. In 2025, Atlantic writers explored the challenges that can come with finding child care, the debate about whether to avoid ultra-processed foods, the questions of when—or where—kids should gain access to technology, and more.

Dating, a once classic rite of passage, is also changing, Faith Hill wrote this year. Yet even as fewer young people are getting into relationships, they do believe in love: According to one study that included more than 5,000 Americans, 60 percent of single adults said they believe in love at first sight, a nearly 30 percent increase from 2014.

With a new year comes the hope of change and betterment—so let these writers help you nurture and strengthen your relationships in the year ahead.

            <div id="article-text">When the Chinese cargo freighter Istanbul Bridge set sail for Europe in late September, it took an unusual route. Instead of heading south for the 40-day voyage through the Suez Canal, it tacked north. The freighter arrived in the United Kingdom at the port of Felixstowe just 20 days later—successfully launching the first-ever Arctic commercial-container route from Asia to Europe.

For most of human history, the surface of the world’s northernmost ocean has been largely frozen. Now scientists predict that most of the Arctic Ocean’s 6.1 million square miles may be seasonally ice-free as soon as 2050. Economically, a less icy Arctic spells opportunity—new shipping routes and untapped fossil-fuel reserves. Climatologically, it’s a calamity. Legally, it’s a problem that has to be solved.

Much of the ocean’s center, the northernmost stretch surrounding the pole, will be subject to the lawlessness of the high seas—which will become a problem as more ships try to navigate a mushy mix of water and sea ice. And although the Arctic is the world’s fastest-warming region, and contains its most rapidly acidifiying ocean, it has few environmental protections. Scientists don’t have a clear idea of which species might need defending, or of the climate effects of unbridled shipping. (Ships puff black carbon, which reduces ice reflectivity and, in the short term, causes up to 1,500 times more warming than carbon dioxide.)

In October, the United Nation’s special envoy for the ocean, Peter Thomson, called for countries to agree to a “precautionary pause on new economic activities in the Central Arctic Ocean” to buy time to study the climate and environmental risks of increased activity. Others are asking for an agreement akin to the 2020 Artemis Accords, which committed 59 nations to the “peaceful” and “sustainable” exploration of space. But some polar-law scholars argue that curbing climate catastrophe may require a more radical reimagining: to make sea ice a legal person.

For centuries of seafaring, ice was an obstacle blocking people out, not an environment anyone thought to protect. Even in the Arctic, “we have laws about the land, we have the Law of the Sea, but we don’t have laws about ice,” Apostolos Tsiouvalas, a postdoctoral researcher with the Arctic University of Norway, told me. Because dealing with ice hasn’t been a major concern, even for the five nations that border the Arctic, and because ice is always transforming, its place in the law is confused at best.

In many cases, solid ice extending from a coastline has been treated as legal land, and ice carried by a current has been considered water. During the Cold War, both Russia and the United States maintained scientific “drift stations” on detached ice floes. In 1970, when a shooting occurred on one American station, several nations debated where, exactly, the crime took place. Was the ice Canadian, because it likely calved from a glacier on Canada’s coast? Was it an American island? After some back-and-forth, the vessel-size chunk of ice legally transformed—by no small imaginative leap—into an American ship.

The so-called Arctic Exception of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea does extend states’ rights to impose laws far from the coastline, in areas that are ice-covered for most of the year. The point was for Arctic states to help prevent accidents and pollution, but states have since used the exception to extend their geographical sovereignty. But the term ice-covered complicates these claims. How much ice means “covered”? Are we talking uncrossably frozen, or just a few drifting bits?

That’s the problem with regulating icy regions: Even if these cryo-categories were more formalized, none would apply for very long. A large majority of Arctic ice is sea ice, which forms on ocean surfaces when salt water freezes. (It’s distinct from icebergs, which calve from landbound glaciers.) Human activity may have accelerated its melt, but sea ice was already one of the planet’s most dynamic systems, its surface area fluctuating by millions of miles season to season. It’s always either melting or freezing, and as it melts, its fragments can travel hundreds of miles along waves and currents.

In an article published this month in the journal The Yearbook of Polar Law, Tsiouvalas and his co-authors, Mana Tugend and Romain Chuffart, argue that piecemeal updates to current laws simply will never keep up with this fast-changing and threatened environment. Future governance of sea ice will require a transformation of some sort, and they argue that the clearest path forward is to bring the rights-of-nature movement to the high north.

Since Ecuador’s landmark 2008 constitutional protection of nature, Bolivia, India, New Zealand, and other countries across the world have made natural entities legal persons, or otherwise given them inviolable rights. The UCLA Law professor James Salzman, who has taught a class on nature’s rights, told me that this idea does not represent a single legal framework but that it does answer what he calls the “Lorax problem” of environmental law, referring to the Dr. Seuss character who claims to “speak for the trees.” Granting a voiceless entity legal personhood provides it with a representative to argue on its behalf.

With this designation, Tsiouvalas and his co-authors note, sea ice would get the highest legal status possible. In many cases, environmental protections can be bent to accommodate other, conflicting benefits to human society. But personhood grants an inherent right to exist that can’t be superseded. The new paper is mostly an ethical exploration and, the authors acknowledge, still just a stepping stone to more concrete regulations, but granting ice rights would create firmer standing to, for example, keep ships out of areas that humanity might otherwise want to use. The authors also note that rethinking sea ice’s status could include Indigenous people who have been routinely excluded from decisions around Arctic sovereignty and whose millennia of living on and with ice could guide its future governance.

But Sara Olsvig, the chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, told me recently that the legal interest in Arctic rights of nature is a “worrying development.” To Olsvig, the phrase rights of nature itself implies some separate concept of nature that doesn’t exist for the Inuit. And in the past, the environmentalist movement has elevated its idea of “nature” above the interests of Indigenous people. Decades-long bans against whale and seal hunting, for instance, devastated the cultural continuity and health of Inuit in the far north.

To answer such concerns, any legal right granted needs to be very clear about the duties that follow, Salzman said: If sea ice has a right to not be harmed, what constitutes “harm”? Would that mean blocking all human interference with the ice, or merely banning fuels that emit black carbon? After all, the major threat to sea ice—global emissions—“is not something that can be locally managed,” Salzman pointed out, and so far, natural resources have obtained legal personhood only in a national context. Rights for sea ice would require international agreement, which could be not only harder to achieve but harder to enforce. Sara Ross, an associate law professor at Dalhousie University, in Canada, told me that, in her view, legal personhood granted via international treaty would be too dependent on goodwill agreements to be effective.

But in some ways, legal personhood for nonhumans is an old idea, Ross said. Most countries grant it to corporations, and in the United States and Commonwealth countries, it’s typical for ships too. She especially likes the ship comparison, because—as maritime law has already discovered—floating pieces of ice aren’t so dissimilar. She imagines a more circumscribed role for sea-ice personhood, connected to, say, setting standards that ban icebreaking or heavy fuel emissions in icy areas. If these mandates are violated, local Inuit communities would have the power to sue on behalf of the ice—whether or not they could prove how much one particular ship degraded one particular stretch of ice.

Without some legal protections put in place, the sea ice will soon disappear that much faster. In October, the U.S. bought new icebreaking ships from Finland and undermined an International Maritime Organization agreement that would have had shipowners pay a fee for the greenhouse gases their vessels emit. The next week, just after the conclusion of the Istanbul Bridge’s voyage, Russia and China made a formal agreement to co-develop the Northern Sea Route that the ship had followed. If summer sea ice disappears entirely, scientists predict accelerated catastrophe—leaps in temperature, more frequent and stronger storms, global sea-level rise—which will threaten the planet’s general livability. “The fact that we need sea ice to survive is not a rights-of-nature argument,” Salzman said. “But it’s still a pretty good case to make.”</div>

            <h2>Aphoristic Intelligence Beats Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/aphorisms-artificial-intelligence/685406/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first aphorism I ever read was on the Quotable Quotes page of Reader’s Digest, one of only two publications available in my house growing up. (The other was Time magazine.) I must have been about 8 years old when I came across the following sentence by Gerald Burrill, then the Episcopal bishop of Chicago: The difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.

At the time, I had no idea what an aphorism was. I was just 8. And I had no idea what Gerald Burrill’s observation meant. But I knew there was something special about that sentence and the others I discovered on the Quotable Quotes page. I loved the puns, the paradoxes, the clever turns of phrase. And I was amazed at how such a compact statement could contain so much meaning.

As a kid, that aphorism stuck with me, even more so many years later when I finally understood what the bishop was getting at—that drudgery is a habit-forming enemy of joy, and that staying in a dead-end job leads nowhere. I’ve been obsessing about the respective depths of ruts and graves for more than 50 years now, wondering every morning whether I’m simply walking to work or slowly burying myself.

This is the awesome power of aphorisms, and it is what sets them apart from the trite sound bites of social-media influencers and the platitudes of self-help gurus: Aphorisms do not make you feel good about yourself. That Burrill saying doesn’t offer an easy fix or a neat solution. In fact, it doesn’t offer a fix or a solution at all. It is a great example of aphoristic intelligence at work. It makes us reconsider what we’re doing, or not doing, with our lives.

Take the familiar saying “Love means never having to say you’re sorry.” Apart from the inaccuracy—in my experience, love means having to say you’re sorry on a regular basis—this is not an aphorism, because it’s too easy. It induces complacency. It doesn’t make you think. Much more confrontational, much more provocative, and therefore much more aphoristic is this, from the Polish writer Magdalena Samozwaniec: Love is that short period of time when someone else holds the same opinion of us as we do of ourselves.

Lila Shroff: The people outsourcing their thinking to AI

Or this wry insight from the Harlem Renaissance writer Jean Toomer: People mistake their limitations for high standards. Or the wisdom in this cynical definition by the legendary humorist Ambrose Bierce:

Misfortune n. The kind of fortune that never misses.

Or the rueful truth of this observation by the 17th-century French aristocrat François, Duc de La Rochefoucauld:

How comes it that our memories are good enough to retain even the minutest details of what has befallen us, but not to recollect how many times we have recounted them to the same person?

In some ways, aphorisms are perfectly suited to our era of short-form communication. They’re concise, catchy, easily consumable. But so much of our discourse, online and IRL, is anti-aphoristic—rage bait, trash talk, knee-jerk toxicity, gauzy affirmations, hashtag claptrap. And now comes that upstart other AI, artificial intelligence, promising to reduce our cognitive loads to zero by proffering frictionless friendships and sycophantic agreeability, and doing all of our creative thinking for us.

Aphorisms are different. They are the antithesis of the half-baked hot take and nothing like the machine-made flattery that’s now permeating so many informational environments. A platitude is a placebo for the mind; an aphorism is a wake-up call. Aphorisms provoke debate; they don’t promote dogma. Though they’re short, aphorisms spur considered reflection, not Pavlovian partisanship. At a time when polarization is so amped up, aphorisms can serve as psychological circuit breakers, interrupting our comfortable assumptions and prodding us to open our minds, unclench our fists, and think for ourselves.

Have an important life decision to make? Heed the artist Jenny Holzer’s advice: Playing it safe can cause a lot of damage in the long run.

Holzer’s line is a cautionary tale about how taking no chances in your career, your relationships—your life—can ultimately be hazardous. Or consider this idea, from the French poet, painter, filmmaker, and boxing promoter Jean Cocteau: Mirrors would do well to reflect a little more before sending back images.

Cocteau’s aphorism is a quippy but bracing reminder to look at ourselves differently in order to see others differently.

Charlie Warzel: A tool that crushes creativity

Dealing with aging, impairment, and death; confronting adversity and struggling with relationships; working through creative blocks and personal challenges—all of these things are supposed to be hard! The difficulty is the point. Where artificial intelligence makes things that are supposed to be hard seem like they’re easy, aphoristic intelligence accepts that things that are supposed to be hard are, in fact, really hard. Aphorisms gleefully increase our cognitive loads by immersing us even further in the difficulty and reminding us of what’s at stake.

Many researchers studying AI warn that tools such as ChatGPT, if overused, may promote dependence on technology and potentially trigger what they call metacognitive laziness—delegating challenging tasks to external tools instead of learning and doing them ourselves. Equally if not more concerning is the risk of metaphysical laziness—delegating challenging existential tasks to external tools instead of learning and doing them ourselves.

If a chatbot is calling my elderly parent for me, offering me nothing but relentless affirmation and validation, and writing all my texts, emails, and thank-you notes (not to mention my poems, screenplays, and novels), then I have become a spectator to my own mental and emotional life. My critical and creative thinking withers, and the very nature of thinking itself shifts from introspection to outsourcing, from seeing the big picture to painting by numbers. As the Austrian aphorist Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach once put it: Those who were carried to a goal should not think they’ve reached it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who died in 2003, might be remembered most for his erudition. During his 25 years in the Senate, Moynihan often turned the legislative chamber into a lecture hall. “That man just got up and spoke for 45 minutes with no notes and no reference materials, and proceeded to delineate the entire history of the Panama Canal,” a fellow legislator once reported. The New York Democrat and Harvard professor wrote or edited 18 books—and many more articles—on topics including automobile safety, organized crime, federal architecture, international law, and government secrecy. But these efforts had little to do with how he won four elections to the Senate. Despite his quasi-British accent and bow ties, Moynihan always identified with the working class, and he came to resent the elites of his own party.

This perspective, informed by his tumultuous youth, fueled his political success far more than his intellect. It allowed him to understand the anger of working-class voters, many of whom were alienated by the left’s endorsement of affirmative action in the 1960s and its rejection of national pride after Vietnam.

Moynihan’s bitter criticisms of the party don’t provide a model for Democrats today; he was too often blinded by personal grievance. But his critiques prefigured, and help explain, some of the greatest challenges his party now faces. Moynihan chronicled the exodus of working-class voters from the left as it began. Today, as Democrats debate how to win them back, they would do well to remember what he saw and, no less important, what he didn’t.

Read: The Democrats’ working-class problem gets its close-up

The press typically described Moynihan’s life as a Horatio Alger tale, the same way he liked to tell it himself: A boy who shined shoes on the sidewalks of Manhattan rose to the halls of academia, then high office. But the real story was more complicated, and more painful.

Volatility defined Moynihan’s early life. Born into the middle class, he spent summers riding horses and caddying at a country club. When his father abandoned the family, they fell into poverty. The shoe-shining began at age 10 but ended when his mother remarried and they moved into a mansion in the New York suburbs. Two years later, divorce sent his family back to the city. Moynihan went to high school in Harlem, leaping on the rear of buses each morning to avoid the fare.

Over the next decade, Moynihan continued to cycle through social classes. After high school, he worked as a longshoreman on the piers of Manhattan’s west side while getting a free public education at City College. Then he joined the Navy, which sent him to training programs at Middlebury College and Tufts University. On weekends, he visited his friends’ country homes and made frantic trips back to the city to help his mother run a bar she had bought in a rough neighborhood.

Moynihan had reservations about his new social set, who he thought lacked the toughness and insight he’d been granted by his stint in poverty. As he wrote to a friend back home, many of them needed “a good swift kick in their blue blood asses.”

A Fulbright scholarship to the London School of Economics offered Moynihan an escape from his chaotic family life. In England, his later persona began to take shape. He wrote in his journal that he wanted to become like “an English novel character—full of stories and odd bits of fascinating info.” By the time he came back to the United States, he had adopted the manners of the British elite.

Moynihan made his start in politics soon after his return. While working in President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Labor Department, he produced an internal memorandum about what he described as a growing crisis in the Black community, marked by a decline in two-parent households and a rise in welfare cases. He wrote that “the situation may indeed have begun to feed on itself,” suggesting that poor Black Americans were becoming victims of their own culture. Notably, Moynihan reached this conclusion without having included any Black Americans in the research and writing process.

The Moynihan Report, as it became known, was publicly released in August 1965, shortly after the Watts riot in Los Angeles. Even though Moynihan had finished writing the document five months earlier, the press initially portrayed it as the administration’s explanation of the racial unrest; according to early coverage, the report blamed the riots on a “pathological” Black culture. Black Americans and many on the left were outraged. In their eyes, Moynihan was “blaming the victim.”

Moynihan thought—with some justification—that his critics presented a selective reading of the document, which also called for greater investment in Black communities. “Liberty and Equality are the twin ideals of American democracy. But they are not the same thing,” he observed early in the report. “The principal challenge of the next phase of the Negro revolution is to make certain that equality of results will now follow.” Elsewhere in the document, Moynihan wrote that “equality of opportunity almost insures inequality of results.” When a journalist asked if he was “proposing preferential treatment in the hiring of Negroes,” Moynihan replied: “I believe this country owes the American Negro his back wages, yes.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates from the October 2015 issue: The Black family in the age of mass incarceration

The report emerged during a hinge moment on the American left, which Moynihan had begun to discern at the start of the decade. In 1961, he depicted a growing rift among Democrats: On one side were the predominantly working-class “regulars,” and on the other were the upper-middle-class “reformers.” As Moynihan described them, regulars thought politics was about winning votes. Reformers thought it was about moral issues, such as democratizing the party and expanding civil rights.

Moynihan sided with the reformers yet came to believe that many of them were more concerned with signaling virtue than achieving results. Tammany Hall—the New York political machine that served as a stronghold of the regulars—may have been corrupt and self-interested, but Moynihan admired its tangible service to the poor, such as its Thanksgiving tradition of delivering turkeys to needy families. He thought the reformers, by contrast, were too far removed from the lives of working-class Americans, which he never stopped admiring. (He would later write that he felt like “I haven’t really done a day’s work since” he was a longshoreman.)

In the years after the Moynihan Report was published, reformers and other elite liberals accounted for some of its most intense criticism. They had been gaining power within the party throughout the ’60s, as the Democrats went from the home of southern segregationists to that of civil-rights leaders. In 1967, Moynihan acknowledged that the “liberal Left” had enabled the “extraordinary impact and success” of the civil-rights movement, serving as a “secular conscience” for America. But he also thought the faction could be “as rigid and destructive as any force in American life,” an assessment based largely on the reformers’ rejection of his report. Moynihan grew more partial to the regulars, struggling to see that the civil-rights victories he supported were made possible precisely because the group—and its self-serving patronage system—had lost sway.

By 1968, Moynihan was lamenting that the working and middle classes “have been abandoned, and our politics are very much the worse for it.” The next year, Moynihan shocked Democrats by going to work for President Richard Nixon. Although Moynihan had previously endorsed affirmative action, he had come to believe that no overtly race-based policy could win enough support from groups such as the white working class. So Moynihan persuaded Nixon to propose a guaranteed income for all families regardless of race (which Congress never passed). In 1973, during a brief stint as an ambassador in Gerald Ford’s administration, he complained that he was effectively “silenced” on the topic of civil rights—“a considerable waste,” he wrote in his journal, “for I am really pretty good on the subject, and care as much or more than most people.”

Moynihan’s resentments fueled his belief that the privilege of many elite liberals skewed their vision of politics. Unlike ordinary people who tended to favor incremental reform over revolutionary change, the “liberal Left,” he wrote, was “largely made up of individuals who have passed through most of the stages of routine affluence” and “now want out” of the U.S. they knew. Moynihan thought that most Americans, Black Americans included, wanted “in.”

Much of the growing anti-American sentiment at the time was inspired by the Vietnam War, which horrified many on the left. Moynihan opposed the conflict, but he was quick to point out that elite liberals in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations were the ones who had started it—and members of the working class were mainly the ones fighting it.

Ever the contrarian, Moynihan embraced patriotism. In 1975, he published an article arguing that the U.S. should stop apologizing for itself in the aftermath of Vietnam, and start challenging its critics at the United Nations and elsewhere. He told a friend that the essay received a more positive response than anything he’d ever written. “The message is unmistakable,” he concluded. “People are tired of being ashamed of ourselves.”

Daniel Patrick Moynihan from the July 1975 issue: How much does freedom matter?

One admirer of the essay was Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who helped persuade President Ford to appoint Moynihan as ambassador to the UN. In that role, Moynihan delivered impassioned speeches in support of the U.S. and its values. Many working-class New Yorkers loved his theatrics; one of his friends recalled taxi drivers cheering Moynihan as he walked around Manhattan.

Buoyed by his new popularity, Moynihan ran for Senate as a Democrat in 1976. But he still didn’t let go of his resentment of elites. In the lead-up to the election, Moynihan sat for a tense interview with Timothy Crouse, a reporter from Rolling Stone. The two spoke at Harvard, where Crouse had graduated and Moynihan was teaching. At one point, Crouse asked Moynihan why he had chosen to work in academia instead of a more lucrative field, given his precarious youth.

“What sort of background do you come from?” Moynihan replied.

“Aaaaaahh … a rich Harvard kid. Or as we used to say where I came from, a rich college fuck.”

If anything, such a sentiment may have boosted Moynihan’s chances in the race. Despite his previous work for Republican presidents, he managed to secure the Democratic nomination, defeating his more liberal opponent by a mere 10,000 votes, thanks in part to reportedly strong support among working-class voters. He went on to win the general election handily, running a campaign that espoused an unapologetic patriotism.

In his report a decade earlier, Moynihan had attempted to reckon with the country’s history of racial inequality. By the time he ran for Senate, he had learned that pride won more votes than shame.

In the age of MAGA, Moynihan has been described as an avatar of a bygone era. The New York Times dubbed him “the anti-Trump of American politics” in 2018. Somewhat more recently, The New Yorker argued that Moynihan was “above all, a public-policy intellectual” whose “addiction to complexity” would make him out of place today. But these analyses present a blinkered view of both Moynihan and American history.

Moynihan does not belong to some distant past. America is still experiencing the effects of the liberation movements that began in the 1960s, and the battle that he chronicled between the regulars and reformers within his party has never entirely ended. Consider a telling moment from last year’s election: When Joe Biden was pressured to withdraw from the race, the working-class Democrat referred to his intraparty opponents as the “elites.” That was no accident; it reflected a long-running divide on the left.

As in Moynihan’s time, some Democrats now argue that their party should pivot back to the working class. Others want to pursue a more expansive progressivism, unconstrained by concerns about the political center. Both sides seem to think that their only hope of defeating Trumpism is to decide the debate once and for all. If Moynihan’s career is any indication, they shouldn’t expect that to happen anytime soon.</div>

Yep. It&#39;s also why I never share my projects projects in public repos. Doing so it&#39;s just a way of letting someone else steal your work for free.

People who made the mess, cleaning the mess, and charging for it.

Indian IT didn&#39;t make this mess. But they&#39;ve spent enough time walking behind their sacred cows that they recognize what&#39;s coming. And they are ready to do the needful.

This mess was brought to you by the big money boys who dream of ordering robot slaves around and dispensing with those nasty humans with their own minds and desires and plans.

This is Nadella, Pichai, Zuckerbook, along with Musk, Andreesen and the rest of the Valley Nazi clowns.

The hope was that AI would replace shitty Indian IT, but instead companies are laying off Americans and hoping to do more engineering in India. Often led by Indian management pushes.

Great, and then after the Indians botch it all to hell companies will have to look to us natives to ACTUALLY fix it.

cool, I guess...but I&#39;ve seen this show before and it sucked the first time around.

Hypemongers and lying salesweasels convince clueless executives to deploy immature tech with predictable results.Future AI may do some of the stuff promised by the hypemongers, but today&#39;s AI should be used in closely monitored experiments, far from production systems

to clean up the mess made by Indian IT firms trying to clean up the AI mess.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are some talented developers from India, they just don&#39;t work for the IT outsourcing companies.

&quot;AI mess cleanup&quot; seems to be really good business these days. But as soon as the whole insanity collapses, these people may be looking for a job as well. Unless they can pivot from fixing code to writing code. Which I sort-of doubt with the generally bad coder competence found in Indian outsourcing. (Not, I am not being racist. I just know that good coders in India leave the county or do other things than these generic services. Explained to me by two guest students from India.) Same for sysadmin services.

So when does everyone think this AI bubble is going to burst? Personally, I plan to do some major shifts in my 401k come the new year as while I&#39;ve seen some great gains lately I feel like we don&#39;t have much time left until the crash happens.

You are at least 100 years early on expecting this to happen.   We still don&#39;t have AI replacing the majority of jobs.   We don&#39;t even have AI call centers replacing the customer service people.   So, while a lot of potential is there, AI isn&#39;t killing too many jobs YET.   It will take at least 20-50 years before robotics will be replacing the workers at Amazon in the warehouses.   So, right now, it&#39;s all hype based on the potential for AI, and yet, it&#39;s causing problems with water, electricity, and other t

Bursting of the bubble will not be the end of money,but money alone might be less worth,and I would say when the bubble bursts,we will have a bank run.

Because this bubble and inflated stocks are built on debt,so its Lehman Bros. again .. or in this case &quot;trust me ai Bro.&quot;

Food reserves, drinking water reserves, dish washer soap,DIY energy and so on is important.

I forgot to mention the bubble will not burst,it has already started to burst, so it will be a very quick trickle down.

My indicator of the beginning -> Oracle Stock, since October 2025a very sharp decline.

I would say this is likely to happen.It all depends on the judgement for a company if the company provides a &quot;real&quot; value - in the &quot;old sense&quot;.

However these current companies with a real value core will shrink quite substantial.

I compared that just recently in a discussion with collegues to the &quot;Deutsche Telekom&quot;(*) from the 2000s, its also still around, but it has cost many people of their savings - due to their new found interest in the stock market.

Using the 2000s and the 2008s as a base scheme, many com

I&#39;d stay invested in the big players until small players start going bankrupt, I think. Companies like Google, Microsoft, etc. that act as cloud providers for small AI companies will continue to see money coming in right up until the end. And once AI pulls back, they are still left with valuable infrastructure.

The debt rating companies are usually behind in evaluating the creditworthiness of a company.

Debt rating companies have two near (?) conflict of interests:

1) The debt rating companies get paid by the company issuing the debt2) The debt rating companies want repeat customers and do not want to scare away other possible customers

The debt rating companies rarely update the credit rating of older debt issues as they do not earn a fee for doing so.

The lowest value a company can have is zero.  As corporate valuations increase along with inflation and other factors, that gap increases and it&#39;ll hold true for every step along the distribution.

A better way to put this might be something like &quot;Small companies are getting smaller&quot;.

You forget about debt, so companies can be worth less than $0.   Stock prices and &quot;market cap&quot; may have $0 being at the bottom though.

- The largest 10 stock exchange traded companies- The rest of the S&P 500- Everyone else

Nearly all of the revenue and earnings growth have been in the largest 10 companies, everyone else is either not really growing or shrinking.

The 25+ year business strategy of lots of companies has been to cut costs and slowly buy back stock.  That has led to stagnation and eventual decline.

Below inflation revenue growth included as well.

Trickle down economics causes more damage than Republicans want to admit.

Those aforementioned &quot;largest corporations&quot; are also doing that.

Small businesses have less reserves and react to the economy immediately.

Large ones take more time to react but can survive short term down terms due to their large piles of cash.

Also which are you calling small businesses - upto 50 or upto 500?  Those are radically different definitions used in that post.

Personally 50 or smaller is a large business, but 400 definitely seems like a mid sized company to me.  I would even say that if you employ 100 people, that is pushing it to call it small.  If you have tha

*correction:  50 or less is a small business.

We all know the story of the big company pushing out the small ones.  Now the major irony is the places and people that outcome most effects are in fact supporting policies that are accelerating that outcome.  We in America we like small business, we venerate it and I think on the net that&#39;s a good thing, we&#39;ve enjoy our entrepreneurial spirit but we also have to accept that left to &quot;the market&quot; alone most of them will be destroyed by the bigger companies and that&#39;s why we do in fact subsidize and protect s

On top of that if we really want to help small businesses let&#39;s stop them from having to provide health insurance

How would small businesses attract employees, then?  In the USA, you&#39;d be bonkers to take a job that doesn&#39;t provide health insurance.

Now, as it happens, I ran a profitable small business from 1999 through 2018---but in Canada, not the USA.  We have publicly-funded healthcare, so health insurance is not such a big issue, and it definitely helped my business compete with US businesses that ha

publicly-funded healthcare. I&#39;ll be more explicit next time but that was what I was getting at.  It&#39;s a silly thing to have to attract employees with.

Not silly as is it reality or not silly in that it shouldn&#39;t be.  That&#39;s a silly way to say that sir.  I am an American worker, I just had my open enrollment period, I&#39;m well aware of how silly it all is.

Half the nation votes to keep it that way, we&#39;re 15 years in and still arguing over whether the ACA was good or not.  Maybe this subsidy row will be a tipping point.  Republicans might dare to eliminate pre-existing condition requirements and then I think that might push enough people over.

Sorry, I do see your point. Yes, it is silly for American workers to be subjected to all of this. And I was also an American worker (retired now.)

Thank you for illustrating precisely why we have the fucked up system we have.

In the USA, you&#39;d be bonkers to take a job that doesn&#39;t provide health insurance.  Why? If you&#39;re healthy you don&#39;t need insurance.What if you develop a disease or get in an accident? Healthy people are not completely immune to bad stuff happening.In the decades I&#39;ve been working I can count on one hand the number of times I have needed to use insurance.  All that money I&#39;ve been paying has been wasted since the only way to get your money back is to be ill or get injured.Consider yourself lucky if the money you pay for insurance ends up being &quot;wasted.&quot;Instead of paying for insurance, that money can be given directly to you in the form of a higher salary.  You can then use that money for necessities or invest it so if something does happen to you you have the resources to pay for it.Alas, that kind of naïve thinking persists in the population. Very few of us have the resources to self-insure. Even wealthy people buy health insurance. Lack of health insurance threatens your net worth, not to mention your ability to pay for care.

Which is why everyone buys at Amazon, Wallmart, Costco, Home Depot, Starbucks, ...

And Congress&#39;s approval rating is 10% but everyone really loves their Congressman.  I guess should have said we say we care about small businesses.

People are driven by incentives but what we feel doesn&#39;t match reality, it&#39;s a tricky part of economics.  But at every Presidential debate or listen to any politician they&#39;ll talk about and be asked about small business.  News media interviews the owners, I guess we could say it really is just a virtue signal but let&#39;s face it a lot of people don&#39;t have the choic

The rich get richer, the big get bigger, the rest fight for scraps. This applies to nations also. China is the cheapest manufacturer of non-trivial products in part because everything is in one big metropolis: Guangzhou area. Specialists in anything related to manufacturing are just around the block. Tim Cook realized America can&#39;t match that without first matching it. Building a new local factory to supply special parts just for one customer (Apple) isn&#39;t economical. The same factory in China typically wou

Ever *read* Marx? He was right about all of it, because he was collecting data and describing what was in front of his eyes.His prescriptions to cure it failed only because they didn&#39;t scale.

The megamillionaires and the billionaires bought enough legislators to rig the tax system, so that they pay next to nothing. And then they make sure they only deal with other large companies... which is why family farms don&#39;t exist, and small, local eyeglass manufacturers and denture manufacturers and machine shops are

&quot;Pure&quot; socialism has yet to work well anywhere. Competition motivates people in ways altruism and platitude lectures can&#39;t. Thus, the best bet is to find a good mix of capitalism and socialism.

Read the article. There was no mention of the difference in variance between large and small firms, regarding hiring. Why is the important? Because if hiring of small firms has greater a variance than larger firms, than one would expect a greater deviation over time in hiring patterns. That is, it wouldn&#39;t be unusual to see small firms hiring less, at any given point in the data. If, however, the variance was very similar to each other, than it&#39;s far less likely to see this divergence.

More signs of a soft economy. This strikes me as scary because I really do think we&#39;re experiencing a major stock market bubble but usually with these big bubbles the whole economy gets a lift. We&#39;re not seeing that this time around which makes me think that when this current bubble bursts it&#39;s going to be especially bad for most of the economy. I guess we&#39;ll all see in the next couple years or so.

The current regime and the the US car makers will see to it.  They won&#39;t let these vehicles be imported. This is because of two things: Pride in things made in America by the current regime, and intense lobbying by the US car manufacturers.

The current regime likes ICE cars because consumers have to buy gasoline for them on a recurring basis. My theory is that they hate electric cars because with some solar panels, you can get the energy for them at a cost which the petroleum industry could never match.

The American car manufacturers have so overpriced their offerings that the average consumer making the median wage can&#39;t afford the cost of ownership for a new car. Have you seen all those 10 to 20 year cars with peeling top coats of paint being driven around. This tells you a lot about the state of car affordability in America.

When the rug is pulled out from beneath the US consumer (not a question of IF but WHEN) , there will be few customers who can afford American-built cars. At this point either consumers will retrench using pedal-assisted electric bicycles, or electric scooters, or they will allow Chinese EV&#39;s to be imported.

One of he big attractions in Cuba is all the old cars from the 60s. Tourists find it delightfully quaint.

Except this government also hates tourists.

My theory is that they hate electric cars because with some solar panels, you can get the energy for them at a cost which the petroleum industry could never match.I have always viewed their hate for electric cars as just a knee-jerk reaction to their political opponents supporting them.

There&#39;s also the issue of the software being used by the Chinese EV&#39;s. They could be used to spy on people by the Chinese government and the self-driving systems Chinese automakers use are nowhere as refined as what Tesla did with Autopilot and FSD.

The American car manufacturers have so overpriced their offerings that the average consumer making the median wage can&#39;t afford the cost of ownership for a new car.You came so close to getting it. The American cars are so expensive... but not because car manufacturers have an ability to dictate the car prices, they simply don&#39;t (COVID was exception due to supply issues). Cars are so expensive because of all the government requirements they have to meet. All of the cheap cars available elsewhere in the world would be illegal to sell in US. More so, iconic historic cars, like VW Beetle, would likewise be illegal to sell as new. Some of it due to emission standards, some of it due to safety and crash ratings, and some of it due to various historical tariffs (e.g. chicken tax [wikipedia.org]) and sales regulations. [wikipedia.org]  One of the key issues with EVs is that they are not affordable. Deregulation is how you solve this, not subsidies that are just transfer of wealth from everyone to well-off people that can afford to buy a new EV.

1. American cars have to be &quot;big&quot; because people won&#39;t buy them otherwise. Big means expensive.2. The $6,000 premium for the battery coupled with the costs of creating a true mass production line vs something more bespoke means that it&#39;s easier to start a luxury brand for EVs than a cheap car brand. That&#39;s why Tesla was successful, they were never creating a people&#39;s car, and d

And we have large cars because all the other cars on the road are large. And Americans won&#39;t buy small because in their eyes small is unsafe.Or maybe space is an actually desirable value.  I don&#39;t think it is really a case of people deep down wishing they could drive a small car if only everyone else did.

Here (New Zealand), where there are no subsidies, the Toyota Corolla and a similar BYD BEV are already the same price.  As the trend of dropping battery prices continues BEVs will increasingly become the cheaper unsubsidised option in more countries and market segment.

This is it, precisely.  If I could buy a new EV for $12K I would absolutely do that.  If buying a new EV means that I have to spend $60K then I am not remotely interested.  EV vehicles have some problems that make them impractical as the only vehicle for most families.  Those problems disappear completely if the vehicle is inexpensive enough so that it doesn&#39;t have to be your only vehicle.

To give you perspective, the most popular EV in China is Wuling MiniEV. It has the range of 100 miles and seats 2 people. The second most popular is Geely Xingyuan, it&#39;s a normal-sized 4-door car with 200 miles of range.

When the rug is pulled out from beneath the US consumer (not a question of IF but WHEN) , there will be few customers who can afford American-built cars.

I always thought that the EU&#39;s goal of phasing out all new internal combustion engines was attacking the wrong problem. The problems of climate change have not come from burning hydrocarbons per se, they have come from taking carbon-based fuels from the ground. We should phasing out the use of extracted oil for powering internal combustion engines and demanding that cars use air-to-liquid synthesised fuels instead.

There are currently somewhat over 260 million passenger cars in the EU, of which around 90%

Spending government time, effort and money on improving the synthesis of fuel from CO2 and water would help all of them. There&#39;s a reason this has never been demonstrated at scale though and at the end of the day the process is known but it requires gobs and gobs of energy input, like absurd amounts as you scale up.

We don&#39;t have to focus on 2.5 billion though, just focus on the market for 1 billion for now and then see whose left, those are easy gets and for that we just need more and cheaper EV&#39;s. Basically if it runs on petrol then it can probably be replaced with an EV. Passenger vehicles basically.

Where I think fuel synthesis could really shine is as a diesel replacement.  Big rigs, towing, heavy equipment, generators, stuff out in the boonies.  If we&#39;re worried about time to impact though synthesis is far more ou

Always left unsaid is the cost of replacing every ICE on the road, building out new generation and charging infrastructure, retooling all the automotive production lines, building new mines and processing for rare earths and new supply chains and battery factories.

This is going to cost many, many trillions of dollars.  Expensive should be considered in this context.

There is also the issue of EVs in difficult-to-reach places. Oil based products also have a very high amount of stored energy per kg so transporting them is economically feasible. So your point about banning the wrong thing makes sense to me.

The real issue to me is that EU car companies only lobbied for the end of the fuel ban because they want to make short/medium term profits for shareholders. Long term the companies will have to change tack anyway, just at a larger cost and behind all the rest. I think e

Remote places is a straw-man argument nobody is really making though, it&#39;s a rhetorical distraction that going to EVs has to be all-the-things-all-the-time-all-at-once, we&#39;re at like not even 10% of global vehicles yet?  There&#39;s massive markets that would be greatly served by EVs before you have to worry about the remote places since 90% of the worlds population lives in like the same 10% of the Earth, they can keep gas for awhile because they are a vast minority.

&quot;demanding that cars use air-to-liquid synthesised fuels instead. &quot;

I suggest you go take a look at the energy required. There&#39;s a reason nothing has yet supplanted fossil fuels - its because they&#39;re so energy dense. Unless you can magic up a 3-4x increase in grid power while will be entirely used up generating this stuff then its for the birds.

In a similar vein see: green hydrogen production.

>We should phasing out the use of extracted oil for powering internal combustion engines and demanding that cars use air-to-liquid synthesised fuels instead.

It is absolutely not feasible, technologically or economically, to produce enough synthetic fuel to meet current demand.

Even if the processes actually worked at industrial scales and could be rolled out quickly and widely enough to even make a dent in fossil fuel usage, you would need to to also build out the zero-carbon energy sources to run those processes. This means building roughly double the zero-carbon energy capacity that you&#39;d need if you just went straight to battery electric, and meeting all of the cost and logistical challenges that brings.

Synthetic fuels have a place, perhaps. I&#39;m a big believer in having multiple tools available so there are options to meet any challenge. But it is insane to talk about any one tool as &quot;the&quot; solution including synfuels. It is the opposite of productive.

Electrification of everything we possibly can is the only way forward. Not just passenger and commercial vehicles but also homes and industry. Every unit of energy we manage to convert to pure electric is two or three units of energy we won&#39;t have to waste trying to use some other renewable path such as synfuels or hydrogen or whatever.

> Banning the sale of new ICEs won&#39;t do anything for these nearly quarter billion existing vehicles

Nobody is claiming it would. The whole point is to force a transition over the next 20-ish years or so, which is still going to be a faster transition than attempting to replace gasoline and diesel with synfuels... because, again, it is simply just not feasible to do that.=Smidge=

Perhaps it will be an option in the future, but as I get older I also care less and less.

Presumably, they mean zero net emissions, which is possible. You completely combust all of the fuel in the car, a plant somewhere removes the combustion byproducts from the air and puts it back together as fuel, and the car burns that fuel. They would also need to break down the NOx to N2 or convert it to something long term stable.

It&#39;s essentially using the fuel as a battery.  For hard to electrify things like planes and rockets. You built enough renewable energy and normal storage to get your grid through

EV sales is already over 25% of the market in Europe. It is certainly going to be over 50% by 2030.

ICE is obsolete and as the boomers in love with it continue to die off EV adoption is going to go through the stratosphere.

ICE is doomed. You can&#39;t fight progress.Possibly one day, but not in my lifetime.  I&#39;ll pass on the need to win either right or left wing culture wars.

How much did they pay you for this propaganda piece?

1) Mention of big cities and calling them claustrophibic?   Most people prefer them - and the bigger the better.   And we choose what what/where/when/how we transport in these big cities - we just have MORE choices than those poor slobs in the hinterlands.

2) Killing an electical grid-point?  Wow, did AI come up with unrelated and unexplained propaganda?  Or is it a mistranslation from Russian/Chinese?

3) EV has nothing in it that allows government control.

Does the government choose what transportation a person uses, or does the individual chose ?  if it truly were down to your individual choice your only choice would be walking. or a horse, if one were around and you were strong, agile and skillful enough to catch and tame it yourself, that is, break its individual free choice to roam not giving a flying fig about your individual transportation.you do have more choice now, but only because a collective provided it for you. how? by some individuals limiting or manipulating the choice of other individuals. your sig conveys that quite accurately.there a

Retreating from electric cars will ultimately be suicide for US car makers. Electric cars are better in almost every way. In ten years, most people will come to understand this. Unfortunately, this understanding will come from people dying and not people changing their minds.Toyoda said BEV could satisfy the needs of maybe 30% of drivers.  The rest are satisfied by hybrids and ICE.  Toyota was criticized but they have been selling hybrids as fast as they can make them and their ICE sales are just fine. People buy vehicles that meet their needs best at a price they can afford.

People have different needs and many can be served by a cheaper, less capable device.  Buying a gaming PC to web surf is a waste.

You do realize that a simile only needs to be similar, right?  Gates eventually mentioned that the 640k was only intended for that specific market at that specific time.But that only makes the comparison more apt.  As technologies change, as the economy develops, things change.Today, I&#39;d estimate that 60% of people could go EV without problem.  80% if we only consider whether a given car could be replaced with an EV without extensive issue.Note: I don&#39;t consider installing a level 2 charger in a house an ex

If you think Gen-Z are big into EVs think again. They&#39;re quite happy with 2nd and 3rd hand ICE vehicles. If only 20-30% of the new car buying market wants EVs then someone has to supply the 70-80% ICE powered ones and it won&#39;t be the chinese.

All of those are quite reasonably solvable though and the only one that really matters it the cost of new batteries which is continuing to drop YoY and forecasted to get to $60k/wh by 2030 [goldmansachs.com] which is getting us to to where replacing your battery pack is on par with replacing your engine or transmission.

In the US, year over year sales of hybrid EVs (HEVs) are up 44%, sales of plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) are up 16.5%, and battery EVs (BEVs) are up 15.4%.  While the expectation from industry analysts is that BEV sales will rise at a much slower pace in 2026 and &#39;27, HEV and PHEV sales are expected to keep accelerating.  So it isn&#39;t as if electrification is in complete retreat in the US.

Also, some advances with BEVs are trickling down to new HEVs and PHEVs, especially with Korean, Japanese, and European brands

European cars are safer than American cars. Your premise that Chinese cars are both unsafe and will be &#39;fine&#39; for Europe demonstrates tremendous ignorance.

As you idea that &#39;magic technology&#39; is not on the horizon is again foolish.  AI cars are on the horizon and they would be viewed as magic when I learned to drive.  They are definitely safer than large cars.

There are lots of Americans willing to buy small cars.  You may not know them, but they do exist.  Many are poor and would rather save money than pay t

In interesting possibility is that EV&#39;s will become modular [olympianmotors.com] such that smaller firms and hobbyists can make vehicles customized for niche markets.

If they can manage the tricky safety issues associated with such, then the entire car market will be very different from what we are used to.

If they (BYD, Nio, etc.) get into our market -- which they&#39;re currently artificially limited from competing in (because, you know, free markets!), they&#39;re going eat our lunch.

I am ashamed of where we are headed on so many fronts.

Whether it&#39;s American or Chinese, Korean, or German, I don&#39;t give a shit.So the coddled, legislatively protected, and heavily lobbied US car industry dies. (shrug)

Don&#39;t we want non-competitive companies to die?  That&#39;s how capitalism IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.

No, the answer is to break them up. They should never have been allowed to become monopolies in the first place.

...expose and pop this damned AI bubble!? Jeez

I think we need to wait until either (1) Wall Street gets spooked about companies&#39; return on their AI investment, and/or (2) major investment funds lose a big chunk of money to AI. According to an op-ed in TheRegister, https://www.theregister.com/20... [theregister.com], (and I hope I&#39;m paraphrasing this correctly), most companies promoting their AI investment are merely buying some AI and then telling their proles to use it figuring they can then cut their workforce. However, that only makes the proles more productive, it does not eliminate roles. To do that, you must redo your internal processes to fit AI. Very few companies do that because that would be expensive. They want AI on the cheap, and it sounds good on quarterlies and to their boards.

To change the processes, it helps to start at the bottom and let it filter up, not establish some company-wide mandate to use it (or else).

That article also mentions something which I think is a killer. AI doesn&#39;t learn on its own. Let&#39;s presume this is true. To get around it, you must be constantly updating the model. To do that, you must constantly extract new information from your organization. But if your organization does not change, then your AI will not significantly change. And this is a recurring cost, not buy once and flog it forever to your investors, board, customers, etc.

It&#39;s not disputed that AI has some use, what&#39;s disputed is if all this AI infrastructure being built would be profitable without the market-share-grabbing subsidies in place now. Can it carry itself.

The early web likewise showed promise, but the first batch of dot-coms couldn&#39;t run a profitable business. It took market trial and error to solve this. And the economy got a bubble poppage while market Darwinian forces battled it out.

...expose and pop this damned AI bubble!? Jeez

The major problem here is Microsoft and Google, and the fact that we have given these two companies so much money by using their shit too much, so they have trillions in spare cash to spend on AI shit.

The AI bubble is Not a bubble as far as the chip manufacturers are concerned,  so long as Microsoft and Google keep spending insane amounts of money on datacenters - these companies have an opportunity to make massive bank.

The chip manufacturers simply have dollar

> [tech oligopolies] have trillions in spare cash to spend on AI shit.

True, but buying market-share usually eventually peters out, based on history.

> The chip manufacturers simply have dollar signs in their eyes, and they are obligated to do what&#39;s best to their investors. Which is screw consumers, so they can sell all their capacity to Google.

But if the AI bubble pops, they&#39;ll have to go back to consumer sales to survive. AI server farm construction would grind to a halt, meaning no more big chip pur

People think AI is a super-power, but most of it&#39;s gains are simply caused by people using better hardware.

The increasing cost of Memory may be the first of many limits that reduces AI&#39;s growth.  This may cause some disillusion in the fantasy that AI will become more than a College level intern.

64 bit processors have been around in x86 land since the Athlon 64 first came out in 2003, so and there will continue to be 32 bit distributions of Linux for at least another ten years.

That the populace is being subordinated by AI companies.

On Nov. 17, Abdallah Hadian, a civilian imam, strode into a state correctional facility in New York with a firearm. Moments later, he went into the administration building and placed the gun to his head.

Word of the 55-year-old imam’s suicide traveled nearly as quickly as the bullet that took his life.

In prison, no one bats an eye at hearing that an inmate killed themselves. This is especially true among fellow prisoners. Hearing that a fellow prisoner was stabbed to death, or overdosed, elicits a shrug, maybe a nervous laugh. Although we attribute such incidents to the violent and miserable nature of the place we inhabit, most people on the outside chalk these deaths up to the so-called mental health crisis inside correctional facilities, a phenomenon that gets significant attention. It adds to the unfair narrative of prisoners being bloodthirsty lunatics, a framing that benefits tough-on-crime politics.

As a prisoner, though, when you hear that a civilian staff member who left their family every day to go to the awful confines of prison—the same prison where Robert Brooks was murdered—took their own life in such a shocking fashion, it makes you wonder what we’re doing wrong. More importantly, the question swings in the air: What might someone who is living in the free world but considering killing themselves learn from prisoners about hanging on?

I’ve been there. I’m serving my 16th year for manslaughter. In 2009 a drunken argument with my girlfriend devolved into a physical altercation with deadly weapons. She stabbed me, I stabbed her, she died. I immediately attempted to end it all.

Obviously, I didn’t succeed. In the hospital, I soldiered through the physical misery of a collapsed lung. Then I wrestled with the shame and guilt of killing someone that I had loved, emotions that were all the more amplified when I was forced to relive the trauma in court. I’d be lying if I told you that I hadn’t contemplated every means of suicide.

I believe that I Iived through that awful and tragic experience to be held accountable, not only by the victim’s family but, less sympathetically, to the mirror. The pressures of life, which in that moment felt unbearable, proved bearable.

In my role as a journalist, I found purpose and draw from that dark place when reporting stories about characters who have their own dark encounters. I think it has enabled me to develop as a writer who draws out the humanity of prisoners that the tabloids leave behind. In interviewing the subjects of my stories, I always find myself threading our shared experiences into narratives pegged to universal themes like parenting, drug use, and—for obvious reasons a reoccurring motif—the feeling of the walls closing in. But the experience of isolation in prison is not monolithic.

Like most of the prisons I’ve had the displeasure of living in, Eastern NY Correctional Facility during the “happiest time of the year” offers no gifts under a Christmas tree. No “Happy Holidays” decorations. Just yellowed suicide-prevention memorandums posted on the bulletin board. Guys live here under the weight of life sentences and have been away from their families and loved ones for decades. Other guys haven’t gotten visits in years but still find reasons to wake up, to put both feet on the ground, and, oddly enough, even to smile.

I can’t help but admire the resiliency of old-timers, some of whom have lost every family member, who have more time in prison than I have on this earth. They keep it simple, play Scrabble or spades and talk shit. Once able-bodied men, they walk with canes, one step at a time.

It is the coping mechanisms of the prisoner, our survival under this added layer of extreme inhumanity, that may make us the most apt case studies for suicide prevention.

One day this season, I overheard some of the GED students inside our school building tell the prison’s acting educational supervisor, Nicole Cooke, that they didn’t have anything to be grateful for during the holidays.

“I didn’t like that,” she told me from behind a large wooden desk. This gave her an idea.

She had a tree painted on the wall, leaving the branches bare. Photocopied drawings of jars containing the words I’m thankful for were distributed to everyone who wanted to decorate the tree. She told guys to write what they were grateful for inside the paper jars, which stood in for the tree’s leaves.

Although the gratitude tree remained on the wall for about a month, as I attended my classes I walked right past it without reading a single jar.

The same day that I went inside the school building to finally put my own note on the gratitude tree, the jars had been taken down. I spoke with Cooke, and she removed them from her drawer and handed me the stack of paper jars. I sat down alone in the academic library and counted 82 altogether. I plucked through them one by one, reading their contents. Forty-six of them contained the word family or mi familia. Some included only a word or two, like mom or even Ms. Cooke. Suddenly, I realized that in my hands these small pieces of paper weighing next to nothing contained something so heavy and intimate—people and things that gave my community a sense of hope and purpose, reasons for living. I felt a little wrong riffling through them, but I was inspired to witness a collective will to live. As Albert Camus said, “Rarely is suicide committed through reflection.”

That’s when I noticed that a handful of these jars had been filled out by staff, people who, like Hadian, the imam, get to go home every day. Their end-of-year reflections had been displayed side by side with the prisoners’ jars on the tree: a shared message of thankfulness and hope displayed for everyone who took part or who bothered to look.

            <div id="article-text">This week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus is another entry in our occasional “Dear (Juris)Prudence” series, in which we invite listeners to ask their burning questions about the law and answer them as best we can. Write to amicus@slate.com to pose a question to Dahlia and Mark. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dear (Juris)Prudence,What does recovery look like for us as a nation? Even if we elect a Democratic president, House, and Senate in 2028, how can we legislate or otherwise repair the damage to the law, norms, precedent, etc., when we still have a Supreme Court that ignores law, norms, precedent, and maybe even the 14th Amendment?

Dahlia Lithwick: This is really an existential question as much as a legal one, but I know you’ve given it some thought.

Mark Joseph Stern: I think anyone who cares about salvaging American democracy needs to be asking those exact questions. And it’s pretty clear to me that the very first item on the agenda needs to be envisioning what the next Democratic president—let’s say, President AOC—should do in the first 24 hours of their time in office. That means embracing the maximalist vision of executive power that Trump has established to undo the damage that he is currently inflicting. Trump has amassed vast new powers for the president, and the next Democrat in the White House simply cannot surrender them. That would be unilateral disarmament, and a disservice to the country. What he or she needs to do instead is wield those powers aggressively for good, repair everything that’s broken, help the people Trump has hurt, and push forward with their own goals.

How does that cash out? First, let’s remember that the Supreme Court has now effectively granted the president authority to impound federal funds duly appropriated by Congress and to abolish federal agencies established and funded by Congress. I think that is terrible and anti-constitutional. But thanks to the Supreme Court, that is now the law. So let’s talk about what President AOC can do with those powers in 2029. On Day 1, she needs to impound ICE’s budget. She needs to refuse to spend the billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated to the agency and fire tens of thousands of immigration agents immediately, starting with those who committed acts of violence and discrimination—which, by that point, may be almost all of them. Close as many immigrant detention facilities as possible and free the detainees.

Then turn to Customs and Border Protection. Fire CBP chief Greg Bovino. Fire every single agent who participated in the horrific operations in Chicago, D.C., and L.A. Refuse to pay out a penny in benefits to any agent who broke the law. Release all the information about ICE and CBP’s immigration sweeps, including the names of every agent who participated. Start investigations and prosecutions of any law-breaking agent whom Trump doesn’t pardon. Repurpose the billions of dollars in savings as a reparations fund for every victim. Run the reparations program through a new agency established by executive order. Pay to return noncitizens who were wrongly deported back to the country. Transform ICE and CBP’s headquarters into the nerve center of a new Truth and Reconciliation Agency, and use this extra money to pay out damages to the victims of the mass deportation campaign. This would be 100 percent legal under the precedent established by Trump and the Supreme Court.

Remember: Trump has illegally fired tens of thousands of civil servants, closed agencies like USAID unilaterally, refused to pay out billions of dollars appropriated by Congress, halted our refugee program, shuttered the Education Department, paid reparations to Jan. 6 defendants and quite possibly himself. I think all of that should be illegal, but the Supreme Court has said that it is not. And you just cannot fight fire with a dripping faucet. So I say: Take these powers and use them to undo Trump’s legacy and really flood the zone. Blitz the country with these executive orders on Day 1 and dare anybody to stop you.

At the same time, the next Democratic president is going to be a “unitary executive” thanks to the Supreme Court. So purge every federal agency of Trump holdovers. Start with the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, every other formerly independent agency. Oust every single Trump appointee at any agency in the executive branch. The Supreme Court is about to let the president do that, and it needs to see the consequences of its actions when the president isn’t named Donald Trump. Take his name off the Kennedy Center, the Institute of Peace, and every other institution that he has illegally branded. This needs to be a top-to-bottom reconstruction of the executive branch using the precedents that Trump himself established. That is the only way a true recovery can begin, and that is what needs to happen within 24 hours of the next Democrat reentering the White House.

I want to hurl myself in front of one objection you’re going to get, which is: But then the Supreme Court’s going to say all of that is illegal! My response is: Good, that’ll take three years to litigate. Run out the clock in the million ways that we have learned that the clock can be run out. And if everything is enjoined on Day 1 by every single Trump judge and then the Supreme Court, then we have another conversation. But I absolutely agree: Democrats should not petition, hands outstretched to the Supreme Court, for the maximalist version of presidential power when it’s not Donald Trump in office. They need to say: Cool, this is what the rule is now. Let’s go.

The other thing I want to say is that baked into Jacob’s question is this issue of: How do we reinstate norms? How do we get the other side to abide by the entire complicated web of unenforceable feelings about, say, a separation between the Justice Department and the White House? And how prosecutors conduct themselves in court? And on and on? If we can learn any lesson from President Joseph Biden’s regime, it’s that you cannot simply adhere to norms and hope the other side will look around and say: Hey, I forgot—norms are awesome! That is not the way to go back to living under soft, unenforceable norms of democracy. You cannot bring a shrimp fork to a knife fight. We have to disabuse ourselves of that idea.

Because norms survive in a system like ours when both sides feel that they have something to gain from them and something to lose when they go away. And right now, under Trump, the Republican Party believes that it can only gain from shattering norms, because Democrats are too timid and afraid of their own shadow. And the only way to disabuse the GOP of that notion is to show them what happens to their side when the norms are gone. We cannot restore the norms magically by having one side abide by them. That would only make things worse by reiterating to the Republican Party that it might as well shatter any norms it wants because Democrats will just go back to abiding by them, even when they constrict the political fortunes and the power of Democratic lawmakers. It can’t work that way. It can only work if Democrats give Republicans a taste of their own medicine and remind them why the norms were there in the first place.

I often say that norms are not an end in themselves. Norms are a means to a larger end, which is a functioning democratic state. And the notion that we can rebuild a world of norms unilaterally is the enduring failure of the Biden administration.

            <h2>Stop the slop by disabling AI features in Chrome</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/26/disable_ai_features_chrome/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of today’s desktop web browsers come with a ton of built-in AI features, but the good news is that, in most cases, no one is forcing you to use them, and you can at least hide them from view. Removing the most egregious AI tools from Chrome is pretty simple, but it requires a few steps.

By default, a large Gemini button appears in the top-right area of the browser window, constantly trying to lure you into using Google’s chatbot. To hide it, right click on the button and select Unpin. Unfortunately, this doesn’t kill the keyboard shortcut (Alt + G on some platforms), which invokes Gemini, but there’s another way to make that happen.

If you want to do more than just hide Gemini, navigate to chrome://settings/ai/gemini. If you unpinned Gemini, you’ll see that “Show Gemini at the top of the browser” has been set to off. If not, toggle it off. Now, turn all the other switches off, including “Show Gemini in system tray and turn on keyboard shortcut” and “Page content sharing,” which sends content from your tabs to Gemini.

Google would really, really like you to use AI mode instead of its regular search. This type of search is a chatbot that returns direct answers instead of giving you a list of web resources. Perhaps it’s the future of all search, but if so, it’s a bleak future where publishers and content creators have their work hoovered up and plagiarized by a bot that may or may not give correct information and only occasionally cites sources.

To encourage you to use AI mode, Google has put an “AI mode” button on the right side of the Omnibox (what Chrome calls its address bar). So, when you enter a search query in the box, you can click this button to forgo regular search and send your question directly to AI mode. You can also use it by hitting Tab + Enter after entering your query.

It’s easy enough to just not click the AI Mode button, but perhaps for some folks, its very presence and the possibility of accidentally activating it is offensive. To disable the AI Mode button, first navigate to chrome://flags in your browser.

You should get at least three results. Most importantly, set “AI Mode Omnibox entrypoint” to &quot;Disabled&quot; so the button disappears. I also recommend enabling “AI Entrypoint Disabled on User Input” and disabling “Omnibox Allow AI Mode Matches” so you make sure the AI mode is hidden in other ways.

It’s not enough that Google Docs and Gmail both have built-in AI writing features. The Chocolate Factory also wants to help you write content that might go into text-based forms on the web. The Help me write feature activates when you right click on a text field and click “Help me write,” after which it pops up a menu to have you either start writing or make a request for it to compose a message for you.

However, sometimes I have also had the browser pop up a message trying to encourage me to use “Help me write” while I was typing into a text field, though I have not seen that behavior recently. You can make sure that it does not nag you to use “Help me write” by navigating to chrome://settings/ai/helpMeWrite and toggling “Offer writing help” to off.

On my browser, it was disabled by default, but Google also offers “History search, powered by AI,” which allows you to search your browser history, not just by the names of the pages you visited but also by their content. When this feature is enabled, it sends information about your browsing habits and the pages you query to Google.

To make sure that History Search is disabled, navigate to chrome://settings/ai/historySearch and toggle the single option to off.

By default, the Chrome Omnibox searches Google and returns results from its main search tab (aka the “All” tab). The main search tab on Google gives you web results as you would expect, but on many queries, an AI Overview appears on top of the page, forcing you to scroll down just to see actual listings from the Internet.

To purge AI Overviews from your Google search, you have a couple of options. First, you can install an extension called Bye Bye, Google AI, which I have personally written and can vouch for. It uses CSS to hide AI Overviews and, if you choose, can also hide Google-sponsored links, images, videos, and “people also ask” boxes.

If you don’t want to install an extension, you can configure your Chrome browser to search Google’s “Web” tab, which only shows results from the web, skipping AI Overviews as well as images, videos, and answer boxes. To set Chrome to search the web tab from the Omnibox, start by navigating to chrome://settings/searchEngines.

Click the Add button next to Site search.

Click the add button next to Site search - Click to enlarge

A dialog box appears. Fill in the fields as follows and then click the Add button.

Add Google (Web Only) site search - Click to enlarge

Click the … menu next to Google (Web Only) and select Make default.

From now on, when you search from the Omnibox, Chrome will send your query straight to the Web tab on Google, ensuring that you only get web pages without an AI Overview on top of them. ®

            <h2>From AI to analog, cybersecurity tabletop exercises look a little different this year</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/26/end_of_year_tabletop_exercises/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s the most wonderful time of the year … for corporate security bosses to run tabletop exercises, simulating a hypothetical cyberattack or other emergency, running through incident processes, and practicing responses to ensure preparedness if when a digital disaster occurs.

&quot;We&#39;re ultimately testing how resilient is the organization,&quot; said Palo Alto Networks Chief Security Intelligence Officer Wendi Whitmore in an interview with The Register. &quot;It&#39;s not if we get attacked, it&#39;s: How quickly do we respond and contain these attacks.&quot;

And this year, organizations need to account for the speed of AI, both in terms of how attackers use these tools to find and exploit bugs, and how defenders can use AI in their response.

&quot;Threat actors are exploiting CVEs at an increased rate with AI,&quot; Google Cloud&#39;s Office of the CISO Public Sector Advisor Enrique Alvarez told The Register. &quot;Tabletop exercises should consider a scenario where a CVE is published affecting a software system in use by the company with an immediate exploit via a cyber adversary.&quot;

Whitmore said her threat analysts see a vulnerability released with exploits attempted within five minutes.

&quot;On the defender side, like our own SOC: We&#39;re looking at 90 billion attack events coming in per day, which we can synthesize down into 26,000 that are correlated, and then one per day that requires human manual intervention of tier-three analysts to dive in, and run additional queries and analysis,&quot; she added.

Indeed, if 2025 taught us anything, it&#39;s that criminals and state-backed threat actors are increasingly adding AI to their arsenals, while enterprises&#39; AI use vastly expands their attack surface.

From the attackers&#39; side, this means more targeted, convincing phishing emails, faster reconnaissance and scanning for vulnerabilities, and troves of sensitive data that can be quickly scanned and stolen. Meanwhile, defenders need to ensure their LLMs aren&#39;t leaky, and AI agents aren&#39;t accessing data that they shouldn&#39;t have access to.

The Reg asked several incident responders to weigh in on best practices for these year-end tabletop exercises as they face more AI generated or assisted attacks, and take measures to secure their internal AI systems and models.

Tabletop exercises now need to reflect two realities: attackers using AI to move faster, quieter, and at massive scale, and attackers targeting the AI systems we deploy

&quot;Tabletop exercises now need to reflect two realities: attackers using AI to move faster, quieter, and at massive scale, and attackers targeting the AI systems we deploy,&quot; Tanmay Ganacharya, VP of Microsoft threat protection research, told The Register.

&quot;The best exercises simulate adaptive, AI-powered phishing and rapid moving attack chains, while also preparing teams for scenarios targeting AI systems like prompt injection, misconfiguration, and AI-driven data exfiltration,&quot; Ganacharya said. &quot;The goal is to rehearse faster decisions, verify information in low trust environments, and ensure teams understand how AI changes every stage of the kill chain.&quot;

Ultimately, the goal of these exercises is to educate both the C-suite and technical responders about what can happen, and for them to practice their responses to various security scenarios while identifying areas for improvement.

&quot;As much as it is about establishing muscle memory and ensuring that you have a good process and can execute against that process, it&#39;s also just as much about education,&quot; Mark Lance, GuidePoint security VP of digital forensics and incident response and threat intel, told The Register. &quot;So for instance, a senior leadership team learning about ransomware typically walks away from it saying, &#39;I know more about this and the potential risks and threats associated with it.&#39;&quot;

One way organizations can account for the influx of AI-related threats is to use AI to develop scenarios, said Bill Reid, a security advisor to healthcare and life sciences organizations in Google Cloud&#39;s Office of the CISO. &quot;Want to test AI fakes? Make one and use it in the tabletop exercise,&quot; he told The Register.

In addition to using AI to develop the exercises, companies should also use it to &quot;measure and facilitate exercises and outcomes,&quot; said Taylor Lehman, director of Google Cloud Office of the CISO&#39;s healthcare and life sciences division.

&quot;Expose information about your environment - like threats, controls, vulnerabilities, assets of all types, key risks, stakeholders, customer personas, etc. - to AI systems who can then help craft very meaningful and very specific, realistic scenarios that will help you hone the scenario and deliver specific types of outcomes you want as part of an exercise,&quot; Lehman told The Register.

Other new-ish AI threats include deepfakes, and this especially affects Google Cloud&#39;s financial services clients, Alvarez said. Because of this, many organizations in the financial sector have - or should - add deepfakes, both audio and video, to their scenarios.

&quot;However, the use of AI-generated attacks is not only deepfakes,&quot; Mandiant Consulting director David Wong said. &quot;AI is also used in each stage of the attack lifecycle and increases the volume and speed of the attacks. Designers of tabletop exercises must adapt to the speed and volume in their scenarios.&quot;

When a deepfake CEO demands a money transfer, the drill shouldn&#39;t be about detection software, but strictly testing a mandatory out-of-band verification via a standard phone call

Alvarez also suggests reaching out to a local FBI Field Office and asking the Cyber Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) if they can provide an agent to participate. &quot;This is a good way to establish a point-of-contact at the field office for future reference and communication,&quot; he said, adding that for full-scale exercises including C-suite, board members, and other internal stakeholders, consider reaching out to CISA to participate, too.

CISA, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also provides several free resources designed to help companies conduct their own exercises covering a range of threat scenarios.

One Google Cloud Office of the CISO senior consultant, Anton Chuvakin, advocated for analog - and caution - when it comes to &quot;fighting AI with more AI. Instead, focus your tabletop exercises on introducing analog friction to break the adversary&#39;s speed,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;When a deepfake CEO demands a money transfer, the drill shouldn&#39;t be about detection software, but strictly testing a mandatory out-of-band verification via a standard phone call.&quot;

Plus, don&#39;t rely only on online files, he added. &quot;Exercises must practice reverting to minimum viable business operations, utilizing offline golden copies of data and robust approval processes that an algorithm cannot spoof,&quot; Chuvakin said. &quot;If you can&#39;t trust what you see on the screen, your strongest defense is actually process, not technology.&quot;

All the experts The Reg talked with recommended at least one or two tabletops per year, and tailoring these exercises to specific audiences, separating C-suite leaders and technical responders, for example.

&quot;From my prior FBI experience, the vast majority of companies have never done a tabletop exercise,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;A good starting point or goal should be at least twice a year with the second tabletop exercise incorporating the lessons learned from the first.&quot;

Participation should vary based on the scenario, according to Ganacharya, with the C-suite participating &quot;at least semiannually because AI-powered attacks demand executive level decisions.&quot;

Technical drills, such as trialing new ransomware procedures, may only require the Security Operations Center (SOC) and incident response teams, while high-impact scenarios like insider leaks and reputational risk should also include legal, PR, HR and senior leadership.

Other operational leaders may require more frequent exercises with targeted scenarios, Ganacharya said. This includes deputies, directors, and SOC leaders - the people that executives rely on to carry out day-to-day operations.

And, as always, remember Murphy&#39;s Law. As Ganacharya put it: &quot;Every exercise should include alternates, because real incidents rarely happen when your first choice responder is available.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview According to Remedio CEO Tal Kollender, the only way to beat the bad guys hacking into corporate networks is to &quot;think like a hacker,&quot; and because not everyone is a teenage hacker turned cybersecurity startup chief executive, she built an AI to do this.

&quot;My thought was: if I have a hacker mindset, why not adapt it into defense,&quot; Kollender told The Register. &quot;Because if you don&#39;t think like a hacker, you won&#39;t be able to beat them, right?&quot;

We sat down (virtually) with Kollender to discuss her former life hacking video games and how that led her to start Remedio (formerly Gytpol). The startup recently raised $65 million in its first-ever funding round on a $300 million valuation, and its clients include household names Colgate-Palmolive and Kraft Heinz.

&quot;Curiosity is the name of the game,&quot; she said. &quot;I was always curious. What brought me to what I do now is solving some problems from a different angle.&quot;

For example: one plus one equals two. &quot;But in order to get to two, you don&#39;t really need one plus one,&quot; Kollender said. &quot;There are other ways - two plus zero minus two plus four. There are various options to get to the results.&quot;

Her first lesson in this came from an Israeli online game that Kollender describes as a cross between Tetris and Icy Tower. She had been ranked No. 1, and then overnight, an unknown player beat her. &quot;I was pretty jealous and upset, and at the same time I said, &#39;there&#39;s no way someone can beat me because I&#39;m the best.&#39;&quot;

The other player&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; score led her to figure out how to hack into the game&#39;s database and write her own impossible score, before moving on to hacking Sony PlayStation games, chat apps, and phones.

Later, while serving in the Israeli Air Force and training to become a fighter pilot, the Israel Defense Forces reassigned her to the IT Corp Cyber Security-Systems Division.

On the defender side and in the private sector, Kollender previously worked as a system security architect at Dell EMC before starting her own company with co-founders Gilad Raz and Yakov Kogan in 2019.

&quot;We wanted to change the way companies fix things, without any business disruption,&quot; she said. To this end, Remedio uses AI to find and auto-remediate vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, weak controls, compliance gaps, and other security threats across corporate devices.

As criminals increasingly use AI to do these same things - scan for vulnerabilities, missing patches, and misconfigurations - it becomes a battle of AI versus AI, and a race between defenders and attackers.

Digital intruders used to break into networks and spend months snooping around, searching for credentials to allow lateral movement and steal valuable data. &quot;Now, they do it in weeks or days. That&#39;s how fast AI has made things,&quot; Kollender said. &quot;And if defenders don&#39;t keep up the pace and grow&quot; their own usage of the technology, &quot;then the attackers might beat us.&quot;

As several former teenage hackers found out in their formative years, Kollender refuses to get beat at her own game, whether that&#39;s a video game or cyber defense. ®

            <div id="article-text">Wi-Fi 8 will be a step change in connectivity, if Intel can be believed, and will be able to adapt intelligently to local conditions to deliver a reliable service without the slowdowns users often experience when the network is congested.

The next-gen release of Wi-Fi is not expected to be available in devices for a couple of years, but the industry seems determined that it will fix the issues that meant previous releases did not always live up to user expectations.

&quot;The focus of Wi-Fi has always been on: how can we make it faster? You&#39;ll see that with Wi-Fi 8, that&#39;s going to change a little bit,&quot; said Intel Fellow and wireless chief technology officer Carlos Cordeiro.

This means that the upcoming standard will not increase the peak theoretical data rate and will not introduce wider channels, or higher order modulations compared with Wi-Fi 7. Instead, the new capabilities will be subtler.

&quot;What you&#39;re going to see is that we can get better rate at a given range. What I mean by that is, if you take an access point (AP) and a Wi-Fi 7 device, and you get a given data rate, then you replace that with a Wi-Fi 8 device, you&#39;ll be able to get a higher data rate at that same location, at that same range.&quot;

Cordeiro says that Intel sees Wi-Fi 8 as the &quot;connective technology for the AI era,&quot; one where in the not-too-distant future, everyone will have massive amounts of compute and storage available to them over the network, and this means that you can&#39;t allow the wireless connection to become the bottleneck to accessing all those resources.

&quot;So you really need high performance, which you know, Wi-Fi largely already is. But we need to make it more reliable. We need to make it more low latency. We need to make it, you know, more intelligent,&quot; he explained.

This means making devices and the network kit more context-aware, able to predict user needs, and adapt to them.

Cordeiro highlighted use cases that illustrate the challenges Wi-Fi 8 is aiming to address for users.

The first one is operating on a campus network, such as a university or corporate office site. Here, roaming and co-existence are key capabilities, but it currently can take tens of milliseconds for roaming from one AP to another to happen.

&quot;So we took a very conscious effort in Wi-Fi 8 to define something we call seamless roaming, where we&#39;re going to push down to the Wi-Fi technology a lot of the key negotiations and preparation for roaming, so that we can get it into single-digit low milliseconds, and do that with zero packet loss, right? So that if you&#39;re doing Wi-Fi calling, you can move from one AP to the other, and you won&#39;t notice the switch.&quot;

In a home environment, you might have someone on a conference call, someone else playing a game and another person watching a Netflix video. In situations like this, where there is a mix of traffic, you have to be able to prioritize, Cordeiro says, and so Wi-Fi 8 will have much better capabilities around quality of service, to be able to indicate low latency traffic and allow the network to prioritize it.

&quot;How can we deal with the fact that some devices are very high-end, some devices are very low-end, but they are in the same network, and you want to make sure that those low-end devices don&#39;t clog the channel, that everybody can get access and make better use of the spectrum,&quot; he explained.

This is also an area of focus in crowded office environments, where interference management and longer device battery life are desirable.

Another technology being developed with Wi-Fi 8 is the ability to sense the environment using the radio waves emitted by the devices.

&quot;We expect to see Wi-Fi devices able to detect the distance to other devices that are nearby, not only the distance, but what is the direction to those devices, with the ability to become a sensor to detect distance, to detect the presence of people, to detect gestures,&quot; Cordeiro claimed.

&quot;Essentially what we are doing is that we&#39;re going to be able to make devices be context aware, aware of their surroundings, and that&#39;s going to enable and open up the ability for new applications to be developed,&quot; he added.

One such scenario Cordeiro suggests is one where a user is in an online meeting on their laptop, and gets up and walks away holding their phone.

&quot;Automatically, the laptop and the phone will realize that they are moving away from each other, and this Teams session could transfer to my phone. I don&#39;t have to do anything automatically. I move away, the Teams session goes to my phone, and then when I come back to my PC, the Teams session automatically transfers back to the PC,&quot; he explained.

Others include waking up your PC when you approach it, or having it automatically lock itself if you walk away, or even detecting and acting on gestures, such as swiping to move to the next slide in a presentation.

In an Intel White Paper on Wi-Fi 8, the company lists some of the enhancements that aim to deliver these capabilities. Link reliability and performance will be improved through smarter use of modulation and coding schemes (MCS), for example.

Currently, if a device supports multiple spatial streams (MIMO), all streams use the same coding scheme. Wi-Fi 8 changes this so each stream can use the best possible encoding for its conditions, meaning that if one stream has a weaker signal, it can send data in a more robust way while other streams use an MCS optimized for speed.

Wi-Fi 8 adds more intermediate modulation steps, which means that medium signal strength users should see a better data rate than with Wi-Fi 7, who may have to choose a less optimal modulation.

It also promises better error correction via low-density parity check (LDPC) codewords that are double the length of those in Wi-Fi 7, meaning fewer retransmissions and a connection that can extend further.

Multiple access points will also be able to work together to optimize transmissions, making sure they do not transmit at the same time on the same channel, for example. With an enterprise network, two APs might take turns millisecond by millisecond, which avoids collisions, and devices therefore waste less time waiting and retrying.

Giving better access for critical applications will come via an enhanced version of EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) called Prioritized EDCA. Under this, if a device marks traffic as high priority (like video), the network will let those packets through first even in crowded conditions, Intel says.

Security is also being stepped up in Wi-Fi 8 with encryption for control frames, which prevents spoofing attacks such as fake disconnect messages. Support for IEEE P802.11bi will extend protection to the association process and other management frames that were previously exposed, providing stronger encryption for Wi-Fi handshakes and improving privacy.

As previously noted, Wi-Fi 8 will build on the basic specifications of Wi-Fi 7, which is still being gradually adopted in new devices and access points / wireless routers. This means that it will be capable of operating in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands of the wireless spectrum, and uses 320 MHz channel bandwidth, double that of previous releases.

According to Intel, it will be backwards compatible, in the sense that Wi-Fi 5/6/7 devices will work with Wi-Fi 8 APs (and vice versa), just without the benefits of the new capabilities.

Chipmaker Broadcom recently announced a portfolio of Wi-Fi 8 silicon, but Cordeiro said Intel was holding off until the availability of certification, because certification guarantees a minimal level of interoperability.

&quot;We want to avoid any problems in the market. We want to make sure that clients and access points from various vendors work seamlessly, and so in our case, we do expect to have solutions once certifications are in place,&quot; he said.

Intel&#39;s pitch for Wi-Fi 8 is that it will &quot;just feel better,&quot; taking the raw speed of Wi-Fi 7 and adding intelligence to deliver that speed consistently, keeping latency-sensitive apps running without hiccups. The proof of the pudding, of course, will be in the eating. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion When Microsoft recently decided to open source the seminal text adventure game Zork, I contemplated revisiting it during the festive season... until I realized I&#39;ve spent much of 2025 experiencing the worst of such games when using AI chatbots.

Adventure games like Zork and its many imitators invited players to explore a virtual world, often a Tolkien-esque cave, that existed only as words.

&quot;You enter a dark room. A Goblin pulls a rusty knife from its belt and prepares to attack!&quot; was a typical moment in such games. Players, usually armed with imagined medieval weapons, might respond &quot;Hit Goblin&quot; in the expectation that phrase would see them draw a sword to smite the monster.

But the game might respond to &quot;Hit Goblin&quot; by informing players &quot;You punch the Goblin.&quot;

The Goblin would dodge the punch and stab the player with the rusty knife.

Game over... until the player tried &quot;Hit Goblin with sword&quot; or &quot;Stab Goblin&quot; or whatever other syntax the game required, assuming they didn&#39;t just give up out of frustration at having to guess the correct verb/noun combination.

Adventure games were big in the 1980s, a time when computers were flaky and unpredictable, and AI was an imagined technology. Games that required obscure syntax were mostly tolerable and generally excused.

I&#39;m less tolerant of AI making me learn its language.

For example, I recently prompted Microsoft&#39;s Copilot chatbot to scour data available online and convert some elements of it into a downloadable spreadsheet. The bot accepted that request and produced a Python script that it claimed will write a spreadsheet.

In other AI experiments, I have found that the same prompt produces different results on different days. One prompt I use to check I haven&#39;t left any terrible typos in stories produces responses in a different format every time I use it. Microsoft has also, in its wisdom, decided to offer different versions of Copilot in Office and in its desktop app. Each produces different results from the same prompt and the same source material.

Using AI has therefore become a non-stop experiment in &quot;Hit/Kill/Stab/Smite Goblin.&quot;

And when Copilot starts using a new model, which it does without any change to its UI, prompts that worked reliably in the past produce different results, meaning I need to relearn what works.

My point here is not that chatbots do dumb things and make mistakes. It&#39;s that working with this tech feels like groping through a cave in the dark – a horrible game I call &quot;PromptQuest&quot; – while being told this is improving my productivity.

After Copilot gave me a Python script instead of a spreadsheet, I played a long session of PromptQuest during which Microsoft&#39;s AI responded to many different prompts by repeatedly telling me it was ready to make a spreadsheet, would make it available to download, and had completed the job to my satisfaction.

It never delivered the spreadsheet, and my frustration grew to the point at which I instructed Copilot to produce a progress bar so I could see it work.

A progress bar produced by Microsoft Copilot

You can see the results above. Ironically, I think it looks a lot like the output of a text adventure game. ®

            <div id="article-text">On Call Y2K December 26th is a holiday across much of the Reg-reading world, but it&#39;s also a Friday – the day on which we present a fresh instalment of On Call, the reader-contributed column that recounts your tales of tech support encounters and exasperation.

This holiday season we&#39;re dipping into tales of tech support in the time of Y2K, starting with this tale from a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Cane&quot; and who told us that in December 1999 he worked in the IT department at the UK branch of a &quot;multinational booze purveyor.&quot;

Cane said he and his team felt confident.

&quot;We spent much of the last two years testing and verifying everything, upgrading and replacing as needed,&quot; he told On Call.

Senior management came to appreciate the importance of the task and to make sure all staff understood the seriousness of the Y2K remediation effort, commissioned a custom screensaver that displayed a countdown to the fateful moment.

The alcohol making organization prevented the IT team from taking leave for two weeks after December 31st and warned they may need to be on-site full time for the duration in case things went wrong.

&quot;They also hired consultants at ruinous cost to sit there and wear suits,&quot; Cane told On Call. &quot;As the hour ticked closer, we were ordered by the Top Floor People to physically disconnect the network cable from the internet, to prevent little viruses from crawling down the wires and getting us.&quot;

All present watched the clock tick down from 1999 to 2000, then breathed a sigh of relief when nothing happened.

&quot;After an hour we were allowed to reconnect to the outside world and confirm that the world had not ended,&quot; Cane told On Call.

&quot;Any PC that had been left switched on – against instructions – mysteriously crashed,&quot; Cane wrote.

In case your career started after the year 2000 or you&#39;ve forgotten the Y2K mess, let&#39;s refresh your memory … by explaining that in the early years of computing, memory was so scarce and expensive that programmers used only two digits to record years.

That became an issue as the year 2000 approached, because as the clock ticked over into the new year some programs would assume it was the year 1900 and malfunction … perhaps catastrophically.

All around the world, organizations spent billions testing and remediating their code. And on New Year&#39;s Eve 1999, many IT pros worked instead of partying, to make sure skilled help was at hand in case things went bad.

The IT team swung into action and rebooted the nearest machine, which came back to life and displayed a screensaver that was now counting backwards into negative numbers.

Cane later learned that the developer of the Y2K screensaver did not test it for the Y2K bug.

&quot;It was created, at high cost, by an external and apparently incompetent third party,&quot; he told On Call.

Cane&#39;s company kept the tech team camping in the office for a couple of days, until it became clear nothing else would break.

&quot;We returned to normal, though the consultants were maybe a bit more flush in the bank account,&quot; Cane reported. &quot;Us poor salaried employees had to make do with time-off-in-lieu.&quot;

Because you can’t be trusted to remember which group chat someone dumped a happy hour invite in.

There are plenty of dating apps out there and apps that turn your chaos of work obligations into easily actionable lists. There is also a growing number of apps that help you make new friends. The pitch for Rodeo is a bit different in that it uses AI to help you schedule activities with your existing friends.

The company was started by a pair of former Hinge execs who felt it was more difficult than it should be to make plans with friends. Parenting, work, 37 different group chats — all of this can lead to things like maintaining your relationships falling by the wayside.

Rodeo can take social media posts for events or restaurants, or even just screenshots of group chats, and streamline the act of turning them into actual plans with friends. For instance, if you upload a screenshot of an Instagram ad for a movie, it will pull in theaters where it’s playing and showtimes and let you buy tickets. There is also a shortcut to send an invite to a friend you want to “wrangle” into your plans.

Activities can also be sorted into lists for things you might want to save for later, like good date night restaurants, or things to do with your old college buddies, like a local paintball spot. Those lists can be collaborative too, so you can invite all your former frat bros to a specific list to make suggestions.

Somewhat surprisingly, the founders Sam Levy and Tim MacGougan aren’t loudly advertising the AI component of their app. While LLMs and other AI-adjacent tech are all the rage in Silicon Valley, it seems these two got the memo that Americans want AI to stay out of their personal lives. However, it is the AI element that sets Rodeo apart. Sharing collaborative lists, bookmarking restaurants to go to, and sending calendar invites for events to friends is something anyone can do with just a Gmail account. Rodeo is saving you the hassle of manually pulling in all the details for events or venues and turning them into invites and actions.

The company isn’t completely avoiding buzzwords. According to Business Insider, Levy describes the app as “a ‘second brain’ for planning activities with friends and family.” So Rodeo is clearly hoping that the obsession with organization that has driven the success of tools like Notion, Obsidian, and My Mind will work for its fledgling social app.

Rodeo is available as an invite-only beta right now, but you can download the iOS app to get on the waiting list.

The modular PC maker will now charge $10 per GB for its 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB DDR5 RAM modules.

The modular PC company Framework is adjusting the price of its DDR5 RAM modules once again as the cost of memory continues to surge. In an update on Wednesday, Framework said it will charge $10 per GB for 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB, with “slightly higher” prices for the 48GB and up.

Framework first announced a price hike on memory earlier this month, citing “substantially higher costs” from suppliers and distributors. With this most recent increase in place, the 8GB variation jumped from $60 to $80, the 16GB option increased from $120 to $160, and the 32GB variation went from $240 to $320. Meanwhile, the price tag of the 48GB option more than doubled from $240 as of June 2025 to $620. The 64GB (2 x 32GB) and 96GB (2 x 48GB) modules are also more expensive, priced at $640 and $1,240, respectively.

The price increase affects the configurable memory options that come with Framework’s DIY Edition laptop, as the company is still not selling standalone DDR5 RAM modules to preserve its inventory. To avoid higher prices on its DIY Edition laptop, Framework notes users can order the device without memory, allowing them to reuse an existing module or find a cheaper option using the link to PCPartPicker that Framework now provides directly on its website.

This likely won’t be the end of price hikes for Framework, as suppliers indicate that “prices will continue to increase going into early 2026,” according to the post. “We have absorbed and continue to absorb some of the price increases to be able to offer this new pricing, but it is very likely we’ll need to adjust module prices again within the next month,” Framework says. “We’ll only increase prices to cover increases in costs, and we’ll bring prices back down as costs come down in the future.”

The International Data Corporation expects the global memory shortage to “persist well into 2027” as memory makers like Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix shift their resources toward the lucrative AI industry.

Unlike the day after Thanksgiving, when people are rushing online and to the stores to look for deals, the day after Christmas is usually a time to recover from the festivities and check your budget to see how much all that gifting has cost you. However, if you’re in a shopping mood, or if you suddenly realized you forgot somebody important, there are still some deals out there.

For example, Nintendo is offering a bunch of its best-known games at deals ranging from 25 to 50 percent off. These include Princess Peach: Showtime ($41.99 down from $59.99), The Legend of Zelda, Echoes of Wisdom (also $41.99 down from $59.99), Super Mario Odyssey ($39.99 down from $59.99), and a slew of others. Non-Nintendo Switch games, like Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition ($39.99 down from $69.99) for Switch 2, are available as well.

Princess Peach: Showtime! is the first Nintendo game to star the Mushroom Kingdom royal in nearly 20 years, and it’s a welcome return to form. Peach finds herself having to fight, puzzle, and platform her way through different sets in a community theater. Read our review.

Echoes of Wisdom finally lets you play as Nintendo’s titular heroine. The game mixes the top-down perspective of 2D Zelda games with gameplay from the series’ newer, open-world 3D entries. Read our review.

The first mainline Mario title for the Nintendo Switch, Super Mario Odyssey, doesn’t disappoint. The game brings plenty of fun, new mechanics, and ample charm. Read our review.

CD Projekt Red has delivered on an incredibly ambitious vision: a vast virtual city with a complex narrative and roleplaying system. Read our review.

So if you’ve received a new Switch 2 for the holidays — or you gifted yourself one — this is a great way to start assembling your game library for the new year.

Amazon is still offering major discounts on some of its smart speakers. For example, the Amazon Echo Spot, a nifty bedside smart speaker / clock, is on sale at Amazon for $44.99 down from $79.99, the lowest price it has sold for. If you want something with a screen, the Echo Show 5 is available at Amazon for $59.99, down from $89.99, and while it’s gone down as low as $39.99 in the past, this isn’t a bad price if you want one now. Read our reviews of the Echo Spot and the Echo Show 5.

Anker’s Prime Charger is a charging station that supports 250W output via four USB-C and two USB-A ports. It’s now at its lowest price of $99.99 (down from $169.99, a savings of $70) at Amazon and at Anker (using the code WS7DV2I5IMSW).

You can still get an Apple Airtag for $19 (down from $29) at Walmart — and after all, how can you have too many of these handy trackers (our choice as best tracker for iPhone users), especially if you’ve gotten any holiday gifts that you really don’t want to misplace? Read our original review.

You’ll be able to swap back to your old email at any point.

If you’ve been saddled with some awful Gmail address you chose in high school (looking at you, LazySexyCool3030), help appears to be on the way. According to a Google account support page in Hindi the company is allowing some people to change their email address. According to the page (via Google Translate):

If your Google Account email address ends with gmail.com, you can replace it with one that ends with @gmail.com.

This appears to be more like adding a second address to your account than actually changing your email address, however. Email sent to your old address will still arrive in your inbox, and that address will still work to sign in to any accounts associated with it. In fact, your old address is set as an alias for the new one. Any messages, photos, and other files associated with the old address will also be preserved.

There are some limits on the ability to change addresses. You can only do it once a year, for one. And you can only create three new addresses in total — after that, you’re cut off. You can still revert to your old email at any time. There are also apparently some issues with settings and files carrying over on ChromeOS, so it’s advised that you make a full backup of your computer before switching.

For people who got their Gmail address when they were young, before they even considered the possibility that they might not be that into Naruto forever, this could save a lot of headaches. It’s also likely to be appreciated by anyone who has changed their name.

The updated support page isn’t showing up in English, and the option to change your Gmail address hasn’t appeared for any Verge staffers yet. According to 9to5Google the feature is “gradually rolling out to all users.” We’ve reached out to Google for confirmation.

Aside from free shipping, Prime Video is the second-best perk that comes with an Amazon Prime subscription. This year, the streaming service delivered several strong installments to some of its biggest series like Reacher, Fallout, and Invincible — but it also premiered some great new shows and spinoffs to keep things fresh.

Here’s a list of the best shows and new seasons released on Prime Video in 2025.

Reacher is one of my favorite series on Amazon Prime Video, and the latest installment doesn’t disappoint. After winding up in Maine, Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson) — the former military officer-turned-drifter — gets entangled in a DEA investigation, leading him to go undercover as the bodyguard for the son of Zachary Beck (Anthony Michael Hall), the owner of a rug import company involved in some shady business dealings.

Video game adaptations keep getting better, but even still, Fallout stands among the best. The first season introduced its trio of postapocalyptic heroes: vault dweller Lucy (Ella Purnell), conflicted Brotherhood of Steel knight Maximus (Aaron Moten), and a ghoul known as... the Ghoul (Walton Goggins). They’re still around in the new second season, but the show also expands its scope quite a bit, with a story that covers more of the world itself, while also diving deep into the past.

I wasn’t sure what to expect when I first switched on Hazbin Hotel, but after watching the first season, I was hooked. The second season is another strong entry into the musical series, with Charlie Morningstar (Erika Henningsen) and her dysfunctional group of friends working to revive the hotel after it was nearly destroyed by an attack from heaven. But things don’t stay peaceful for long, as the three Vs leading Hell’s entertainment industry plot to expand their control over the netherworld.

Bosch: Legacy debuted in 2022 as a follow-up to the original Bosch series, and it returned for its third and final season in March. During this final chapter, we see Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver) take on the role of private investigator, all while contending with controversy surrounding the murder of his daughter’s kidnapper, Kurt Dockweiler (David Denman). At the same time, Bosch delves into the disappearance of the Gallagher family as Honey “Money” Chandler launches a campaign to become Los Angeles District Attorney.

If you’re disappointed that Bosch: Legacy has come to a close, Prime Video debuted a spinoff series in July. The show, called Ballard, stars Maggie Q as Detective Renée Ballard, the head of the LAPD’s new — and underfunded — cold case division. As Ballard and her team dust off old homicide investigations, she dredges up evidence of deep-seated corruption within the police department.

The third season of Invincible marks a major shift for our titular superhero, Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun), who steps into a new suit and a new role as the Earth’s defender. Throughout the season, Grayson trains even harder as he prepares for battle with the powerful, superhuman warriors from the Viltrum Empire, while continuing to wrestle with and distance himself from the influence of his father, Omni Man (J.K. Simmons).

Daniel Dae Kim stars as David Jung, a former spy who comes out of hiding to find his daughter, Rebecca (Reina Hardesty), who is working as an assassin in South Korea for a now-corrupt intelligence agency called Caddis. With his wife and small child in tow, David aims to pull Rebecca from Caddis’s clutch — but his ties to the organization put a target on the back of him and his family.

We still have to wait a few more months to see the final season of The Boys, but in the meantime, you might want to check out its spinoff, Gen V, which released its second season in September. Picking up after season 4 of The Boys, the series follows Marie (Jaz Sinclair) and her friends as they navigate a transformed Godolkin University — now a militarized training ground for supes — amid a world where Homelander has more control than ever.

If you’re a fan of the original Gundam series, Prime Video’s Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX is a must-watch. It draws from the 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam show, taking place in an alternate universe where the militaristic Principality of Zeon is in control. The story follows Amate Yuzuriha (Thea Saccoliti/Tomoyo Kurosawa), a high-school student who becomes the pilot of the mobile suit prototype, GQuuuuuuX. Amate engages in a series of clan battles while fighting to protect her friend, a war refugee.

The Girlfriend is a six-episode series that’s easy to binge-watch. It stars Robin Wright as Laura, a wealthy mother who’s a bit too protective of her son and becomes overwhelmed with suspicion after meeting his charming new girlfriend, Cherry Laine (Olivia Cooke). As Laura becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering Cherry’s true intentions — whether real or imagined — her fixation begins to strain her relationship with her son and fractures the rest of her family.

The two-armed robot can complete a ‘wide range’ of tasks around the home, according to LG.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

LG is getting ready to take the wraps off a new robot it claims is capable of performing a “wide range” of household chores. The robot, called LG CLOiD, will make its debut at CES next month, featuring two articulated arms and five individually actuated fingers on each hand.

Though we only have a description and two images showing LG CLOiD’s five-fingered hands, it already seems a lot different from the two-wheeled home companion LG revealed last year, which came with a handle attached to its head rather than two arms.

LG says CLOiD’s motor-equipped arms operate with seven degrees of freedom, indicating a more humanlike range of motion and flexibility. Along with a chipset embedded inside LG CLOiD’s “head,” the robot comes with a display, speaker, camera, and sensors built for voice interaction, “expressive communication,” and navigation. It also features LG’s “Affectionate Intelligence” technology, which the company previously described as AI-powered tech designed to “better understand and empathize with customers.”

With CES just weeks away, we’ll only have to wait a little longer to find out what the rest of CLOiD looks like (and whether we’ll finally get a robot that can take out the trash for us).

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1129294/ronald-deibert-citizen-lab-digital-threats-spies-cybersecurity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <h2>Four bright spots in climate news in 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1130191/good-climate-news-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate news hasn’t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world’s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.

We’re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year.

One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world’s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.

That’s happened before, but only when the nation’s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China’s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise.

So what’s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it’s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.

Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That’s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year.

It’s too early to say China’s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030.

To be clear, China still isn’t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it’s now both producing most of the world’s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity—and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years.

It’s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it’s needed most.

Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.

Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology’s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year.

We’re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid.

The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.

But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI’s influence on energy: It’s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies.

In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they’re looking for alternatives.

Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant.

Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don’t. There’s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can’t hurt.

Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We’ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago.

The world is on track for about 2.6 °C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That’s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it’s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 °C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal.

That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development—and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.

The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 °C goal set out in the international agreement.

But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we’ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations yet of the first days of pregnancy and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called blastoids. The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

This means that in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
