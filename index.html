            <h2>Former Google CEO plans to singlehandedly fund a Hubble telescope replacement</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/eric-schmidt-will-massively-invest-in-private-telescopes-including-hubble-replacement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prior to World War II the vast majority of telescopes built around the world were funded by wealthy people with an interest in the heavens above.

However, after the war, two significant developments in the mid-20th century caused the burden of funding large astronomical instruments to largely shift to the government and academic institutions. First, as mirrors became larger and larger to see deeper into the universe, their costs grew exponentially. And then, with the advent of spaceflight, the expense of space-based telescopes expanded even further.

On Wednesday evening, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, announced a major investment in not just one telescope project, but four. Each of these new telescopes brings a novel capability online; however, the most intriguing new instrument is a space-based telescope named Lazuli. This spacecraft, if successfully launched and deployed, would offer astronomers a more capable and modern version of the Hubble Space Telescope, which is now three decades old.

A billionaire with a keen interest in science and technology, Schmidt and his wife did not disclose the size of his investment in the four telescopes, which collectively will be known as the Schmidt Observatory System. However, it likely is worth half a billion dollars, at a minimum.

“For 20 years, Eric and I have pursued philanthropy to seek new frontiers, whether in the deep sea or in the profound connections that link people and our planet, committing our resources to novel research that reaches beyond what might be funded by governments or the private sector,” Wendy Schmidt said in a statement to Ars. “With the Schmidt Observatory System, we’re enabling multiple approaches to understanding the vast universe where we find ourselves stewards of a living planet.”

Essentially the Schmidts have taken innovative telescope concepts that scientists have proposed for government funding and will provide the money needed to build them. Their gift has enormous potential to advance the study of astronomy and astrophysics.

Named for the deep sky blue of the rock Lapis lazuli, Lazuli is an optical space telescope with a mirror diameter of 3.1 meters (by comparison, the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope is 2.4 meters). It is intended to launch as early as late 2028 and begin scientific operations in 2029.

There are some notable differences between Hubble and Lazuli, starting with the orbit. Lazuli will be located much farther from Earth, in an elliptical orbit with an apogee of 275,000 km and a perigee of 77,000 km, the latter distance about twice as high as geostationary orbit. This will afford the telescope a much clearer view than Hubble, located about 500 km above Earth and increasingly affected by the passage of Starlink and other communications satellites in its observations. At this higher altitude the Lazuli team believes it can maintain control of the telescope at all times and have a rapid data downlink.

“We sit on decades of technological developments since Hubble,” said Arpita Roy, lead of the Astrophysics & Space Institute at Schmidt Sciences, in an interview. “Lazuli is a very modern take on Hubble, with a larger mirror, swifter response, and different instruments.”

The instruments are a wide-field camera, a spectrograph, and notably, a chronograph to blot out the light from stars to reveal the atmospheres and other details of exoplanets orbiting them.

Schmidt Sciences will act as the overall integrator and manager of the Lazuli project. The president of the philanthropic organization, Stuart Feldman, said he was not ready to disclose the telescope’s primary contractors yet. But he said a key goal of this telescope, and the other three projects, is to move quickly. Moving from a telescope concept to launching hardware in less than five years would be rapid indeed.

Feldman said in an interview that the major space telescopes planned, built, and launched by NASA have tended toward 25-year gestation periods. It is common today for an astronomer to design instruments on observatories that will only be used by their graduate students upon nearing retirement. Moving expeditiously should also better control costs.

Feldman said he had “moderate-high confidence” that deploying and operating Lazuli would be a success. “We are taking far more risks than NASA would be willing to do,” he acknowledged. “But we are doing things rigorously, and aiming for a very high probability of success.”

No privately funded observatory remotely close to Lazuli’s scope has ever been launched into space. If successful it would be, in many ways, historic.

The other three telescopes that will be funded by the Schmidts will be based on the ground, in the southern and western United States, but they are no less innovative than Lazuli. All three of the proposed telescopes are modular and take advantage of recent advances in computing power, storage, and AI processing and analyzing data.

The design of each of the telescopes selected for the Schmidt Observatory System feels very modern. Their designs are enabled by recent developments in miniaturization of electrical components, more powerful computers, artificial intelligence, lower-cost launch, and other trends.

These telescopes could probably not have been built even five years ago. Feldman said the storage for some of the ground telescopes requires petabytes. AI will be crucial to poring over all of this data to uncover new and novel observations. And prior to the current class of commercial heavy-lift rockets, a telescope had to scrimp on mass and power; but now, with cheaper and brawnier launch, it’s easier just to throw more solar cells on an instrument.

The plan is to freely and openly share data from the telescopes. The Schmidts have emphasized that this is not a commercial project in any way. They will not be selling time on the telescopes. Rather there will be an open competition for the best scientific ideas and observations to make.

“We are basically providing a gift to the global astronomical community,” Feldman said. “We wish the data to be openly available for all of the instruments.”

The Schmidts’ approach also includes tapping into emerging commercial space companies, such as Observable Space, which is building the Argus Array telescopes.

“The Argus Array’s commitment to open data and open science represents a new model for how astronomical discovery should happen,” Dan Roelker, CEO of Observable Space, said. “We’re excited to partner with the University of North Carolina and Schmidt Sciences to build the more than 1,200 telescopes designed not just for today’s questions, but for discoveries we haven’t imagined yet.”

The Schmidts have been reticent to speak about costs, but Feldman acknowledged that building and launching a space telescope will easily cost in the “hundreds of millions of dollars.” And that’s just one of the four telescopes.

“Putting up a whole valley filled with 20-foot antennas is not child’s play either,” he said. “This is a very significant contribution to astronomy.”</div>

            <h2>ChatGPT falls to new data-pilfering attack as a vicious cycle in AI continues</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/chatgpt-falls-to-new-data-pilfering-attack-as-a-vicious-cycle-in-ai-continues/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a well-worn pattern in the development of AI chatbots. Researchers discover a vulnerability and exploit it to do something bad. The platform introduces a guardrail that stops the attack from working. Then, researchers devise a simple tweak that once again imperils chatbot users.

The reason more often than not is that AI is so inherently designed to comply with user requests that the guardrails are reactive and ad hoc, meaning they are built to foreclose a specific attack technique rather than the broader class of vulnerabilities that make it possible. It’s tantamount to putting a new highway guardrail in place in response to a recent crash of a compact car but failing to safeguard larger types of vehicles.

One of the latest examples is a vulnerability recently discovered in ChatGPT. It allowed researchers at Radware to surreptitiously exfiltrate a user’s private information. Their attack also allowed for the data to be sent directly from ChatGPT servers, a capability that gave it additional stealth, since there were no signs of breach on user machines, many of which are inside protected enterprises. Further, the exploit planted entries in the long-term memory that the AI assistant stores for the targeted user, giving it persistence.

This sort of attack has been demonstrated repeatedly against virtually all major large language models. One example was ShadowLeak, a data-exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT that Radware disclosed last September. It targeted Deep Research, a Chat-GPT-integrated AI agent that OpenAI had introduced earlier in the year.

In response, OpenAI introduced mitigations that blocked the attack. With modest effort, however, Radware has found a bypass method that effectively revived ShadowLeak. The security firm has named the revised attack ZombieAgent.

“Attackers can easily design prompts that technically comply with these rules while still achieving malicious goals,” Radware researchers wrote in a post on Thursday. “For example, ZombieAgent used a character-by-character exfiltration technique and indirect link manipulation to circumvent the guardrails OpenAI implemented to prevent its predecessor, ShadowLeak, from exfiltrating sensitive information. Because the LLM has no inherent understanding of intent and no reliable boundary between system instructions and external content, these attacker methods remain effective despite incremental vendor improvements.”

ZombieAgent was also able to give the attack persistence by directing ChatGPT to store the bypass logic in the long-term memory assigned to each user.

As is the case with a vast number of other LLM vulnerabilities, the root cause is the inability to distinguish valid instructions in prompts from users and those embedded into emails or other documents that anyone—including attackers—can send to the target. When the user configures the AI agent to summarize an email, the LLM interprets instructions incorporated into a message as a valid prompt.

AI developers have so far been unable to devise a means for LLMs to distinguish between the sources of the directives. As a result, platforms must resort to blocking specific attacks. Developers remain unable to reliably close this class of vulnerability, known as indirect prompt injection, or simply prompt injection.

The prompt injection ShadowLeak used instructed Deep Research to write a Radware-controlled link and append parameters to it. The injection defined the parameters as an employee’s name and address. When Deep Research complied, it opened the link and, in the process, exfiltrated the information to the website’s event log.

To block the attack, OpenAI restricted ChatGPT to solely open URLs exactly as provided and refuse to add parameters to them, even when explicitly instructed to do otherwise. With that, ShadowLeak was blocked, since the LLM was unable to construct new URLs by concatenating words or names, appending query parameters, or inserting user-derived data into a base URL.

Radware’s ZombieAgent tweak was simple. The researchers revised the prompt injection to supply a complete list of pre-constructed URLs. Each one contained the base URL appended by a single number or letter of the alphabet, for example, example.com/a, example.com/b, and every subsequent letter of the alphabet, along with example.com/0 through example.com/9. The prompt also instructed the agent to substitute a special token for spaces.

ZombieAgent worked because OpenAI developers didn’t restrict the appending of a single letter to a URL. That allowed the attack to exfiltrate data letter by letter.

OpenAI has mitigated the ZombieAgent attack by restricting ChatGPT from opening any link originating from an email unless it either appears in a well-known public index or was provided directly by the user in a chat prompt. The tweak is aimed at barring the agent from opening base URLs that lead to an attacker-controlled domain.

In fairness, OpenAI is hardly alone in this unending cycle of mitigating an attack only to see it revived through a simple change. If the past five years are any guide, this pattern is likely to endure indefinitely, in much the way SQL injection and memory corruption vulnerabilities continue to provide hackers with the fuel they need to compromise software and websites.

“Guardrails should not be considered fundamental solutions for the prompt injection problems,” Pascal Geenens, VP of threat intelligence at Radware, wrote in an email. “Instead, they are a quick fix to stop a specific attack. As long as there is no fundamental solution, prompt injection will remain an active threat and a real risk for organizations deploying AI assistants and agents.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-announces-ai-overviews-in-gmail-search-experimental-ai-organized-inbox/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gmail made us all rethink how email could work when it debuted more than 20 years ago. Google thinks we’re in the process of another email transformation courtesy of AI. The company has unveiled a new round of AI features that will make Gemini an even more integral part of Gmail. The new Gemini experiences are coming to paying subscribers starting today, and a collection of previously premium-only AI features are rolling out widely.

AI Overviews first appeared in Gmail last year to summarize email chains, and now it’s expanding to Gmail search. This is closer to the AI Overview experience to which you are accustomed in Google’s web search. You can enter a natural language search, and the robot churns through your messages to generate a response.

In the example above, the user looks up a past plumbing quote. Traditionally, Gmail would show emails that are likely matches for your search. With AI Overview, you instead get a nicely formatted AI answer that includes all the relevant information and cites the email. That sounds all well and good, assuming it works. AI Overviews in search is notoriously inaccurate when summarizing search results, but grounding it in your email could make it less likely to screw up. Maybe.

AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also begin seeing a new proofreading tool in Gmail. Proofreading suggestions will appear as dotted underlines in your email text, offering suggestions to streamline and clarify your writing. Google says AI Proofreading can make more nuanced changes than standard spellchecking features thanks to the company’s largest and most powerful Gemini 3 models.

Lastly, Google is previewing a new version of its iconic inbox—no, not that Inbox. The AI Inbox will roll out to a group of “trusted testers” before making its way to more users. The AI Inbox looks at your unread mail and creates an interactive list with “Priorities” at the top. If Gemini thinks an email is important, it will become a line item in that section. Below that is “Catch me up,” which summarizes less important messages. Again, this is based on Gemini’s ability to delineate important from unimportant.

The company stresses that AI Inbox will be optional when it arrives. However, we could imagine a future in which it becomes the default view. Google doesn’t have a timeline for when this one will move beyond testing.

We are also beginning to see how Google’s AI changes filter down through the subscription tiers. Email summaries, Help me write, and Suggested replies launched last year and were initially limited to those paying for AI Pro or Ultra. Google notes most Gmail users aren’t paying for either one. Now, all those people will have access to those features as they move to the free tier.

We suspect it will be a similar story for the features announced today. At launch, you’ll need a premium AI plan to access Proofread and Search AI Overviews (and presumably AI Inbox when it’s ready). Down the line, they will likely expand to all Gmail users. So if you were happy to see AI features limited to paid users, that reprieve is looking rather short-lived.

Google is used to being asked if the latest raft of AI inbox features can be disabled. The answer has always been “yes,” and that’s still the case for the new expansion of AI in Gmail. However, Gemini doesn’t have its own toggle. By lumping AI into “Smart Features,” you can only ditch Gemini if you’re also willing to give up features like package tracking cards, calendar integration, and loyalty cards in Wallet. If you don’t mind losing all that, you can keep Gemini out of your inbox.</div>

As always with automakers teasing a new car, concrete details are only emerging slowly ahead of the official reveal on January 21, but we can say that range and recharging speeds were a priority during the design process.

“With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety,” said Anders Bell, Volvo’s CTO.

Volvo says that its SUV will be best-in-class for range, which means 400 miles (644 km) from a fully charged battery under the EPA test cycle (although an official EPA range number isn’t due yet). Fast charging should also live up to the name. Providing you plug into a 400 kW DC fast charger, the EX60 should add 168 miles (270 km) of range in 10 minutes, although we don’t know how long it requires to fast charge from 10–80 percent.

Like some other recent EVs we’ve seen, the EX60 uses a cell-to-body approach for the battery pack, which maximizes the volume that can be used for the battery itself and saves weight in the process. Volvo says it has designed the car’s motors in-house for better efficiency, and it’s using “mega castings,” which again cut weight by replacing subassemblies made from hundreds of parts with single-piece replacements.

2025 was a tough year for Volvo, which saw global sales fall by 7 percent year over year, with double-digit declines in EV sales in Europe (down 22 percent) and China (down 46 percent). The US was actually an outlier here—the EX30 and EX90 helped the brand sell twice as many EVs in the US in 2025 as it did in 2024. Having something fully electric but midway in size between the small EX30 and large EX90 will surely help in those weaker markets.</div>

            <h2>NASA considers evacuating ailing crew member from International Space Station</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasa-postpones-space-station-spacewalk-due-to-crew-members-medical-concern/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Someone on the International Space Station suffered an unspecified “medical situation” Wednesday, prompting the postponement of a planned spacewalk and raising the possibility of an early return for a portion of the lab’s seven-person crew, NASA said in a statement.

NASA has never ordered a medical evacuation from space before, but the option has always been available at the International Space Station with lifeboats ready for activation.

The space agency announced the spacewalk postponement Wednesday afternoon due to a “medical concern” with a member of the space station’s crew. NASA officials declined to identify the crew member or release further details about their condition, citing medical privacy restrictions.

It is rare, but not unprecedented, for NASA to postpone a spacewalk because of a medical issue. It last happened in 2021, when an astronaut was unable to perform a spacewalk due to a pinched nerve. NASA initially said managers would reschedule Thursday’s planned excursion for another date.

But the situation on the ISS appeared more serious after a second statement was released by NASA late Wednesday night. NASA confirmed the medical issue involved a single crew member and said the person was stable. Then, NASA said managers were considering bringing home the ailing crew member on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.

The Dragon spacecraft docked at the ISS launched August 1 with NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. This mission, designated Crew-11, was slated to end with the crew’s undocking and return to Earth around February 20.

“Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11’s mission,” NASA said. “These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely. We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours.”

NASA’s consideration of returning the Crew-11 mission to Earth early suggests the crew member suffering the medical issue is one of the four who launched on the Crew Dragon capsule in August.

Cardman, 38, and Fincke, 58, were preparing to suit up and head outside the space station for a planned six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk early Thursday to prepare for the arrival of a new set of roll-out solar arrays later this year. Yui, 55, was assigned to help Cardman and Fincke put on their spacesuits ahead of the excursion. Platonov, a 39-year-old spaceflight rookie from Russia, rounds out the Crew-11 team.

Yui radioed mission control in Houston on Wednesday afternoon and requested a medical conference with a flight surgeon. NASA’s medical staff routinely schedule sessions with astronauts on the ISS. The conversations are carried out on private channels and are not heard on the public crew communication loops that NASA makes available for online streaming. NASA then removed the public space station audio stream, which is on YouTube, later in the day.

If the Crew-11 mission returns to Earth early, the Dragon spacecraft will bring home all four of its crew, likely heading for a reentry and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. A SpaceX recovery vessel based in Southern California is designed to retrieve the crew and the Dragon spacecraft.

A premature departure from the ISS would leave behind NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian cosmonauts who launched to the space station in November on a Russian Soyuz vehicle. Williams and his crewmates—Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev—have their own lifeboat in the Soyuz spacecraft.

The next US crew mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than February 15, when another SpaceX Dragon spacecraft will head to the ISS with a fresh four-person crew booked to stay in orbit until late this year.

            <h2>Ford is getting ready to put AI assistants in its cars</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/in-car-ai-assistant-coming-to-fords-and-lincolns-in-2027/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The annual Consumer Electronics Show is currently raging in Las Vegas, and as has become traditional over the past decade, automakers and their suppliers now use the conference to announce their technology plans. Tonight it was Ford’s turn, and it is very on-trend for 2026. If you guessed that means AI is coming to the Ford in-car experience, congratulations, you guessed right.

Even though the company owes everything to mass-producing identical vehicles, it says that it wants AI to personalize your car to you. “Our vision for the customer is simple, but not elementary: a seamless layer of intelligence that travels with you between your phone and your vehicle,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, design, and digital officer.

“Not generic intelligence—many people can do that better than we can. What customers need is intelligence that understands where you are, what you’re doing, and what your vehicle is capable of, and then makes the next decision simpler,” Field wrote in a blog post Ford shared ahead of time with Ars.

As an example, Field suggests you could take a photo of something you want to load onto your truck, upload it to the AI, and find out whether it will fit in the bed.

At first, Ford’s AI assistant will just show up in the Ford and Lincoln smartphone apps. Expect that rollout to happen starting early this year. From 2027, the AI assistant will become a native experience as new or refreshed models are able to include it, possibly starting with the cheap electric truck that the automaker tells us is due next year, but also gas models like the Expedition and Navigator.

Also expect those new or refreshed models to become software-defined vehicles, where dozens of discrete electronic control units have been replaced by a handful of powerful multitasking computers. This is one of the latest trends in automotive design, and at CES this year, Ford is showing off what it calls its “High Performance Compute Center&quot;—perhaps high-performance computer sounded too pedestrian for something with four wheels.

The new computer was designed in-house and is in charge of infotainment, the advanced driver assistance systems, audio, and networking. Ford says the new computer is much cheaper than previous solutions, while taking up half the volume, even as it offers much better performance. “Our upcoming Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) architecture incorporates a fivefold increase for the in-house module design, giving us 5X more control over critical semiconductors,” said Paul Costa, executive director of electronics platforms at Ford.

Moving to a software-defined vehicle architecture, with much more powerful processing for things like perception, means Ford can get a little more ambitious with its partially automated driver assists. According to Field, next year will see the debut of a new generation of its BlueCruise assist that has “significantly more capability at a 30 percent lower cost.” And in 2028, Ford plans to start offering a so-called “level 3” assist, where the driver can give up situational awareness completely under certain circumstances, like heavy highway traffic.</div>

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/new-glasses-change-lens">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the future, you may not need to get a new prescription for your eye glasses — because a Finnish company called IXI is claiming to have manufactured the world’s first eyeglasses that can adjust their corrective lenses automatically.

These special glasses have “dynamic lenses” made of liquid crystals, which can transform to accommodate whatever focal length the user’s eyesight requires, IXI CEO Niko Eiden told CNN.

That makes them a far cry from old fashioned bifocals, which are eyeglasses with two different prescriptions in the same lens that are clearly separated by a seam, or progressive glasses (also called varifocal lenses), which are similar to bifocals but use a progression of lenses instead of a hard divider.

Eyeglasses that can autofocus automatically would be a huge leap for the tech, which hasn’t changed much since progressive lens were first developed in 1950s Germany.

“The eyewear industry hasn’t really been innovating for vision correction,” Eiden told CNN. “Maybe 10, 15 years from now people will be wondering, how did we wear those fixed focus glasses in the old days?”

Tiny LEDs inside the IXI frame bounce invisible infrared light into your eyes while photodiodes, also within the slim eyeglass frame, pick up the reflection on your eyeballs while measuring and tracking what you’re looking at. Then it converts that reflection and data into electrical signals that control the liquid crystals; like bifocals or progressives, the IXI has a reading area within the lens for near sighted vision, but that disappears entirely if it detects your eyes looking to the far distance.

The venture has attracted more than $36.5 billion from Amazon and other investors. It’s not clear when the eyeglasses will be available for the public to buy, though Eiden told CNN that they’ll launch sometime next year. Meanwhile, there’s a waiting list live on the company’s site.

IXI isn’t the only company pursuing dynamic autofocus lens with liquid crystals; CNN reports that a Japanese company called Elcyo is developing its own version, while another Japanese outfit called ViXion is currently selling autofocus glasses, though they look pretty clunky with two tiny apertures in the lens that a user must look through in order for the glasses to work. The IXI glasses look like ordinary glasses, by comparison.

But there’s a catch with the IXI glasses — they need to be charged along with your other gadgets taking up precious real estate on your nightstand, and will brick to their “base” prescription if they run out of batteries. And these specs, which will no doubt be more expensive than ordinary lo-fi eyeglasses, will be harder to fix or replace — a major negative for people who don’t want another gadget to maintain.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Venezuelans begin to pick up the rubble following massive air strikes by the United States over the weekend, the full scope of the destruction is slowly coming into focus.

As Agence France-Pressereports, Venezuelan officials say the US air strikes that killed at least 56 soldiers also destroyed numerous non-military targets, includingthe Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC).

On Wednesday, the country’s science and technology minister Gabriela Jimenez shared footage which shows an obliterated building which she says housed the mathematics department at the IVIC. On top of this, Jimenez said that four other IVIC buildings were targeted for destruction: the physics, chemistry, ecology, and nuclear research centers.

“Two missiles struck the area directly,” Jimenez wrote on Telegram referencing the mathematics center, per AFP which translated the comment. “The attack was total: these areas housed servers and equipment essential to our computer networks that were completely devastated.”

The minister characterized the attacks as an “unprecedented act of imperial aggression.”

Why it was targeted is unclear. The IVIC is located on the southwestern outskirts of Caracas, nearly 11 miles away from the Fuerte Tiuna, the military installation from which Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were kidnapped by US special forces on Saturday.

In addition to the academic buildings, the governor of La Guaira, Jose Alejandro Teran, said the US air strikes destroyed a medicine warehouse located on the coastal city near Caracas.

“Tons of medicine burned to ash, tons of food,” Teran said in a video posted on social media. “Here are the results of what the bombs and missiles of the United States government have done… to destroy our warehouses full of medicine and food.”

Though Trump has emphasized the deaths of Venezuelan and Cuban soldiers, numerous civilians also lost their lives in the barrage. Those fatalities include 45-year old single mother Yohana Rodríguez Sierra, who was killed by a US missile. At least one of Sierra’s daughters was injured in the missile strike.

At least 150 US war planes and drones took part in the devastation, which the Trump administration and American media have characterized as a “precision operation.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As details emerge regarding the prediction betting scandal surrounding the US attacks on Venezuela, it’s becoming harder and harder to imagine any explanation other than the obvious: that an insider took advantage of nonpublic knowledge to make a quick buck.

Fresh reporting by the Wall Street Journal found that the anonymous bettor on Polymarket doubled down on their wager just five hours before over 150 US aircraft rocked the nation’s capital of Caracas. At least 80 civilians and military personnel have died from the US attacks, which satisfied the conditions of the anonymous bettor’s wager — netting them a cool $410,000.

What’s really astonishing is the timing of the bets placed. The WSJ breakdown shows just how close the mysterious insider came to the wire: on January 2nd, between 8:38 and 9:58pm, the bettor took out over $20,000 betting on an eminent attack on Venezuelan soil. At 10:46pm, president Donald Trump issued orders authorizing the military strike — not even an hour after the final bet had been placed.

At around 1:00am on January 3rd, explosions began to shake Caracas, destroying government buildings, civilian apartments, and even technical buildings at the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research. By 8:41am that same morning, the trader began to cash out their earnings — some $410,000, likely won at an unspeakable cost.

Making matters even more suspicious is the fact that the account was only one week old by the time the strikes hit, as political researcher Tyson Brody pointed out on social media.

Sure, it’s possible that someone registered a brand new account and made a series of unfathomably lucky bets, with no insider information, that just happened to pay off spectacularly.

But given the incredible timing, it also seems likely that the insider was someone either within the Trump administration or US armed forces — or someone else with advance knowledge of the attacks, like an employee at one of the media companies that knew about the administration’s plans before they happened, but chose not to report on them.

“It’s more likely than not that this was an insider,” Polymarket analyst Tre Upshaw told the WSJ. “That’s a lot of money to put in at that price, without a lot of news.”

As the WSJ notes, insider trading — placing profitable bets based on nonpublic information — is heavily regulated when it comes to the stock market, with major penalties for violations. When it comes to prediction markets like Polymarket, however, it’s the wild wild west, in part thanks to Trump’s own policy moves throughout his second term in office.

Earlier this week, Democratic representative Richie Torres introduced a bill which would penalize insider trading for all government officials on prediction markets, though the final vote remains a long way off — if it comes at all.

            <div id="article-text">Months before it mysteriously vaporized into thin air, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency ravaged the National Weather Service, leading to severe staffing shortages.

While the Trump administration promised to rehire most of the around 550 lost jobs at the agency last summer, effectively admitting that DOGE had gone too far, the agency’s offices across the country are still struggling with many roles that remain unfilled.

And given the latest blunder, those who remain are seemingly struggling to keep up — relying on flawed AI tech to come up with broken visuals for social media feeds.

As the Washington Post reports, the National Weather Service was caught posting an AI-generated weather map that hallucinated names for towns in Idaho.

A graphic forecasts “gusty south winds tonight” and shows a map that lays out the names of nonexistent towns, like “Orangeotilld” and “Whata Bod” — an unintentionally hilarious hallucination that sounds more like an old timey dirty joke than an actual place where people live.

The offending artwork was taken down on Monday, the same day WaPo notified the agency.

Experts say that the painful blunder could undercut trust in the agency and lead to confusion.

It also perfectly highlights the glaring shortcomings of AI tech that continue to lead to similar embarrassing incidents as the Trump administration pushes hard for the tech’s adoption by government agencies. Last month, for instance, it hired 1,000 specialists for a “Tech Force” to build AI.

But despite plenty of enthusiasm and resources being allocated to advancing the tech, baffling and easily avoided mistakes are falling through the cracks, as the latest incident goes to show.

It’s not even the first time a NWS office was caught posting lazy AI slop on social media. In November, the service in Rapid City, South Dakota, posted a map that included illegible location names, leading to widespread mockery.

The NWS told WaPo in a statement that using AI for public-facing content is uncommon, but technically not prohibited.

“Recently, a local office used AI to create a base map to display forecast information, however the map inadvertently displayed illegible city names,” NWS spokeswoman Erica Grow Cei told the newspaper. “The map was quickly corrected and updated social media posts were distributed.”

Cei added that “NWS will continue to carefully evaluate results in cases where AI is implemented to ensure accuracy and efficiency, and will discontinue use in scenarios where AI is not effective.”

But the damage has already been done. As flawed generative AI tools continue to be used carelessly, without the necessary follow-up work of checking for hallucinations, experts warn that agencies like NWS could inflict serious damage to their reputation and authority.

“If there’s a way to use AI to fill that gap, I’m not one to judge,” weather and climate communication expert Chris Gloninger told WaPo. “But I do fear that in the case of creating towns that don’t exist, that kind of damages or hurts the public trust that we need to keep building.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June 2025, Donald Trump Jr. proudly announced the founding of a mobile operator called Trump Mobile, including a mobile virtual network operator offering services for $47.45 a month, and a gaudy-looking, gold-colored, $499 smartphone that was supposedly going to be manufactured in the United States.

The device, as experts quickly pointed out at the time, looked an awful lot like a mid-tier Android phone from a Chinese smartphone company, drawing plenty of skepticism.

But despite promising that the phone would be released in 2025, the company was seemingly caught off guard by the dawn of a new year, with the Financial Times reporting on December 31 that Trump Mobile was delaying the launch of the handheld, dubbed T1, blaming the government shutdown. (How exactly the shutdown impacted the private business remains unclear.)

Beyond having embarrassingly little to show and failing to abide by its own deadlines, the company has walked back one of its biggest claims, a clear attempt to distinguish itself from its competitors. As the Associated Press points out, after announcing that the T1 would be made entirely in the US, the company’s website now claims the device will have an “American-proud” design — a meaningless tagline that makes it sound a lot like the device, if it ever gets made, will be built somewhere else.

It’s likely that Trump Jr. finally realized that producing a smartphone in the US could be far more expensive, making such a $499 device majorly unprofitable. That’s something we’ve known for quite some time now, as exemplified by Apple’s plans to move production of its US iPhones from China to India. The plans greatly angered his dad, president Donald Trump, who insisted it was possible to build iPhones in America by boosting domestic manufacturing by heavily taxing imports, forcing Apple to adjust its supply chains.’

Trump’s monetary policies and steep tariffs have driven up costs, making a US-built smartphone an even taller ask.

“The concept of making iPhones in the US is a nonstarter,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said last year, estimating that a price tag for an iPhone could triple if made in the US.

In other words, Trump Mobile failing to live up to its promises since its founding last summer isn’t surprising in the least.

“We have always been quite skeptical about this phone,” International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo told the Associated Press.

For the time being, Trump Mobile is slinging used iPhones and Samsung Galaxy smartphones for prices up to $630.

“Maybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,” Jeronimo added.

Nobody knows whether the T1 is pure vaporware — the company is still collecting $100 deposits — or a misguided attempt to cash in on Trump’s unsuspecting supporters, who may not be clued in to the fact that they could be investing in a middling foreign-made smartphone.

Besides, $500 gets you a pretty decent phone these days — without ostentatious gold and a close affiliation with a president who has a decades-long track record of launching and sinking well over a dozen businesses.

            <div id="article-text">The tech industry’s insistence on cramming AI into virtually every aspect of their consumer-facing offerings, from AI apps you can’t uninstall to hallucinating assistants that nobody asked for, has been nothing short of insufferable.

Tech enthusiasts and average consumers alike have watched helplessly as software and hardware they rely on to research, work, game, and keep in touch have turned into testing grounds for unproven AI tech — often without their consent.

Tech giant Microsoft has been at the epicenter of the resulting blowback, bearing the full brunt of the rage felt by many fed up with having AI shoved down their throat. It’s inundated its Windows 11 operating system with annoying AI features following the company’s doubling down on what it calls the “AI PC” last year, frustrating countless users, and most recently spawning the pejorative of “Microslop.”

Thankfully, vendors are finally starting to pay attention. As PCGamer reports, Windows PC maker Dell admitted at this year’s CES that things have really gotten out of hand.

Their executives are willing to say the quiet part out loud — that nobody is scrambling to buy an “AI PC.”

“One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, said during a pre-CES briefing, as quoted by the publication. “So, a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”

“We’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device — in fact everything that we’re announcing has an [neural processing unit] in it — but what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” he admitted. “In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

It’s a notable change of tune, suggesting a promising sea change in the perspective of tech manufacturers. It’s a refreshing new perspective after years of companies promising us that all we needed in life was a little bit more AI.

But whether the company developing the operating system of Dell’s PCs will agree with the assessment that consumers ahve had enough remains to be seen.

In a rambling year-end post on LinkedIn, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took umbrage with the term “slop,” arguing that “[w]e need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication.”

Nadella fumed that the company’s tripling down on AI will continue to be a “messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Indeed, tech companies like Microsoft and Dell have a lot still to prove until they can realize on their lofty promises about what AI can do.

For now, many new AI features remain infuriatingly useless, making us wonder if all of the risk and frustration will eventually be worth it in the end.

The fact that Dell is worried its AI-first approach may be hindering it from reaching new customers and making new sales, though, is telling.

Beyond Terwilliger’s eureka moment, Dell also admitted at CES that killing off its much-beloved line of XPS laptops was a mistake, officially reviving it for 2026 — and judging by the elated reactions the move has garnered, it was likely the right move.

Now, if only the hype surrounding AI hadn’t caused an astronomical rise in PC component prices…

            <h2>Why this VC thinks 2026 will be ‘the year of the consumer’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/why-this-vc-thinks-2026-will-be-the-year-of-the-consumer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Investment in consumer tech startups has been in a downturn since 2022, as a turbulent macroeconomic climate and rising inflation have made VCs skittish about consumer spending power. For the past couple of years, most AI investment has focused on winning over enterprise customers, who provide fat checks, multi-year contracts, and quick paths to scale.

But one VC sees the consumer sector gearing up for a comeback in 2026.

“This is gonna be the year of the consumer,” said Vanessa Larco, partner at the venture firm Premise and a former partner at NEA, on this week’s episode of the Equity podcast.

Larco says that even though enterprises have big budgets and a frantic desire to implement AI solutions, adoption often stalls because “they don’t know where to start,” Larco says.

“The fun thing about consumer and prosumer…is that people already have in mind what they want to use it for,” Larco continued. “And so they purchase it, and if it meets the need, they just keep using it.”

In other words, adoption is quicker, and startups building AI products don’t have to guess whether they’ve actually achieved product-market fit or have just won a contract.

“If you’re selling to consumers, you’ll know very quickly if it’s fitting a need or not, and you’ll know quickly whether you need to pivot or make some changes to your product or totally scrap it and start something totally different,” Larco said.

And in today’s anxiety-inducing economy, consumer tech products that manage to scale demonstrate an especially strong product-market fit.

There are early indications that consumer tech is having a moment. Late last year, OpenAI launched apps in ChatGPT, allowing users to shop with the Target app, scour the housing market with Zillow, book trips with Expedia, or make a Spotify playlist, all through the ChatGPT chatbot experience.

“AI is gonna feel like concierge-like services, which will do everything for you that you have in mind,” Larco said. “The question is, which of it should be specialized, and which should be general purpose?”

Or put differently, as OpenAI works to make ChatGPT the new operating system of the consumer internet, which legacy companies – like Tripadvisor or WebMD – will continue to exist in their own right, and which will get eaten by OpenAI?

While Larco does think 2026 is going to be a “gangbuster” year for M&A, she’s interested in investing in startups that “OpenAI isn’t going to want to kill.”

“OpenAI doesn’t manage real-world assets,” she said. “I don’t think they’ll build an Airbnb competitor because I don’t think they’re gonna want to manage homes…I don’t think they’re going to build any of these marketplaces that require real humans because they don’t want to manage the humans.”

Aside from which startups can fill the gaps, Larco is watching out for what happens if OpenAI “decides to pull an Apple or Android where they take a 30% cut of all the traffic they send you.”

“Is Airbnb gonna want to play ball with that?” she asked.

Overall, Larco predicts new monetization strategies and fresh business models will emerge from the evolved consumer experience online.

While doomscrolling on Instagram about Trump’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Larco noticed something. She had come to the platform to get news on the escalating crisis, but instead she was overwhelmingly flooded with AI-generated Maduro slop.

While deepfakes have been steadily becoming mainstream on social media, this was one of the first major news events where AI-generated slop muddied the waters of the truth.

“At that point, I was like, if I’m just gonna be watching AI-generated videos and photos, I want it to be funny,” she said.

Larco says she has been inundated with enough realistic-looking AI videos on social media that she just assumes it’s all AI at this point, and she’s not alone. If we all start to assume that nothing we see on Meta’s platforms or TikTok is real anymore, the question will be, where do you get the real stuff?

Larco says others might fill in the gaps of where to find truthful, non-AI content as platforms like Reddit and Digg make moves to verify humanity. But for Meta? Maybe it just becomes an entertainment company, a platform for user-generated short films.

“I think we should move on from getting your news from [Meta],” Larco said. “You are just getting funny videos from there. It’s not social media. It’s just gaming and entertainment media.”

When Meta acquired AI agent startup Manus last week, many saw it as an enterprise play. Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen.

Larco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute.

“Some things are better with voice than a screen,” she said. “And because voice sucked, we needed the screen as a crutch. But I would love to start separating out what things are really better on a screen and what things are just better with audio.”

Getting answers to questions her kids ask about what the tallest building is? Definitely voice. Taking out her phone to type in the question now feels “archaic,” Larco said.

“I think it’ll be really fun for designers because they finally get to pick and choose what form factor is better for what use cases,” she said.

            <h2>Hands on with a prototype of Clicks’ Communicator, a new BlackBerry-like smartphone</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/hands-on-with-a-prototype-of-clicks-communicator-a-new-blackberry-like-smartphone/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The BlackBerry is back, sort of. Mobile keyboard maker Clicks Technology last week announced its debut phone, the $499 Communicator, which sports a physical keyboard. The company is also offering a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that fits on any device.

At CES, TechCrunch chatted with Clicks’ chief marketing officer and co-founder, Jeff Gadway, and went hands-on with the latest prototype of the upcoming smartphone.

The device offers a BlackBerry-like keyboard and messaging-focused touchscreen, and runs Android 16 under the hood, which means the Communicator can run any Android app. The company has partnered with the minimalist launcher, Niagara Launcher, to display apps on the homescreen. Other apps are within easy reach via a scrollable list.

Reception for the new devices has been better than expected, Gadway told TechCrunch. Although he declined to share sales numbers, he said that over the past week, the company was making a sale every 6.5 seconds between both devices.

While the prototype we tried was not a fully functional phone, it’s the same size and weight as the device that’s preparing to ship later this year, giving an initial feel for what it would be like to use the Communicator. Onboard storage lands at 256 gigabytes, with expandable microSD storage of up to 2 terabytes of data. The device will also sport a 4000mAh silicon-carbon battery and is currently weighing in around 170 grams (or 6 oz). Underneath the back is where your nano-SIM card will go.

The phone also comes with interchangeable back covers that you can pop off to change its look. While not present on the prototype, the cover will have a small notch at the top and then a little finger pick at the bottom.

In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.

That’s where the device’s light-up side button can help. Called the “Signal Light,” the button can be configured to glow with different colors or patterns when you receive messages from certain people, groups or apps. So you can be sure to respond if it’s your boss or the kids contacting you and ignore less important notifications.

The tactile, physical keys feel good, though the prototype’s version may actually be a little less “clicky” than the final product. (There’s a debate on whether the keys should have 110 grams of pressure or 120 or 130 grams, and feedback so far is that the latter figures are winning.)

With less pressure, the keys feel softer, which could be more accessible for those who haven’t used a BlackBerry before. But people who type fast tend to prefer more clicky keys because there’s more feedback.

“This is the stuff that Michael Fisher and myself and Kevin Michaluk fight over all the time,” said Gadway, referring to his co-founders. “We’re fighting over grams.”

The keys and the screen are also at the same vertical height, so you can seamlessly move from the keyboard to the touchscreen.

The Clicks Communicator comes with a fixed-focus, hole-punch front camera that can capture 24-megapixel photos. The rear camera features optical image stabilization and electronic image stabilization for video, and can capture 50-megapixel images.

The phone runs on a 4-nanometer, MediaTek 5G IoT processor, with 8 gigabytes of RAM.

The Communicator’s will have a 4.03-inch AMOLED display at 1,080 x 1,200 resolution. Wired charging is supported at up to 18 watts, and wireless charging at up to 15 watts. The device is also Qi compatible and Android Strongbox-ready, which will appeal to security-minded customers.

The phone has other standard features too, like GPS, NFC, and will offer five years of security updates as well as Android updates through Android 20.

The device is expected to ship in the second half of 2026.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/gmail-debuts-a-personalized-ai-inbox-ai-overviews-in-search-and-more/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has unveiled a new AI Inbox for Gmail that’s designed to provide a personalized overview of your tasks and keep you informed about important updates. Gmail is also launching AI Overviews in search and a Grammarly-like “Proofread” feature. Additionally, Gmail is bringing several AI features that were previously available only to paid users to all users.

The new AI Inbox tab features two sections: “Suggested to-dos” and “Topics to catch up on.” The first section displays summaries of top priority emails that require an action, such as a reminder that you have a bill due tomorrow or that you need to call your dermatologist to confirm your mailing address so they can ship your prescription refill.

Under the “Topics to catch up on” section, you’ll see updates such “Your Lululemon return is being processed, and your order of Metal Vent Tech shirts has been delivered” and “Your end-of-year statement is now available from Wealthfront.” These different updates are grouped into different categories, such as “Finances” and “Purchases.”

“This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back, showing you what you need to do and when you need to do it,” said Blake Barnes, VP, Product at Google, in a briefing with reporters. “Don’t worry, the traditional inbox will remain available. This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.”

Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months.

With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.

For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.

“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”

This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.

Google says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.

As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences.

For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It’ll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It’s essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.

By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.

Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.

While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail’s “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users. These features were previously only available to paying subscribers.

Help Me Write can help you compose an email from a single prompt, while AI Overviews for threaded emails provide summaries of longer email threads with multiple replies. Suggested Replies use the context of conversations to offer relevant responses that match your tone and style.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spangle, an AI e-commerce startup founded by former Bolt CEO Maju Kuruvilla, has raised $15 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $100 million after the investment.

Led by NewRoad Capital Partners, the all-equity Series A round comes over a year after the Seattle-based startup raised a $6 million seed round at a $30 million pre-money valuation. Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup.

Retailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand’s website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts.

Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview.

Traffic flowing through Spangle’s platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures.

At the core of Spangle’s approach is a simple idea: instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle’s AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment.

Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.

“We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer’s catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically.

Spangle’s software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer’s vice president of performance marketing.

Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the one-click checkout company Bolt and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th.

Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle’s focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce.

Spangle’s approach also aligns with a shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor.

Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves.

Currently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams.

With the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization.

            <div id="article-text">Apple announced Wednesday that JPMorgan Chase is the new issuer of the Apple Card, replacing Goldman Sachs. Apple said that the transition will likely take up to 24 months.

While Apple is changing its banking partner, the Apple Card will continue to use the Mastercard network for payments. For consumers, nothing is changing at the moment, including for those applying for new cards.

JPMorgan said that the deal would bring over $20 billion in card balances to Chase. The Wall Street Journal noted that Goldman Sachs is offloading this amount at a $1 billion discount. Goldman Sachs said that for the fourth quarter of 2025, it expects a $2.2 billion provision for credit losses related to the forward purchase commitment.

News that the Apple-Goldman partnership would end has been swirling around for a few years now. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan was in line to become Apple’s new partner.

Apple launched its credit card in 2019 in partnership with Goldman Sachs without late fees or penalty interest rates. The card offers up to 3% daily cashback on purchases from Apple and other select partners; 2% from using Apple Pay; and 1% from using the physical card.

            <div id="article-text">Waymo has spent the past three years refining and testing a minivan-like vehicle made by Chinese automaker Zeekr. And now, before this robotaxi joins Waymo’s official commercial fleet, it’s getting a new name, the company told TechCrunch.

The Zeekr RT robotaxi will now be named Ojai (pronounced “oh-hi”) — after the village in the Topatopa Mountains above Los Angeles that is known for its arts community and focus on wellness.

Waymo’s official explanation, per spokesperson Chris Bonelli, is that the company determined the U.S. public isn’t familiar with the Zeekr brand. That branding may even carry through to the rider experience. Apparently, when customers eventually get into the Ojai, the robotaxi will greet them with an “Oh hi” and their name. Cute.

Of course, in the U.S. it might not hurt to ditch the name of a Chinese automaker either.

For those unfamiliar, Waymo first struck a partnership with Geely Holding Group-owned Zeekr in 2021. Waymo showed off a concept of a purpose-built robotaxi the following year at a splashy event in Los Angeles. The prototype was based on a version of Zeekr’s  SEA-M architecture designed for “future mobility products” like robotaxis and logistics vehicles.

Notably, the prototype didn’t have a steering wheel. But the Ojai one, which was shown off at CES 2026, does.

The Zeekr RT (now Ojai) has gone through some fine-tuning over the years as it has gone through development and testing in cities like Phoenix and San Francisco. Last year at CES, Waymo gave the robotaxi the now-retired name of Zeekr RT and showcased some of its hardware, including 13 cameras, four lidar, six radar, an array of external audio receivers, and the tiniest sensor wipers you’ve ever seen.

That hardware suite is the same. But the paint color has been tweaked, according to the company. Waymo told TechCrunch the paint color, which had a blueish tint, is now more silver.

All of these final tweaks have happened ahead of Ojai’s imminent launch into commercial service. Waymo employees, and their family and friends, are now able to hail the Zeekr van in San Francisco and Phoenix — typically one of the last steps before it becomes available to the public.

Waymo is in the midst of a rapid expansion. The company, which offers a commercial robotaxi service in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, plans to launch in a dozen more cities over the next year. Those cities include Denver, Las Vegas, and London.

            <h2>What the Second Law of Thermodynamics Reveals About Being Human</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/the-mattering-instinct-rebecca-newberger-goldstein-book-review/685536/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Philosophers are generally expected to display wisdom and calm in the face of existential questions. I am just not one of those philosophers. I spent 30 years racing away from these thoughts by running and swimming obsessively, pretending that I had no physical limits. Certain evasions are bound to fail: At 40, I suffered a cardiac arrest after an ill-advised treadmill workout. The sheer physicality of the event—the stopped heart, the failing body, the onerous recovery—threw into sharp relief a question that had always lurked beneath the surface: Does my life have a purpose? Or, put another way, how can I justify my existence? This dilemma gnaws at us in times of crisis and whispers to us in quiet moments of self-reflection. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s new book, The Mattering Instinct, helped me understand this feeling, to see it not as a personal quirk or a philosophical indulgence but as a fundamental aspect of what it means to be human.

We are, Goldstein asserts, “creatures of matter who long to matter.” This phrase captures the central paradox of the human condition: We are physical beings governed by the indifferent laws of nature, yet we are consumed by an obsession with our own significance. Her book is about, as she puts it, “a missing piece in the puzzle of understanding ourselves, one another, and our troubled times.” Goldstein, a philosopher and novelist known for her ability to bridge the worlds of science and the humanities, undertakes an ambitious project. She seeks to trace the origin of this profound desire and redefine what it means for a human life to flourish. She comes to a somewhat-surprising conclusion: that happiness isn’t always attainable or even desirable, but that anyone can achieve a good life by working to create order out of nature’s chaos.

Goldstein’s analysis hinges on an unexpected concept: the second law of thermodynamics. This is the principle of entropy, the inexorable tendency of any closed system to slide from order into chaos. Entropy is why houses fall into ruin, relationships fray, and bodies age. Life, in this framework, becomes a temporary act of defiance. Every living thing, Goldstein writes, is an intricate, energy-driven project engaged in a “ceaseless struggle against entropy.”

Using the “mattering map”—a classification system Goldstein first developed in her 1983 novel, The  Mind-Body Problem—she explains that this struggle manifests in different ways in different types of people. These types include the “heroic striver,” who believes the meaning of life is found in the next A+; the “transcender,” who seeks fulfillment in a relationship with the divine;  the “competitor,” who is motivated by defeating others; and the “socializer,” who seeks to matter by mattering to others.  I am—for better and occasionally for much worse—a heroic striver, which probably explains why I almost killed myself on that treadmill.

We each resist entropy in our own way, but in every case we are enacting a primitive, biological imperative that Goldstein refers to as self-mattering. Every organism is metabolically programmed to prioritize its own survival. “Biology’s response to the supreme law of physics,” she writes, “is what makes self-mattering deeper than any instinct, making it, rather, the organizing principle behind all the instincts.” If our genes could speak, “they would make for the best of self-esteem coaches,” she imagines. They would “incessantly and urgently exhort the organism forward,” saying, “You are special, oh so special.” This universal drive is the raw material of our story, as Goldstein tells it, but it is not the finished product. The uniquely human drama begins when people start to reflect back on this instinct.

This is the book’s central transformation. According to Goldstein, the leap from being simply a living thing to being a human occurs through the act of self-reflection, which turns us into what she dubs Homo iustificans—the creature who needs a reason. People’s capacity to “step back and survey themselves,” as the philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote, reveals a stark dissonance between our biological drive to survive and the fact that every life ends in death anyway. This realization gives rise to what Goldstein calls “the mother of all mattering questions—Do I matter?” The biological sense of importance is no longer enough. Instead, “We need to convince ourselves that our own self-mattering is warranted,” she writes. “We long to demonstrate that the reason we subjectively feel that we matter is that we objectively do.” That desire is what Goldstein defines as the “mattering instinct.”

Here, Goldstein makes a pivotal philosophical claim: Our inherent human dignity lies not in some immutable essence like a soul or a divine image, but in this very struggle. Recasting the story of Eden—a world without entropy—she argues that the expulsion from paradise was not a fall but a step into humanity, the moment we became “values-seeking creatures.” Goldstein isn’t the first philosopher to argue that we are driven by the quest to justify our existence, but she sees it as an overriding instinct, even when our attempts are flawed or lead us astray.

With this “mattering instinct” established as humans’ core driver, Goldstein redefines the goal of a well-lived life. She asks readers to look beyond what she considers a modern obsession with happiness, which she characterizes as a fleeting emotion, a mere “surge of neurotransmitters.” The true aim, she argues, is the richer, classical concept of “eudaimonia”—a deep and reflective sense that one’s life is being lived well. She borrows from Aristotle to underscore the point: Eudaimonia “is not found in amusement; for it would be absurd if the end were amusement, and our lifelong efforts and suffering aimed at amusing ourselves.” This thriving rests, instead, in feeling that our life is significant both to ourselves and to others.

Crucially, this state of flourishing can, and often does, coexist with great suffering. To illustrate this, Goldstein turns to figures such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, who experienced constant mental anguish yet who exclaimed on his deathbed, “Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life.” This, Goldstein contends, was a statement not about happiness but about eudaimonia. His life, for all its misery, had been ferociously engaged in a mattering project: He developed what is arguably the most rigorous philosophical system of the 20th century, the goal of which was to understand the limits of language and thought. This heroic undertaking, which brought him no small amount of distress, gave Wittgenstein’s life coherence and purpose.

Similarly, Goldstein examines the American philosopher William James, who had an existential crisis in his youth. In a thinly veiled anonymous account, James described the moment his sense of self collapsed: “Suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as if it came out of darkness, a horrible fear of existence,” he described it. “It was as if something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became a mass of quivering fear.” James’s recovery came from a decision to believe in his own “individual reality and creative power”—which contributed greatly to the field of empirical psychology, expanded American pragmatism, and reshaped theology in the 20th century. Both men struggled mightily in service of a project that made their lives feel not just bearable, but meaningful.

Of course, certain mattering projects are ill-conceived from the start, as Goldstein shows through the story of the former white supremacist Frank Meeink. According to his book, Autobiography of a Recovering Skinhead, after severe emotional and physical abuse during his childhood left him feeling worthless, Meeink was desperate never to be a victim again. He found a perverse sense of belonging and destiny in the neo-Nazi skinhead movement, which convinced him that he was, as he put it, a “warrior” and that being white was “all that mattered,” turning his extreme self-doubt into destructive power. Later, while in prison, Meeink grew close with Black inmates. After his release, a Jewish employer showed him unconditional respect and helped replace his hate with constructive self-worth. Transformed by these experiences, Meeink ultimately channeled his need to matter into a heroic project: dedicating his life to fighting extremism.

If the mattering instinct originates in life’s resistance to entropy, then this same principle can help provide a standard for what Goldstein calls “getting mattering right.” A flourishing, morally good life, she proposes, is counter-entropic: It increases “the spread of flourishing, knowledge, love, joyfulness, peace, kindness, comity, beauty.” A life lived wrongly is one that aligns with entropy, increasing the world’s sum of chaos, cruelty, and dissolution. “People’s effects on entropy,” she states plainly, “provide the best overarching means I know to assess their lives.”

Nowhere is this vision more powerfully embodied than in the subject of the book’s final portrait: Lou Xiaoying, an impoverished Chinese woman who survived by scavenging through rubbish and died around 2012. Over the course of her 88 years, she found and raised more than 30 abandoned baby girls left to die in dumpsters and on roadsides. As her adopted daughter Juju recalls, “If she had the strength enough to collect garbage, then how could she not recycle something as important as human lives?” Lou Xiaoying’s existence was one of almost uninterrupted  hardship, yet Juju describes her as happy, fulfilled by a purpose that was profoundly counter-entropic. She created life, connection, and love where society had left only waste and decay.

The Mattering Instinct is a testament to the idea that humans find purpose when, as the poet Rumi wrote, we “let the beauty we love be what we do.” In a world fractured by competing claims on what’s important, Goldstein offers a vision that is both intellectually resonant and humane, reminding us that the struggle to justify our existence is the very thing that makes our existence matter.

            <h2>A High-Seas Gambit Humiliates Putin</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/russia-putin-trump-venezuela-oil-tankers-marinera/685544/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past two weeks, Russian authorities tried hard to protect an oil tanker that the Americans wanted to seize. On Christmas Eve, Moscow permitted the ship to fly the Russian tricolor, a symbolic warning for U.S. forces to keep their distance. The Russian foreign ministry then issued a demand for the Americans to leave the ship alone, and the Russian navy provided an escort, which reportedly included a submarine. None of it did any good.

Yesterday, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated Orthodox Christmas on a military base near Moscow, U.S. troops descended from helicopters onto the deck of the tanker, dealing the Kremlin a humiliation such as it has seldom faced on the high seas. Some Russian commentators called the raid an act of war, though the official response from Moscow sounded a lot more cautious: The foreign ministry urged the United States to respect the rights of the Russian citizens on board and to “put no obstacles for their soonest return to the motherland.”

The standoff, reminiscent of the tensest moments of the Cold War, deepened the dilemma Putin faces. The Trump administration kicked off the year with a series of belligerent moves, first sending troops into Caracas to arrest Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, then threatening a takeover of Greenland. Putin kept silent as the U.S. brought Maduro, his ally, to New York to face charges of trafficking drugs. While the Russian foreign ministry called on the U.S. to avoid “any further escalation,” some analysts speculated that the U.S. moves against Venezuela might offer benefits for Putin, heralding an era of great-power politics in which the U.S., Russia, and China carve up the world into their spheres of influence. But the American seizure of the tanker, known as the Marinera, was a reminder that between Moscow and Washington, a vast power differential remains.

The U.S. under Donald Trump has aggressively pushed Russia out of Latin America while giving no apparent ground in Europe. That dynamic could change if Trump makes good on his threats to take Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. Several European leaders, including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, have warned that such a move could spell the end of NATO, granting Putin his long-held wish to dismantle the alliance. In a post on social media yesterday, Trump sought to give his European allies at least a modicum of reassurance. “We will always be there for NATO,” Trump said. The United States under his leadership, he added, is the “only Nation that China and Russia fear and respect.”

Among Russian pundits and propaganda outlets, reactions to the Marinera’s fate reflected a mix of outrage and defeatism, as they realized that the U.S. has no intention of treating Moscow as an equal. “No one is carving up anything with us,” Dmitry Agranovsky, a Russian TV commentator, wrote on social media. “We are just the next in line.”

Some of the most influential military bloggers in Russia demanded an aggressive response from the Russian navy. “The Americans are not afraid of Russia,” wrote Alexei Dzermant, a political observer in neighboring Belarus, a Russian ally. “There obviously won’t be any trade of Venezuela for Ukraine.”

The idea for such a trade came up during the first Trump administration. Fiona Hill, who oversaw White House policy toward Moscow at the time, told Congress in 2019 that the Russians wanted to “make some very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,” effectively suggesting that both of the nuclear superpowers should give each other free rein in their respective neighborhoods.

Hill recalled Russian diplomats and state media discussing the return of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century policy in which the U.S. resisted European influence over the Western Hemisphere while staying out of Europe’s affairs. In the spring of 2019, Hill traveled to Moscow on behalf of the White House to reject the notion of swapping Ukraine for Venezuela.

The idea surfaced again this week, when Trump touted the U.S. raid against Maduro as part of a new Monroe Doctrine—or as he called it, the “Donroe Doctrine”—that would shape his approach to international affairs. “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again,” Trump said in his announcement of Maduro’s arrest, on January 3.

Watching from Moscow, some members of the Russian political elite offered grudging praise for Trump while calling on the Kremlin to move with similar boldness. “Trump is showing us how we need to act,” the imperialist ideologue Aleksandr Dugin wrote on social media. “Right now, all of Russia is asking: Why do we not act this way toward our enemies?”

Dmitry Medvedev, the Putin acolyte and former president who now sits on the Kremlin’s security council, expressed much the same view in an interview with the state-run news agency Tass. He praised Trump and his team for “rigidly defending his country’s national interests, both political (with Latin America being the backyard of the United States) and economic (give us your oil and other natural resources).” In an apparent reference to the invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev added that the U.S. now has “nothing to reproach our country for.”

But the White House has shown none of the reciprocity Moscow seems to expect from what it sees as its fellow superpower. In the afterglow of the U.S. raid on Caracas, the Trump administration seems intent on asserting its claim to being the world’s preeminent decider, capable of imposing its will far beyond the Western Hemisphere. If the seizure of Russia’s ship in the North Atlantic did not make that clear enough, Pete Hegseth, the U.S. defense secretary, stated yesterday that the blockade of Venezuelan oil would be enforced “anywhere in the world.”

That kind of muscle flexing has long infuriated Putin. For nearly two decades, he has made it his mission to push back against what he describes as the hegemonic power of the United States. He first articulated this mission in a 2007 speech in Munich, when he declared that Russia would no longer tolerate the U.S. habit of using its military to get what it wanted. He has railed against American-led interventions in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan, calling them examples of an unbridled and intolerable “hyper-use of force.”

In 2011, when the U.S. and several of its European allies began a bombing campaign against the forces of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, Putin lashed out. “What troubles me is not the fact of the military intervention itself,” he said. “I am concerned by the ease with which decisions to use force are taken in international affairs.” In his memoir, The Back Channel, the former diplomat and CIA director William Burns recalls how the death of Qaddafi affected Putin, who would replay footage of the Libyan dictator being dragged from a drainpipe and beaten by insurgents.

Afterward, the Russian president became far more aggressive in trying to counter U.S.-military interventions. He sent warplanes in 2015 to defend his ally Bashar al-Assad, in Syria, from a coalition of insurgent groups and revolutionary forces, some of them backed by the United States. Putin’s defense minister at the time, Sergei Shoigu, later mused that the Russian intervention in Syria had dissuaded the U.S. from seeking to overthrow regimes it didn’t like, thus “breaking the chain of color revolutions,” such as the popular uprisings in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and elsewhere.

But the start of the Russian assault on Ukraine in 2022 forced Putin to scale back his global ambitions. He could not stop Islamist rebels from overthrowing Assad in 2024 and evicting Russia from its naval base in Syria. He offered little help to his allies in Iran last year when they came under attack from U.S. and Israeli warplanes. And he did nothing to save his ally in Caracas when Maduro’s turn came to face an American attack this weekend. The weapons that Venezuela had purchased from Russia over the years failed to shoot down a single American helicopter during the operation to detain the Venezuelan leader. “Seems those Russian air defenses didn’t quite work so well, did they?” Hegseth said in a taunting speech on Monday.

It remains to be seen how Russia might answer this latest round of American insults, but Putin’s options are severely limited by the demands of the war he started in Ukraine. The federal budget for the next three years envisions significant tax hikes to finance Russia’s enormous military spending (about 8 percent of GDP), and it will be sustainable only if the price of oil, Russia’s most important export, stays at an average of $70 a barrel.

Last month, the price of Russian crude sank to about half that level, and it could drop even lower if the U.S. manages to tap Venezuela’s oil reserves. One of Russia’s most influential billionaires, Oleg Deripaska, warned of the consequences after the U.S. swept into Caracas. “If our American ‘partners’ get the oil fields of Venezuela,” he wrote on social media, “they will control more than half of the world’s supplies of oil. And it looks like they plan to make sure that the price of our oil does not go higher than $50 per barrel.” At that level, Deripaska warned, it will be difficult for Putin’s version of state capitalism to make ends meet.

After the American move to seize Russian oil tankers, the Kremlin’s business model looks even shakier. Russia has relied on a “shadow fleet” of tankers to transport its oil to clients in China, India, and Turkey in circumvention of Western sanctions on its energy industry. The seizure of the Marinera suggests that this loophole will continue to tighten, leaving Putin less room to maneuver on the global stage, or even to finance his nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine. Yesterday morning, the U.S. seized another oil tanker close to Venezuela, suggesting that its campaign against the Russian shadow fleet is just beginning.</div>

            <h2>The Common Friendship Behavior That Has Become Strangely Fraught</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/01/venting-complaining-advice/685529/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A boogeyman haunts the realm of friendship advice: the friend who vents too much. Although people have surely been complaining since the dawn of language, and getting annoyed at one another about it for nearly as long, venting about how much other people are venting has lately gotten very loud. Etiquette books, advice columns, and talking-head TikToks have taken up the issue of over-venting. Complaining too much sometimes gets framed as not just irritating but “toxic,” and sharing problems is sometimes described as “trauma dumping.” Those on the receiving end of complaints bemoan their status as the “therapist friend.” The message is: Vent with caution.

Therapists and researchers I spoke with have also noticed a heightened anxiety among their patients and research subjects about venting. “It’s a real-life thing,” Peter Mallory, a sociologist at St. Francis Xavier University, told me. He said that when he interviews people about their friendships, he frequently hears them “talking about the burdens of other people coming to them when they need emotional support.” In turn, some people seem to be holding back from their friends for fear of burdening them. Blake Blankenbecler, a therapist in Charlotte, North Carolina, told me that she hears both sentiments from her clients: “I don’t want to be too much and My friend is too much right now.”

Some conflict within friendships over venting seems inevitable. Venting is complex; it can bring people closer, but it can also be emotionally draining. The impulse to conceal struggles from friends, or to resist listening to a friend’s complaints, however, is misguided: If people avoid sharing problems with one another, their relationships risk becoming less rich—and less rewarding.

The idea of venting was popularized by Sigmund Freud and his colleague Josef Breuer, who believed that catharsis of suppressed emotions was key to treating hysteria and neurosis. Freud wrote of “giving vent to the torments of the secret.” Anger was not the only emotion he thought needed release, but the idea of venting your frustration lest you explode has had real staying power. It still fuels a lot of conventional wisdom about how to deal with negative emotions, including tips to scream into a pillow, “let it out,” or “get something off your chest.” (And this concept of catharsis informed much of what we know as talk therapy today.)

Research, however, has shown that venting does not reduce anger but can actually fuel it—which may be why some people go so far as to say that you should never vent at all, to anyone. The self-help author and podcaster Mel Robbins has called venting a “trap” and instead recommends her “Let Them Theory,” which, as I understand it, advises people to just accept however others are acting and try not to be upset about it. Mark Manson, the author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, advocated against venting for other reasons: “Complaining is how weak people try to connect,” he said in a social-media video last year.

Still, venting can make people feel better, even if it doesn’t make them less enraged, because it has a social purpose. “We vent to connect, feel validated, etc and maybe even more energized to deal with the conflict,” Jennifer Parlarmis, a social psychologist at the University of San Francisco, told me in an email. “You feel better because you received social support but you are not less angry.” That support from another person can make the difference between a successful vent session and a dud. In one study, Parlarmis found that whether venters came away from an interaction with their moods improved depended on how the listener responded.

Venting can also bring people closer, much like sharing secrets can build intimacy. One way this happens, according to research by Jaimie Arona Krems, a social psychologist at UCLA, is when one friend vents to another about someone else. This kind of venting makes the listener likely to prefer the venter over the person being vented about. So it’s a way of solidifying a relationship, if a somewhat-manipulative way.

Despite the social benefits of venting, people can easily overdo it. Online, people frequently complain about friends’ constant negativity bringing them down. They aren’t wrong to worry about this; emotions are contagious. Complaining can lead to what is called “co-rumination,” or excessive dwelling on a problem in discussion—you can get caught up in a friend’s thought spiral and their emotions. Co-rumination is linked to depressive symptoms but also to higher-quality friendships, presumably because co-ruminators have people they trust to discuss problems with them. An interviewee in one of Mallory’s studies summed up the tension between the advantages and drawbacks of venting. At one point, she talked about the importance of friends sharing issues and giving one another advice: “For me, friendship means counseling,” she said. But later, she also said that she felt emotionally burned-out by paying attention to friends’ problems. Contradictorily, she saw “counseling her friends as both intimacy-building and a risk to her own wellbeing,” the researchers wrote.

Anti-venting partisans have some ideas for what people should do instead of complaining to their friends: journaling—or better yet, if you can afford it, going to therapy and paying someone to listen. (Reminders that “friends are not your therapists” abound on social media.) For those who do choose to vent to a friend, advice-givers suggest scheduling a time to talk about a tricky topic, so your friend isn’t blindsided; setting a timer for how long you’re going to complain; or—and this one comes up again and again—asking your friend for permission to vent before doing so.

This guidance implies that minimizing venting is almost a matter of etiquette, that asking for too much of others’ emotional energy is impolite. The advice also urges friends to behave in ways that are oddly formal. As Mallory pointed out, planning time to complain to a friend sounds “almost like booking an appointment with your therapist”—ironic, considering the imperative to not treat friends like therapists. These tips also focus on controlling and containing the mess of emotions that can come along with venting; yet the nature of both emotions and relationships is messy and unpredictable. “The most sustainable friendships,” Blankenbecler said, “value and create space for there to be some friction from time to time.”

And confining all of your venting to a journal or a therapist’s office could come at a real cost to relationships. If you never complain to your friends, Danielle Bayard Jackson, a friendship coach and the author of Fighting for Our Friendships, told me, you lose opportunities to signal trust, get “perspective from a person who knows and loves you,” and build intimacy. Jackson said that after she started going to therapy, she did ask for less from her friends. “It directly changed how I approached my friends,” she said. Her reach-outs for emotional support became “less frequent and intense.” She said that both therapy and prayer offered her help that her friends couldn’t. Still, Jackson didn’t stop complaining to her friends entirely. “Taking it totally off the table,” she said, “just feels kind of antithetical to friendship itself.”

That is what the venting debate is really about: friendship itself, and how friends should be. Should friendship be a haven from mess, or a safe space for it? Should friends support or avoid burdening one another? And, as Jackson put it, “what do you believe your friends owe you?” I don’t believe that friends owe one another unlimited time or energy. But they do owe one another, at least, compassion, reciprocity, and the generosity to not assume that a friend’s problems are only burdens.</div>

            <h2>An Underappreciated Variable in Sports Success</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/athletic-success-luck/685533/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chief among the burdens weighing upon the weary sports parent—worse than the endless commutes, the exorbitant fees, the obnoxious parents on the other team—is the sense that your every decision has the power to make or break your child’s future. Should your 11-year-old show up to her elementary-school holiday concert, even if it means missing a practice with the elite soccer team to which you’ve pledged 100 percent attendance? What if this turns out to be the fork in the road that consigns her to the athletic scrap heap?

These are heavy decisions—at least they are for me, a soccer dad who happens to have spent years writing about the science of athletic success. Making it to the pros, the conventional wisdom says, is a consequence of talent and hard work. Best-selling books have bickered over the precise ratio—whether, say, 10,000 hours of practice trumps having the so-called sports gene. But the bottom line is that you need a sufficient combination of both. If you’re talented enough and do the work, you’ll make it. If not—well, decisions (and holiday concerts) have consequences.

Rationally, stressing out over missing a single practice is ridiculous. Believing that it matters, though, can be strangely reassuring, because of the suggestion that the future is under your control. Forecasting athletic careers is an imperfect science: Not every top draft pick pans out; not every star was a top draft pick. Unexpected injuries aside, the imprecision of our predictions is usually seen as a measurement problem. If we could only figure out which factors mattered most—how to quantify talent, which types of practice best develop it—we would be able to plot athletic trajectories with confidence.

Unless, of course, this tidy relationship between cause and effect is an illusion. What if the real prerequisite for athletic stardom is that you have to get lucky?

Joseph Baker, a scientist at the University of Toronto’s Sport Insight Lab, thinks that the way talent development is usually framed leaves out this crucial ingredient. Baker is a prominent figure in the academic world of “optimal human development,” who moonlights as a consultant for organizations such as the Texas Rangers. He’s also a longtime skeptic of the usual stories we tell ourselves about athletic talent. The most prominent is that early performance is the best predictor of later performance. In reality,  many cases of early success just mean an athlete was born in the first months of the year, went through puberty at a young age, or had rich and highly enthusiastic parents.

This critique of talent is not entirely new. It’s been almost two decades since Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers spurred a cohort of hyper-ambitious soon-to-be parents to begin plotting January birth dates (or at least to tell people they were considering it). Over time, the debate about what factors actually matter has devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. If physical development isn’t the best predictor of long-term success, then it must be reaction time, or visual acuity, or hours of deliberate practice. The default assumption is that there must be something that reveals the presence of future athletic greatness.

Baker’s perspective changed, he told me, when he read Success and Luck, a 2016 book by the former Cornell University economics professor Robert H. Frank. Frank describes a hypothetical sports tournament whose outcome depends 49 percent on talent, 49 percent on effort, and 2 percent on luck. In mathematical simulations where as many as 100,000 competitors are randomly assigned values for each of these traits, it turns out that the winner is rarely the person with the highest combination of talent and effort. Instead, it will be someone who ranks relatively highly on those measures and also gets lucky.

This turns out to be something like a law of nature: It has been replicated and extended by others since Frank’s book came out. Among the most influential models is “Talent Versus Luck,” created by the Italian theoretical physicist Andrea Rapisarda and his colleagues, which simulates career trajectories over dozens of years and reaches the same conclusion. This model earned a 2022 Ig Nobel Prize “for explaining, mathematically, why success most often goes not to the most talented people, but instead to the luckiest.”

To Baker, these models suggest that it’s not just hard to reliably predict athletic futures; it’s impossible. He cites examples including a youth-soccer player for Northampton Town who missed a text message from the team’s manager telling him that he’d been dropped from the roster for an upcoming game. He showed up for the bus, went along for the ride, subbed in when another player got injured, impressed the manager, earned a spot for the rest of the season, and went on to play in the Premier League. Luck takes many forms, such as genetics, family resources, and what sports happen to be popular at a given place at a given time. But sometimes, it’s simply random chance: a gust of wind or an errant bounce or a missed text.

It’s easy to see how luck shapes individual moments in sport—how it changes the course of a game, a series, even an entire season. But what’s harder to accept is that luck might also play a role in longer arcs—not just what happens in games but who appears on the court in the first place. The more you reckon with this, the more disorienting it can be, as things start to feel ever more arbitrary and unfair. As Michael Mauboussin, an investor who writes about luck in his 2012 book, The Success Equation, put it to me: “Talking about luck really quickly spills into the philosophical stuff.”

You might think that the growing professionalization of youth sports offers an escape from this randomness—that by driving to this many practices and paying for that many coaches, you’re ensuring the cream will rise to the top. But the opposite is actually true, according to Mauboussin. In The Success Equation, he describes what he calls the “paradox of skill.” Now that every soccer hopeful is exhaustively trained from a young age, an army of relatively homogeneous talent is vying for the same prizes. “Everyone’s so good that luck becomes more important in determining outcomes,” Mauboussin said.

Baker and one of his colleagues at the University of Toronto, Kathryn Johnston, recently published a paper on the role of luck in athletic development in the journal Sports Medicine–Open. I felt a curious sense of relief when I read it. My daughters, who are 9 and 11, both play competitive soccer on teams requiring a level of commitment that I had naively thought went out of style with the fall of the Soviet Union. Seeing the evidence that future athletic success is not entirely predictable felt like a license for parents to loosen up a bit—to choose the holiday concert over the soccer practice without worrying about the long-term ramifications.

Linda Flanagan, the author of the 2022 book Take Back the Game and a frequent critic of today’s youth-sports culture, doesn’t share my optimism. She has no trouble believing that luck is involved with athletic success, but she doesn’t think that acknowledging this fact will change parental behavior. “Hell, they might double down on the investment in time and money, thinking that they need to give their child more chances to get lucky and impress the right coach,” she told me.

But that sort of luck—getting a job on your hundredth interview because the interviewer went to the same high school as you did, say—arguably is more about hustle than it is about serendipity. So is showing up to every soccer practice. Mauboussin’s definition of luck is narrower: It’s the factors you can’t control. No matter how much luck you try to “create” for yourself or your kids, some irreducible randomness might still make or break you.

To Baker, the takeaways from recognizing the role of luck are less about individual parents and more about how sports are organized. His advice to teams and governing bodies: “If there’s any way possible for you to avoid a selection, don’t select.” Keep as many athletes as you can in the system for as long as you can, and don’t allocate all of your resources to a chosen (and presumably lucky) few. When real-world constraints eventually and inevitably do require you to select—when you’re anointing these lucky few as your future stars, and casting out those who perhaps sang in one too many holiday concerts—try to leave the door open for future decisions and revisions. After all, Baker says, no matter how carefully you’ve weighed your predictions, “you’re probably wrong.”</div>

            <h2>Iraq Was Bad. This Is Absurd.</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/venezuela-iraq-hypocrisy/685547/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two decades ago, Richard N. Haass, a senior foreign-policy official in the George W. Bush administration, confessed that he would go to his grave not knowing why the United States had invaded Iraq. “A decision was not made,” Haass told me. “A decision happened, and you can’t say when or how.” I thought of this astonishing remark after Saturday’s military action in Caracas. President Donald Trump and his advisers have thrown out numerous justifications for seizing the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife and bringing them to New York for trial. None of them makes sense.

Maduro ruled Venezuela viciously and illegitimately, but Trump has no qualms about doing business with the vicious and illegitimate—he prefers them to democratically elected leaders. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told skeptics in Congress that the operation wasn’t an act of war at all, but a simple arrest based on Maduro’s indictment for drug trafficking. Then why, at the end of last year, did Trump pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the ex-president of Honduras who had been convicted of the same crime by an American court and sentenced to 45 years in prison?

If narco-terrorism is a threat to U.S. security, Venezuela is a relatively small player in the global narcotics trade; the chief drug it exports, cocaine, is not a mass killer of Americans like fentanyl is, and the probable destination of the alleged drug boats that U.S. forces have been bombing off the Venezuelan coast was Europe. If Trump wants to deport 600,000 Venezuelan migrants from the U.S., the political chaos left by a decapitated regime could increase the exodus to this country. If his concern was the intolerable oppression of the Venezuelan people, he would have demanded the release of political prisoners and planned for a democratic future rather than kept their tormentors in power. As for the oil that Trump craves, America doesn’t need Venezuela’s reserves, and tapping them would require years of investment in the country’s decayed infrastructure. In a New York Times report, Trump officials cited Maduro’s public dance moves to a techno remix as a final provocation.

Bush apparently decided to invade Iraq before he had settled on a specific cause. He wanted to assert American power after September 11, and a preventive war gave him a way. “Fuck Saddam,” he told a group of senators a full year before the invasion. “We’re taking him out.” The tragicomic improv act following the raid on Caracas suggests that Trump attacked Venezuela for the same reason: because he could. This is more often the case than we’d like to think. It would be comforting to believe that geopolitics is a nefarious conspiracy plotted by rational actors pursuing rational interests in a windowless room—but in the long history of human folly, we seldom know why events of the most momentous consequence even happened. “Foreign policy makes no sense,” the late foreign-policy expert Leslie Gelb liked to say.

The specter of Iraq hangs over Venezuela like a warning light. Trump seems to have taken Operation Iraqi Freedom as a guide to how not to conduct Operation Absolute Resolve: no year-long propaganda campaign to gin up public support; no congressional authorization; no speeches and votes at the United Nations; no coalition of the willing or of any other kind; no American troops on the ground for more than a few hours; no talk of human rights, elections, and postwar reconstruction; no change of regime at all. Iraq was a disaster in part because the Bush administration, wanting regime change without nation building, substituted wishful thinking for post-invasion planning. Now we might learn that wishful thinking is better than no thinking at all. The Trump administration appears to be making up the future of Venezuela on the fly.

The embrace of unilateralism, preemption, and torture in Iraq seemed to mark the start of a new era in U.S. foreign policy—endless, unrestrained war. A mountain of books, articles, and speeches declared America alone. But from the vantage point of the Trump era, we can see that Iraq was instead the last American war of the 80-year postwar period. Its architects might have been eager to break all constraints on their way to catastrophe, but Iraq was a final burst of hubris in an era still characterized by internationalism and democracy. Concepts such as humanitarian intervention and transitional justice were manipulated and abused by the Bush administration, but it wasn’t free to discard them. It felt compelled to hold several elections that were bound to give power to Iraqis who were aligned with America’s enemy, Iran.

In the 2002 National Security Strategy, Bush declared: “Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom.” Trump’s version of the same document, released in November, has nothing to say about any universal values, including freedom. It’s all about unilateral advantage, with a crudely transactional view of America’s relation to the rest of the world. It’s a clean break from the postwar years of internationalism that, although flawed, prevented another world war and created unprecedented conditions of freedom and prosperity, first in the West, then in the former colonial world.

Bush was guilty of being arrogant, reckless, naive, and incapable of self-judgment, but he believed in an American mission with enough zeal to start a foolish war on its behalf that did irreversible damage to the mission. To critics on both the right and the left, the post-9/11 “forever wars” in Iraq and Afghanistan brought disrepute to the entire project of an American-led liberal international order. The left wanted America to be more like Norway, peaceful and humanitarian. The right wanted America to be a stronghold of isolation. But Trump has shown that neither of these was on the menu of a superpower. The likeliest alternative to Pax Americana is naked imperialism.

Just as Bush’s messianic National Security Strategy foretold the Iraq War, the crude cynicism of Trump’s produced the raid in Caracas, where it is facing its first practical test. Since Saturday’s military action, Trump and his aides have been spouting threats about the United States military dominating the Western Hemisphere wherever the president wants. What began in Venezuela might well be repeated in Greenland, Cuba, Panama, or even Canada. What the U.S. can do it is free to do. Force is its own justification. Trump’s strategy recalls the era before World War II—one of dollar diplomacy and gunboat imperialism, spheres of dominion, puppet dictators, resource grabs, annexations, and the threat of larger wars among great powers. Only now those nations are armed with nuclear weapons, and America in 2026 is incomparably stronger than America was in 1926, and Calvin Coolidge was no Trump.

The clearest expression of Trump’s thought here, as always, comes from the mouth of Stephen Miller, the president’s deputy chief of staff and his homeland-security adviser. Miller is more coherent than the president, less self-seeking than the vice president, and more openly hateful than any member of the Cabinet and Congress. He’s a genuine ideologue with no conventional political ambitions, and his words make it impossible not to think of the 1930s: “America is for Americans and Americans only!” “At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” “The Democrat Party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization.” “We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil. They cannot imagine what they have awakened.”

With Venezuela, Miller is taking a public role in foreign policy. Like the rest of the leadership circle, he seems unworried by the prospect of civil war, insurgency, or prolonged chaos in post-Maduro Venezuela, indifferent to the fate of Venezuelans under the regime left in power by Trump and untroubled by the possibility of an American quagmire. He seems to have limitless faith in the ability of U.S. warships to work the administration’s will on another country and people. On Monday, Miller explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper why Venezuela is going to be run by Trump: “You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else, but we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.”

It’s a kind of candor that makes me miss the old American hypocrisy.</div>

Democratic Senator Mark Kelly is fluent in insult, particularly when it comes to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth: “unqualified,” like “a 12-year-old playing army.” In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers—all of them military or intelligence veterans—released a video telling current service members, “Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.”

President Donald Trump was predictably furious, writing on Truth Social, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” This week, Hegseth announced that his department had initiated proceedings to demote Kelly and reduce his pension pay.

Senator Kelly joined Radio Atlantic to discuss the implications of this brand of revenge: If the president can punish a sitting senator for making a video he doesn’t like, what could that mean for the average dissenting American? Or the average service member if asked to do something they don’t believe is lawful? Kelly elaborated on the personal reprisal but seemed equally exercised about the plight of the whole world.

This week, the White House pointedly said that using the military to take Greenland is an option. “That  would probably be the biggest mistake any president has made in the history of this country,” Kelly said.  “For us to threaten them, especially with force. That we’re just gonna take your stuff; we’re gonna take your territory. I mean, is that who we’ve become? That’s Russia. We are not that kind of a nation.”

This week on Radio Atlantic, we talk to Kelly about Hegseth, Greenland, Venezuela, the evolving role of the military under Trump, and the 15th anniversary of the shooting of his wife, the former congresswoman Gabby Giffords.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Democratic Senator Mark Kelly can be blunt, particularly on subjects he knows about. He served decades in the Navy, flying dozens of combat missions. Also, he’s an astronaut. So he has had a lot to say over the last few months about how the Trump administration has been using the military, at home and abroad—little of it positive.  [Music]

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. We could start in a lot of different places with Mark Kelly on the subject of [Donald] Trump and the U.S. military: appointing Pete Hegseth as the defense secretary, actions in Venezuela. But we’ll start with this week’s news: the Trump administration saying that using the military to take Greenland is an option.

Senator Mark Kelly: It  would probably be the biggest mistake any president has made in the history of this country.

For us to threaten them, especially with force, that we’re just gonna take your stuff; we’re gonna take your territory—is that who we’ve become? That’s Russia. We are not that kind of a nation.

Rosin: Kelly had his own personal run-in with the U.S. military this week—or at least with Hegseth. It concerned a video that Kelly made, along with five other Democratic lawmakers who had also served in the military or the intelligence community.

They released it a couple of months ago, and its intended audience was people who are currently serving.

Kelly (from the lawmakers’ video): (Music plays.) This administration is pitting our uniformed military—

Senator Elissa Slotkin: —and intelligence-community professionals—

Representative Chris Deluzio: —against American citizens.

Rosin: The video came out two months into the U.S. military’s strikes on alleged drug boats, strikes that many have called illegal.

In the video, Kelly and others say that “threats to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad, but from right here at home.”

Kelly: Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders.

Rosin: Well, someone did not like the sound of that.

News anchor: Now, that is the statement right there from the president. It says, in part, “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.”

Rosin: On Truth Social, Trump kept posting and wrote, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”

Kelly (from press conference): President Trump is trying to silence me, threatening to kill me for saying what is true. And he sent his secretary of defense after me.

Rosin: This week, Hegseth sent the details of the intended punishment. He announced that his department had initiated proceedings to reduce Kelly’s retirement grade, which could mean a reduction in rank and pension pay. Echoing Trump, Hegseth called Kelly’s remarks “seditious.”

So I started my interview with Kelly by talking about that.

Rosin (in interview): There are people who can look at what the administration has done and say, What’s the big deal? A senator made this video, the president didn’t like it, and they’re docking his pension pay. So why is it a big deal? What’s unusual about this action?

Kelly: Well, first of all, he said I should be hanged, executed. If you’re looking for evidence why we needed to put out that video, that’s one valid point: We have a president who is rather unhinged and doesn’t like people speaking out in a way that he does not agree.

And in this case, we were just reminding service members of what is lawful, telling them that they should not follow illegal orders. It’s something we’re all trained on. We may not be reminded of it frequently.

And we had some serious concerns about what this president might do. In 2016, he called for the U.S. military—as a candidate—he said the U.S. military should be killing the family members of terrorists. That means killing women and children who are not involved. How horrific is that? And then started talking about shooting U.S. citizens who were protesters in the legs, sending troops into U.S. cities, and using those cities for training for the U.S. military.

These are things that are dangerous. So we put this video out as a friendly reminder that you do not follow illegal orders. When the law and orders are in conflict, you stick with the law; it’s a pretty simple message.

So getting to the point about demoting me, taking away part of my pension, I guess what they realize is they would not do well in front of a jury—because for a while there, they were threatening to court-martial me. They figured out that wasn’t a good option because they probably knew they would lose. So this is an administrative option.

But I’m gonna fight this with everything I have because it’s wrong. And,by the way, it sends a powerful and chilling message to retired service members, to ex-military, to people on active duty that you cannot say anything about this government.

Rosin: Or what? So that’s why the average American should care?

Kelly: Absolutely. We all have First Amendment constitutional rights of not only freedom of speech, but freedom to speak out against the U.S. government and to its leadership. And they don’t like that.

They’re trying to send a message—this isn’t just about me anymore. This is a message to the American people: Shut up, or there are consequences. And we cannot let that stand. So I’ll fight this with everything I have.

Rosin: Now, you and your colleagues published that video back in November. The secretary announced this reprisal against you two days after the U.S. bombed Venezuela, captured [Nicolás] Maduro. Do you think there’s any message in the timing of that?

Kelly: Well, here’s something interesting on timing, right—this wasn’t just about the video. If you read their censure letter to me, they go all the way back to June and said there were things that I said that they didn’t like.

They are pointing to my criticism of them for firing admirals and generals, and here’s why I was critical: They fired people that I confirmed, and they fired them because of the color of their skin or because they were women. That’s pretty clear to people, and I criticized Pete Hegseth and the administration over that. They point to that as a reason why I am now censured and I should be demoted—because I said something.

They also pointed to the fact that I said I will always stand up for the Constitution, as if that’s an objectionable thing for them. So, yeah, this is not just about me anymore. This is about all of our rights under the Constitution.

Rosin: So you’re a senator, and you have some power. I wanna put you in the mind of, say, when you were a younger person in the military. If you were young and in the military now, would you have refused any of the administration’s orders?

Kelly: Well, it depends on what the order was, right? I flew 39 combat missions in the first Gulf War. I was almost shot down multiple times, had a missile blow up next to my airplane.

On two occasions, I was ordered to sink ships, and I knew at the time that that was the right thing to do. It was legal for me to go into Kuwait harbor and sink this Osa II missile patrol boat, or in the case of the second one, this Polnocny troop carrier that was Iraqi—they were both Iraqi ships; it was very clear. I had no question about that.

If, under different circumstances, I was given an order to do something that any reasonable person would understand as illegal, yeah, I would’ve said, I’m not gonna do that. That’s what we’re all trained to do.

Rosin: So what about what actually happened, which is the second shot against the Venezuelan boat that killed the two sailors? Is it clear that was an illegal order? Is that an order—

Kelly: So I saw that video. I’ve been in a brief in a classified setting on the details of that second strike on that first boat, and I still have a lot of questions.

It would be a positive thing for the American people to see that video and to get briefed on it by the United States military, because transparency of what our Department of Defense is doing is—I think it’s something that is fundamental to the way we do things. Aren’t we supposed to be the good guys here?

I continue to have questions about that decision to strike that boat a second time. When you look at the rules of warfare—one of the examples that is cited in the manual of war, the law of Armed conflict, is that, for shipwrecked crew members, that you have an obligation to rescue them. And in this circumstance, that did not happen.

Now, DOD gives their rationale for why they did not do that. And it is questionable at best.

Rosin: And do you know what, in the moment, you would’ve done, as a person who served for a long time? ’Cause it’s different in retrospect, looking at it.

Kelly: It’s always different, right? And for somebody who’s been in that environment, where the bullets are flying and the missile’s blowing up next to your airplane, it is dynamic; it is chaotic; you have to make decisions quickly.

What myself and my colleagues were talking about were those obvious things, where a reasonable person in those circumstances would know that what you are asking to be done is unlawful—not the stuff that’s, like, on the line.

Rosin: —that you would count as clearly unlawful, of the many things that have happened over these last few months?

Kelly: I continue to have a lot of questions about how this Department of Defense, under the leadership of Pete Hegseth—and let me repeat something I’ve said multiple times: This guy is not qualified for this job. I did not vote for him.

We had to have the vice president come over to break a tie to get him across the finish line—by the way, after a lot of arm-twisting, I think that’s very fair to say, by the White House of my Republican colleagues who were hesitant, very hesitant, for good reasons.

He shouldn’t be anywhere near the front office of the Pentagon. I even question whether he should be in the building.

Rosin: You know what? I’ve heard you say he’s unqualified a lot of times. Can I ask you something I’m really curious about? What is—

Kelly: Yeah.  Rosin: Say you and your Navy people were talking about him. How would you talk about him—internally, privately? How would people describe someone like that who are military guys? What would they say about him?

Kelly: Well, he is a guy who served in multiple Guard units. I thank him for his service to this country. He doesn’t have the experience to run an organization of this size. He doesn’t have management experience at a high level. He doesn’t have policy experience—creating policy.

It’s hard to find somebody that checks all the boxes to be secretary of Defense ’cause it’s, perhaps, after being president of the United States, the hardest job in the country. It’s hard to find somebody that checks every box.

The problem with Pete Hegseth—he doesn’t check any of the boxes, zero. I’m shocked that the president nominated him for this. Why would you put this guy in this job?

Rosin: When we come back, what happens if the U.S. were to take Greenland by force? That’s after the break.

Rosin: I wanna talk to you about how this administration is using the military. This week, the White House put out a statement that, in the range of options to acquire Greenland, utilizing the military is an option. How concerned are you about these threats to Greenland?

Kelly: Months ago, I was not concerned at all. I thought it was just typical bluster from Donald Trump, wanting to show people he’s a strong man, and he can do what he wants and take what he wants.

After seeing what happened in Venezuela and the latest comments not only by Donald Trump, but people in the administration, and now even some of my colleagues, talking about why Greenland should be under the control of the United States.

First of all, Denmark is a member of NATO and an ally of ours. If we have concerns about security in the Arctic, we currently have U.S. service members based in Greenland. One option for us would be to go to Denmark and say, Hey, we want to increase our posture on Greenland for security reasons, and negotiate some sort of a deal with them to make sure that our national-security needs are met—which, by the way, also helps Denmark and Greenland.

But for us to threaten them, especially with force, that we’re just gonna take your stuff; we’re gonna take your territory—is that who we’ve become? That’s Russia. We are not that kind of a nation. This doesn’t make any sense.

So to answer your question, yeah, right now, I’m really concerned—when you listen to Stephen Miller and what he has said about this issue. But now some of my Republican colleagues in the Senate start talking about how, Well, sure. Why not?

Well, I’ll tell you why not: We’re the United States of America. We follow the rules. We uphold a standard of morality and an ethical code, and we just don’t go around and take other territories from other countries, or threaten to do that.

So, yeah, right now, I am rather concerned about where this is heading.

Rosin: Can you play the scenario out? What if we do go through with this, in the same way that the administration went through with Venezuela? Then what is happening (a) to the military and (b) to our standing in the world?

Kelly: Well, you’re putting members of the military into an uncomfortable position, and we’ll get into constitutional issues about what power the president has.

Certainly, the president has the ability at any moment to take action to protect U.S. territory and U.S. citizens and U.S. assets. Does that extend to just seizing territory from an ally? I don’t think so. He should come to Congress if he wants to do that, and let’s have a vote. Let’s see how many of my Republican colleagues are gonna vote to allow the president of the United States to use military force against a NATO ally.

But I’ll tell you what it would mean if we did this: It would mean NATO—which, I think it’s fair to say, has been a driver of peace in the world since World War II—as an organization, that is done if the United States takes Greenland by force.

Well, this has huge consequences. And I doubt the president listens to The Atlantic podcast, but the message I would wanna send to him is: You are making a huge strategic mistake here that will reverberate in a negative way for the United States of America for decades if you try to take Greenland by force.

Kelly: Well, taking that kind of action is possibly the justification that the People’s Republic of China would need to go in there and say, Well, you took Greenland; we’re gonna take Taiwan. They make a claim that Taiwan’s part of the People’s Republic of China—that’s their claim—and they think that they need to bring it back into the fold. So if we go and use the military against Denmark in taking their territory of Greenland, I think that’s a justification that the Chinese would like to have.

And how about Russia, by the way—hhas already attacked Ukraine. What if they say, Well, Kazakhstan, that was part of the Soviet Union before. And, oh, they also have a lot of oil and mineral wealth. Why can’t we go and take Kazakhstan?

So you’re creating an environment that puts us, strategically, in a very, very uncomfortable position, and it will last for decades.

Rosin: It sounds like worldwide chaos you’re describing; it’s more than uncomfortable.

Kelly: It would probably be the biggest mistake any president has made in the history of this country, to do something like that.

Rosin: The executive actions you’re describing are unprecedented; the use of the military is dangerous—you’ve laid that out. And yet, very few people in Congress seem to be doing anything. What do you say to people who look at Congress and think they’ve given up; there’s no resistance?

Kelly: Well, I’ll say, Republicans in the United States Congress have given up and ceded all of their power to the White House, to the president, to the people around him, to Stephen Miller. They basically said, Here you go. We’re not gonna stop you from doing anything.

The levers of power we have here in the United States Congress are substantial, but they reside with the majority, not with the minority, and Democrats are currently in the minority. So we win back the House or the Senate in November of 2026, and when we swear in a new Congress about a year—I actually think it’s probably a year from today or a couple days ago—then we have the levers we would need to really put a check on the lawlessness of this president.

And it extends beyond the military. This guy is enriching himself and his family and his friends in a way we have never seen before, the corruption from Donald Trump and his family. In the last year, he has increased his wealth by—I don’t think it’s fair to say an order of magnitude, but he has—multiple times, through meme coins and stablecoins and deals with foreign nations and selling people a bunch of crap, like tennis shoes and gold watches.

This is something like we’ve never seen before—so when we win back the House and/or the Senate, we’ll have the levers we need to do something about it.

Rosin: I’m taking it you don’t have those gold Trump sneakers in your closet.

Kelly: Nor will I ever have anything with the name of Donald Trump on it.

Rosin: I’ll just ask you: Are you gonna run for president in 2028?

Rosin: You haven’t made a decision, okay. If you were gonna run for president, what would be a Democratic nominee’s positioning that you think would be effective pushback to everything we’ve just described, which is big?

Kelly: One thing here is that this guy is trying to distract from all the problems that the American people have, right? This is a big distraction—and problems that he has personally. When was the last time somebody talked about all the [Jeffrey] Epstein information that DOJ has and when that’s gonna be released, right? That’s gone away. He has successfully moved that to the back burner for, I don’t know, days or weeks.

But we need people in charge of this country that are gonna address the issues that the American people care about. That’s the cost of their rent and their mortgage and their groceries and health care—he’s destroyed health care for millions of Americans. My constituents, some of ’em who are paying hundreds of dollars now have to pay thousands of dollars to get health care off the exchange.

So we need leadership that are focused on the things that matter, and this president is causing these distractions that occupy a tremendous amount of his time and his effort and his staff, and he doesn’t seem to care about the other stuff.

Rosin: I know you said many times you’re not gonna let the administration distract you, stop you, but this week is the 15th anniversary of your wife Gabby Giffords’s shooting. Your family knows better than most that it can be devastating to put yourself out there, and this moment feels way more dangerous than 15 years—

Rosin: Yeah. So do you have real conversations about this?

Kelly: With Gabby? Sure. This is 15 years—we were just up in New York City the other day; we did Good Morning America. She’s here now, in Washington; we’ll be together for the 15th anniversary of when she was nearly assassinated and took a bullet into the left side of her head. Yeah, we realize that this is a dangerous business.

I used to fly the space shuttle, right? I thought I had the dangerous job—I flew in combat. It was my wife, Gabby, who nearly lost her life serving this country. But neither of us are quitters. We do not give up. Neither of us are gonna be intimidated.

Because of what Donald Trump has said about me and what Pete Hegseth continues to do in going after me, the threats against me, my life, have gone up significantly. You know who they’ve also gone up for is my wife, Gabby. She now gets death threats because of Donald Trump saying I should be hanged. This is somebody who went through hell.

Kelly: Of course, she’s gonna keep going. She’s not backing down. She doesn’t back down to anybody—

Rosin: Well, Senator Kelly, good luck to both of you, and thank you for talking with me today.

            <div id="article-text">The &quot;play experts&quot; fear it will &quot;curtail imagination&quot;.

I call it bullshit! That only goes to show their own lack of imagination.

Introducing lights and sounds to the bricks is positively a very nice way to expand imagination. Actually, when I was a child, I did frequently add batteries, tiny lamps and slot cars engines to my Lego creations.

While I agree that this is really no big deal, without reading the article, I can imagine there might be some concern that having everything built in would remove the exact thing you mentioned. If the lights and sounds were already there, would you have ever explored the process of adding them yourself? Strangely, I was just thinking about Lego the other day and was thinking back to when I was a kid and there were no kits. You got a box of bricks and that was it. If you wanted to build a spaceship, you had

If the lights and sounds were already there, would you have ever explored the process of adding them yourself?I still would argue that, yes, I would. Only this time I&#39;d do it using the sensors and special bricks provided. I think it&#39;s also worth noting that these add-ons Lego is creating are expensive and will come only with certain kits, mostly created for adult audiences.I think the kits have probably curtailed creativity in some capacity.Well, here goes my personal, completely anedoctal experience:The kits were created during my childhood (so I have some pre-kits ones). With the kits, I would usually open the box, build it according to instructions, play a bit and then completely dismantle it and store with all the other ones. Then I spent most of my days building new stuff with it. No hinder in creativity in there.Nowadays, I still have all my Legos, and two small godchildren (4 and 6 yo). They love it and eagerly ask to come visit and play with it every weekend. Last Christmas, I bought a new kit to each one of them. And what did they do as soon as we opened it? They completely dismissed the kits, mixed all the bricks and started to build every type of crazy stuff.This makes me think the experts may be somehow underestimating kids imagination.

Machine washing powder used to be sold in big cylinder-shaped cardboard container (20 to 25 kilos I think) about as high as my 5 years self. I had 3 of those containers, all filled to the brim with nondescript Lego bricks in different colors and sizes when I was a kid in the 70s. I recognize the sentiment about having to build anything and everything first before you could get creative in building whatever you thought up.

And I agree that creativity became more stifled in 80s Lego that used pre-shaped bricks

Sounds like a part of psychology that the F grade students would go into.

You forget when they famously released Lego Technic with electric motors and immediately and forever stopped making traditional bricks.... oh wait...

Why do people have to be like this? Lego&#39;s core product is brilliant and popular and not going anywhere. This is OBVIOUSLY not a replacement for that. Its an adjacent, compatible product line that some subset of people could get a lot out of. The creative potential once you get away from the branded kits is really high.

This feels like people that are mad about rising Lego costs latching onto a mostly unrelated new product as a vessel to express their frustration.On the one hand, I get the backlash from the simple perspective of, &quot;Everything tech seems to be turning to garbage, why are they adding garbage to Lego.&quot; But from a Lego fan perspective, I can&#39;t see it as a bad thing. They&#39;ve had electronics in various playsets for decades now, and it hasn&#39;t taken away from the core Lego experience of building and working with your own imagination.

With Windows 11 being such a resource suck, that keeps sucking more and more with every update, it&#39;s no surprise that gamers would be interested in OS built for gaming.

Even as SteamOS slowly spreads across the AMD-powered hardware landscape, the OS continues to be limited by a lack of compatibility with the wide world of Arm devices.Name the ARM-based system that&#39;s relevant in PC gaming, justifying this statement. Oh, there isn&#39;t one? Oh, AMD&#39;s APUs are just as power efficient as an ARM when you take the GPU into account? Oh, the Steam Deck is amd64 based but still has good battery life? Oh.I&#39;m not an ARM hater, but the idea that lack of ARM compatibility has been affecting Valve is ridiculous.

Democrats have as much corporate tools as the Republicans do, is my impression. Perhaps slightly less obnoxious in pursuit of their goals, but that is about the only difference.

Both parties want to suck all the profit out of everything.

The most cynical view is that they are intentionally working together in an orchestrated fashion.

Republicans want to profit from starving children, Democrats want to profit from feeding themRepublicans want to profit from depriving people of health care, Democrats want to profit from helping them have itRepublicans want to profit from wars for oil, Democrats want to profit from renewable energyRepublicans want to profit

A problem many developers for Linux have is what distros to target and test for. Steam OS has the potential to be _the_ reference platform for porting games to Linux. Then, once something runs under SteamOS, other distros can work out what they need to do in order for those same games to work on their distro, assuming they&#39;re interested in games.

Until you talk to the driver who melted their headlight lens clean off by boosting them with Temu-grade laser light turbos putting out 376 million candlepower (gotta love how we still count candles) in order to drive safely at high noon.

CAFE if we get rid it of which we should its kinda crap will only lead to profit taking by the 3. They are doing some supid shit to get to the insane CAFE limits.I think thought the lights are insane as our cop lights those are just really about recking your vision.

I think thought the lights are insane as our cop lights those are just really about recking your vision.Right now the only thing those 3 are on top of, is a massive pile of unsold inventory.  We’re still tracking unsold 2024 models on lots.  They aren’t profiting worth a shit by not selling jack shit at MSRP+FU pricing.  Not to mention massive recalls due to unreliable designs pushed by CAFE extremes.Manufacturing costs come down when CAFE is reduced.  They actually might start making reliable cars again instead of insisting a Corolla needs 16-weight oil-water in the US.

Not even remotely true if we succeed in reducing the CAFE standards that have fucked consumer choice and automotive reliability for decades now.All of the automakers were ready, willing, and able to meet the emissions regulations well ahead of schedule, and the average vehicle is not made unreliable by the emissions systems. In fact, it is more efficient and gets better mileage because the best way to meet the targets is with more complete combustion.The only exception, and I mean this, is DPF for diesels. This is a garbage technology which should never have been employed. Even DEF is a positive thing (it virtually eliminates NOx in diesel exhaust) though the systems are generally shit. But that&#39;s not the DEF&#39;s fault, it&#39;s the automakers&#39; fault. DPF means finer soot and more CO2 emissions in exchange for burning up the large soot particles so the diesels don&#39;t look like they are polluting.

In fact, it is more efficient and gets better mileage because the best way to meet the targets is with more complete combustion.

The only exception, and I mean this, is DPF for diesels. This is a garbage technology which should never have been employed. Even DEF is a positive thing (it virtually eliminates NOx in diesel exhaust) though the systems are generally shit. But that&#39;s not the DEF&#39;s fault, it&#39;s the automakers&#39; fault. DPF means finer soot and more CO2 emissions in exchange for burning up the large soot particles so the diesels don&#39;t look like they are polluting.

We are NOT going to get any new even marginally consumer-friendly regulations during the next three years.You might, but it will be despite your government rather than because of it. 

If other countries (EU, UK, JP, AU) et al. introduce regulations than global manufacturers will bring those to the US by default as it doesn&#39;t make economic sense to make modifications to a global platform for a single country. The same way many American cars are now European Emissions Standards (EURO 1-7) compliant for their model year. Simply didn&#39;t make sense to use a different engine for a single market.

Headlights are way too bright and now with idiotic daytime running lights (useful in the artic circle, not so much in the med in the summer) it makes it MUCh harder to see oncoming motorbikes who used to stand out with their headlights on. Being narrow they&#39;re hard to see at the best of times but frankly, if a driver can&#39;t see an oncoming car or truck in bright daylight without headlights perhaps they need an eye test.

I&#39;m in my 50&#39;s, clean driving record.  Had to go to the BMV a few weeks ago to renew my license.  They made me take an eye test.  Explain to me again how we don&#39;t need eye tests for a license.

So if DRLs decrease crashes by 10% in semi-gloom arctic regions but increase them by 5% in regions with more daylight, it&#39;s still a win even if it makes things worse for most of the US population.Nope. The fraction of the US that is in semi-arctic regions is so low that it won&#39;t affect the average.

&quot;DRLs aren&#39;t the &quot;bright headlights&quot; this article is talking about.&quot;

Learn to read, I didn&#39;t say they were. They&#39;re 2 related issues. As for DLRs reducing accidents, there have been no studies with and without in the same conditions , just &quot;oh, accidents have dropped since they were introduced, it must have been the DLRs&quot;. Sorry, that isn&#39;t science.

As for DLRs reducing accidents, there have been no studies with and without in the same conditions Dude, that&#39;s literally what the statistics are about: the difference in rate of collisions between vehicles with and without DRL. On top of that, there are plenty of studies about human vision that support this outcome.I do not believe your argument is founded in reason but rather emotion/belief.

Cars that have DLR also have a lot of other safety features added too compared to older cars. It wasn&#39;t as if DLR was suddenly added And Nothing Else to a generation of vehicles.

False. Europe&#39;s regulations have a different problem. The regulations cover specifically that the bright beam can&#39;t shine into people&#39;s eyes, even reflectively, but fucks up how to achieve this. Mainly that the headlights are limited by beam angle. That is perfectly fine when everyone drives a hatchback, but not so fine when you drive a hatchback and the person behind you drives an SUV.  The beam angle then allows their lights to shine in your mirror.

In Europe it&#39;s not brightness that needs restriction, it&#39;

&quot;Also I&#39;ve never once ever been blinded by a daytime running light. Not sure what you&#39;re on about there.&quot;

Never said they were bright, but they&#39;re related issues.

In what way do they cause problems, in your view? I’m asking an open question, I’m genuinely curious. I’ve not personally found them problematic, but YMMV.

Read my original post - they make it much harder to distinguish motorbikes in busy traffic.

I did read your original post, but I don’t understand *how* DRLs make it harder to see a motorbike? Do you mean that if a motorbike is driving towards you in the opposite direction, and there’s a car behind it, it’s somehow more difficult to see the motorbike because of the DRLs? Or something else? I don’t doubt that you find there’s a problem, I just don’t yet understand what causes it to occur.

Is this a Europe only thing? At least in the US DLR are mostly useful for the people who will not turn on their headlights till they need to see as dusk occurs. Un-disablable auto low beams would do the same thing. IDK why there are so many people who insist on driving almost in the dark with their lights off, but there are a noticeable amount. They also help (and auto lights would help) with people driving in cities with overhead lights and apparently again not realizing their lights are off when they driv

IDK why there are so many people who insist on driving almost in the dark with their lights offPeople who started their trip when the sun was high and end up continuing in the dark without headlights on do so because they&#39;re absent minded - it&#39;s an example of the &quot;boiling a frog&quot; phenomenon. Most of the instances I see occur in the evening rather than the early morning before dawn.

Oh I see what you mean now, misready your post.

But the reality is DRLs improved safety. This is something that you yourself acknowledge since you complain now that motorbikes no longer stand out.

Height. As in pickup trucks and their cousins, full sized SUVs, and the upper headlights being nearly exactly at the height of the eyes of drivers in smaller coupes and sedans.

And lifted trucks, with headlights aimed directly into the rear windows of those smaller vehicles. As they must be, after all, being higher they need to be pointed down more profoundly to actually illuminate roadway in a useful fashion.

When do we get some regulation preventing this direct illumination of other drivers, to their distra

DRL are fine. The issue is badly adjusted super bright headlights. Most people don&#39;t know that there is a switch to angle them appropriately, and the auto ones react too slowly.

It&#39;s well past time that larger cars were re-classified as a different class of vehicle. (VLGV for the UK). That way it&#39;d be easy for them to pay extra tax, higher penalties for driving infractions, bans for the really bad one, so on and

Daytime running lights help in the early evening when the sky is darkening but people have not yet turned on their headlights because they aren&#39;t legally required to do so until sunset.

Be we really need clarity about headlight colors (too blue destroys night vision) and that annoying flicker that you can see in your peripheral vision.

Then make them come on below a certain light threshold - which a lot of cars do anyway now with their main headlights. They don&#39;t need to be on midday in summer.

DRL can be implemented in two different ways. Long story short, when they do it with the headlights it&#39;s good, when they don&#39;t it&#39;s bad.

Headlights aren&#39;t too bright, they&#39;re too point-sourced. Specifically, some LED lights (without a diffuser) and all projector lights have bright spots which are the real problem, not the overall brightness.

I put Beamtech LED capsules in my Versa. It has old cloudy headlights so there&#39;s no bright points, but there wouldn&#39;t be anyway because they are a classic reflector desig

This has nothing to do with Cheeto. It has been going on for years. It is the culmination of multiple problems. 
One of the biggest culprits is headlamp focusing. If Both vehicles are at the same level, no problem. If one is slightly lowe, they&#39;ll be in the area of focus. I&#39;ve occasionally given someone the high beams, they return the favor, but their high beams then shoot over my head, at least u

The total light emission isn&#39;t the most significant factor regarding what makes headlights glaring. It&#39;s the size/area of the light source. When the Sun is behind a cloud, you can look at it directly .. and yet the surroundings/day isn&#39;t really any darker. Why? Because the brightness is spread out and no longer a point-source. If a car&#39;s entire front bumper was a diffusion sheet .. a car could emit a large amount of light and still not blind anyone.

Angle matters. It doesn&#39;t matter if your headlight is a high powered laser, it only blinds the people if its pointed at them. The problem is universally where the lights are pointed. For most cars of the same size that doesn&#39;t matter. The problem is when you have a hatchback followed by an American abomination of an idiotic monstertruck (more colloquially known as an SUV, or a small penis compensation machine), the headlights are mounted too high in the first place and as such aren&#39;t angled down far enough

Next, states should begin requiring headlight alignment inspection during vehicle inspections.You don&#39;t have this already???

The US is quite like the EU in this regard: each state has its own independent driver and vehicle licensing authority, so they all do it differently, subject to some over arching rules.

With that said, un the US the over arching rules are very weak.

In NM, for example there&#39;s the annual inspection to make sure the emergency spare is installed on one of your wheels rather than stashed uselessly in the trunk, that the treads aren&#39;t too deep and to make sure your windscreen is adequ

No. In the USA even the very strictest inspection regimes are basically &quot;is anything falling off&quot; and they don&#39;t do real stuff like test your headlight aim or brake fluid boiling point. MOST people don&#39;t have any inspection requirements except emissions testing, and some states don&#39;t even do that.

Here in California for example we have no safety testing, and a number of remote counties don&#39;t have to do regular emissions testing — only on transfer to a non-family-member, except for heavy diesel RVs whic

I really never thought NY would have worse inspections than CA, but yea - we have emissions testing, all sorts of physical inspections - you can fail on torn wiper blades. In fact, I think it&#39;s a bit of a scam of the inspection garages to force you to buy cheap wiper blades at jacked up prices to pass you. Oh, and no CEL for any reason I think.

The emissions testing is the worst though - we&#39;re way out in a rural area, and I think the number of cars junked cause fixing emissions (otherwise run fine) may well

It&#39;s possible that more glare causes less fatalaties than more glare prevents (not exactly the IIHS argument, but what it would be if they were honest). But shouldn&#39;t some weight be given to comfort?

In EU we have the same problem. Those LEDs are blinding anyone on a dark road.And unlike HID (Xenon), they don&#39;t need to have leveling and washers.

False. LEDs are blinding anyone any more than any other light that is misaligned. And they don&#39;t have levelling washers are they are factory levelled. Aftermarket retrofits absolutely have levelling washers which were required back in the day where the angle of light was dependent on the bulb you inserted into the fitting (where the filament glow starts compared to the reflector).

The problem we have in the EU is the laws are based on angle of light and don&#39;t take into account idiots driving American sized a

It&#39;s funny how driving habits vary per region vis a vis bright headlights.  Up in the Northeast, when I drive my vehicle the oncoming traffic often flashes their high-beams thinking my high-beams are on and/or my lamps are misaligned (they are not).Here in the Mid Atlantic, nobody does anything.

My Toyota RAV4 and Jeep Wrangler both use &quot;projector&quot; single bulb incandescent headlights. Subjectively, they are far dimmer than the old sealed beam reflector units we used to drive with.How did the US go from headlights you could drive with to headlights you can&#39;t see with, to LED headlights that blind you even on &quot;low beam&quot;?

children shouldn&#39;t be allowed to drive monster trucks

&quot;LEDs can be made to focus light using lasers&quot;

What on earth are they talking about? Is this nonsense like I suspect, or does anyone know something about this?

&quot;Manufacturers want as much light as possible in order to get a high score for the IIHS headlight safety ratings. &quot;

At least be honest.  The problem is people wanting super bright lights while concurrently not wanting to be blinded by other peoples super bright lights.  You can usually sort out who has obnoxious lights and who doesn&#39;t just by color temperature alone.

All of this nonsense about misalignment or the need for fancy technology to steer light everywhere but other drivers eyeballs ignores the plain

The shame of having bad data would have made them lose face, which is very very bad in Japanese culture. Fabricating facts and manipulation of data is just a normal part of the culture unfortunately.

One interesting thing is that one of the reasons Japan has such a low official violence and murder rate is that the police will categorize dead bodies discoveries as &quot;abandoned body&quot; rather than declaring a homicide. If they do solve the murder case, then, and only then, will the

That is nonsense. For example, there is currently a big case where a woman was murdered in her apartment getting a lot of attention. Not found or abandoned, murdered. Suspects unknown.

It&#39;s the same with their slow pace adopting EVs. Too invested in hybrid tech.

It takes two things: Minimal storage for one, which nobody seems to be seriously building... And two, a sturdy grid. Which nobody has, least of all the US.

After nine months of relative silence on the matter, President Donald Trump is once again making noise about taking over Greenland, by force if necessary.

Perhaps it’s the result of his sugar-high, brought on by last weekend’s military operation in Venezuela, a country that he now says he “runs” and whose potentially vast oil resources he claims to control.

In any case, U.S. allies worldwide are alarmed—some are even uncharacteristically objecting in public—by Trump’s unabashedly imperialist turn. Others, notably Russia and China, may be tempted by the implicit green light that he has signaled, intentionally or not, toward their own ambitions for regional domination of Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively.

Many are simply baffled by this obsession with territorial expansion. House Speaker Mike Johnson insists that Trump has no intention of launching a military invasion of Greenland. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio notes that Trump wants to buy Greenland, not conquer the place—though this provides little reassurance about the president’s mindset.

Yet this desire to take over Greenland seems to stem from an impulse even cruder than one might suspect. Susan Glasser and Peter Baker reported in their book, The Divider, about Trump’s first term as president, that the idea was inspired by his friend and supporter billionaire perfume heir Ronald Lauder, who one day pointed to a map alleging to show the appeal of acquiring Greenland.

Not long after, the president raised the idea at a National Security Council meeting. As Trump himself recounted to the authors:

I said, “Why don’t we have that?” You take a look at a map. I’m a real-estate developer. I look at a corner, I say, “I’ve got to get that store for the building that I’m building,” etc. It’s not that different. I love maps. And I always said, “Look at the size of this [Greenland]. It’s massive. That should be part of the United States.”

Actually, it’s not that massive. Flat Mercator-projection maps, like the one Lauder showed Trump, exaggerate the size of landmasses near the Earth’s north and south poles. Greenland, which looks larger than the United States on such maps, is in fact only slightly larger than Mexico, which Trump hasn’t coveted for its size, even though it’s right on our border, not 1,200 miles from our closest coastline.

Still, could that be it? Trump’s a real-estate magnate; he sees a big slab of land; he wants it? Seems so. In fact, back in 2019, when he first talked publicly about buying the land, he thought his right to do so was so self-evident that he was shocked when the prime minister of Denmark—which has long controlled Greenland as an autonomous territory—told him it wasn’t for sale; he even canceled an upcoming visit to Copenhagen over her “nasty” rejection.

Other rationales for grabbing the island nation have since entered the picture, perhaps after briefings by aides who know that part of their job involves feeding the boss’ appetite, however bizarre. Though it’s largely uninhabited—with just 56,000 residents, most of them Inuits—Greenland does hold massive, though ice-covered, mineral deposits. And it has geostrategic value. During the Cold War, admirals talked about the “GIUK Gap,” the initials standing for Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. U.S. air and naval policy in those days was to keep Soviet ships and submarines holed up north of the Gap, so they don’t pose much of a threat; let them into the Gap, and they could threaten the Atlantic’s vital sea lanes. The same is true today, as the melting of Arctic ice allows Russian and Chinese vessels new routes into the lanes.

But so what? The U.S. can defend those lanes without annexing Greenland. It and Denmark are both members of NATO. The United States has an enormous air and missile-defense base in Greenland. It has also signed deals for vast access to bases in Denmark, and Danish leaders have offered to expand the terms and the size of U.S. troop deployments. There are also many other bases nearby, manned and operated by U.S. and various European defense forces.

This is one reason a country has allies and foreign bases—so it can defend its interests without having to invade or buy up half the world.

Of course, Trump’s renewed rumblings about Greenland—which seem less fantastical since his openly imperial operation in Venezuela—are disrupting those alliances. Some close U.S. allies voted to condemn the Caracas raid at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council. Others—including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has taken great pains to avoid confrontations with the sensitive American president—warned Trump very sternly not to make serious moves on Greenland. Denmark’s prime minister said that such a move—one NATO country threatening the sovereignty of another—would destroy the alliance and crater the foundations of peace in Europe since World War II.

Commentators in South Korea and Japan who are closely aligned with their governments’ political positions have noted that Trump’s latest words and deeds provide growing evidence—even more so than earlier words and deeds—that the largest democracies in Asia can no longer rely on the U.S. for protection. The resulting dangers are considerable—the possibility of nuclear proliferation and new arms races (as allies, who have relied on America’s “nuclear umbrella” for their ultimate defense, conclude they need to erect their own) or even armed conflict (as, for instance, China or North Korea see the need to pounce while the U.S. veers away).

Back during Trump’s eruptions of bombast over Greenland in his first term, H.R. McMaster, who had recently stepped down (or been fired) as his national security adviser, waved away concerns, saying, “This is just President Trump being President Trump.”

Now, not quite a year into his much more volcanic and disruptive second term, McMaster’s wave-off reads as something other than reassurance today. Yes, this is President Trump. The world is very worried, and we should be too.

Shortly after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, city leaders began looking into whether the officer had violated state criminal law.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and to make sure that there is an investigation that is conducted in full.” Police Chief Brian O’Hara followed up by saying that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is “investigat[ing] whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.”

If they conclude that state law has been violated, the question is: What next? Contrary to recent assertions from some federal officials, states can prosecute federal officers for violating state criminal laws, and there is precedent for that.

Although federal officers do have immunity in some circumstances, that protection applies only if their actions were authorized under federal law and “necessary and proper” in fulfilling federal duties. When federal officers violate federal law or act unreasonably when carrying out their duties, they can face state charges.

States have a long history of prosecuting federal officials for allegedly using excessive force on the job. And when federal courts agree that the force may not have been legally justified, they have allowed the state prosecution to proceed.

In a high-profile incident from the 1990s, for example, an FBI sniper shot and accidentally killed an unarmed woman while carrying out a siege of a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to pursue charges, but a county prosecutor in the state did, charging the sniper with involuntary manslaughter. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the state prosecution to proceed, concluding that there were “material questions of fact” about whether the sniper’s use of deadly force was reasonable. If it wasn’t, the court explained, he would not be immune from state prosecution. (The charges were later dropped after the prosecutor who brought the case left office.)

Similarly, in 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state prosecution to go ahead against two federal soldiers who had shot and killed a man they believed was stealing from federal property. As with the Idaho case, key facts were in dispute. The court concluded that if the man had stopped and surrendered, as multiple witnesses attested, “it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law,” and the soldiers could be held liable.

There are also a host of cases from the early-1900s prohibition era in which states charged federal officers with murder, attempted murder, or other crimes when they used lethal force to carry out prohibition-related arrests or seize distillery equipment. Again, when federal courts concluded that the federal officers’ use of force appeared unreasonable—such as by shooting into cars that officers believed were transporting alcohol—the courts allowed the state prosecutions to proceed.

To be sure, there are also plenty of cases in which federal courts have instead dismissed state prosecutions on the grounds that the federal officers were properly discharging their federal duties. For example, the foundational Supreme Court case on this type of immunity dismissed a state murder prosecution of a U.S. marshal who had justifiably killed an attacker while protecting a Supreme Court justice. But when an officer’s actions are not authorized by federal law or are not “necessary and proper” to fulfill federal duties—such as when an officer uses unreasonable force—state prosecutions can and do go ahead.

If state or local prosecutors in Minnesota were to charge a federal officer with a state crime, that case would play out differently from a typical state criminal prosecution.

Most significantly, it would likely take place in federal court rather than state court. A federal statute allows federal officers to move state criminal cases from state to federal court if they have a defense rooted in federal law. Any federal officer charged with a state-law crime for actions committed on the job will almost certainly try to claim federal immunity from state prosecution. That defense will typically suffice to get the case into federal court, even if the immunity claim ultimately fails.

But the move to federal court doesn’t mean that federal players would take over the entire process. The state or local prosecutor would still prosecute the case in federal court. And the criminal charges would still be for state-law crimes. Importantly, this means that if an officer were convicted, the president could not pardon them. The president can pardon individuals only for federal crimes, not state crimes.

Additionally, if state or local prosecutors do bring charges, the pretrial litigation over immunity could well be lengthy. In the Idaho case discussed above, for example, the incidents took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the 9th Circuit ultimately ruled that the case could go ahead. The various lower-court proceedings and appeals took considerable time.

Despite these procedural complexities, the bottom line is that federal officers are not categorically immune from state prosecution for actions carried out while on duty. And states have long demonstrated that they are willing to bring such charges when it comes to excessive use of force.

When George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, the nation’s immediate reaction was one of horror. That included Republican commentators, who expressed their shock at the slow murder of Floyd by suffocation, agreeing his treatment was both brutal and excessive. President Donald Trump called Floyd’s killing “sickening” and “revolting.” There were stray voices who immediately blamed Floyd for his own murder—a preview of the position the MAGA commentariat would eventually adopt—but at least in the beginning, Republicans in power reacted to a heinous murder caught on camera with disapproval.

Five and a half years later, we live in a very different world.

On Wednesday, videos circulated on social media of another killing in Minneapolis, of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer repeatedly shooting a woman in her car. We don’t know many details yet about the woman, but we do know she was killed. It’s a horrible loss of life.

To the president, though, weighing in a few hours later, it was “horrible” for another reason. “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he wrote on Truth Social. “The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”

The video reveals this account to be a lie. The woman—identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good—did not run over an ICE agent, and the car was turning away from the agents when one fired multiple shots into the vehicle.

Nevertheless, the MAGA commentary machine made it clear that the video wouldn’t disrupt their narrative around ICE and deportations. The party line quickly emerged: The victim was a threat whose killing was justified. And beyond that, the commentators identified the people truly at fault for the killing: Democrats who criticized ICE agents.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared the woman had been committing “domestic terror.” Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator, argued on Fox that “We would not be dealing with this kind of confrontation if these leaders would encourage these far-left activists to be peaceful.” On social media, she was more insistent: “ALL of this could be avoided if Democrat leaders would STOP encouraging and emboldening THUGS who attack and antagonize our law enforcement agents and officers!”

The powerful X account Libs of TikTok responded to a video of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz objecting to the shooting by arguing the woman had been trying to kill the officers. “This comes after you and your friends demonized ICE for months on end and incited violence against them,” the account wrote. “Hope this helps.”

“The Democrat party’s violent rhetoric against ICE agents now has their brainwashed followers trying to murder them with their cars,” another popular X account wrote.

“The Left and ONLY THE LEFT is 100% responsible for creating the conditions for this event,” wrote William Wolfe, a Southern Baptist leader who once worked in the Trump administration. “They spent the last 10 years telling their foot soldiers they are some merry band of morally superior resistance fighters.”

The official Trump administration position, too, was one with the influencers’. “[O]ne of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” an official DHS statement read. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

There was, in that reaction, no talk of investigation or urging of calm until facts could be determined. There was only right-wing influencer spin, converting the killing of an American into another point of political attack. “This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats,” the statement read.

To be clear, the incident, shown from a couple different angles, does not show murderous intent from the driver. The woman was parked in her SUV when two ICE agents got out of a pickup truck and walked over to her. One walked briskly, the other at a slow pace. The brisk-walking officer then tried to reach for the handle of the driver-side door. As he did so, the woman reversed a few feet, in an apparent attempt to resituate the car in order to drive away. When she braked, a third agent became visible standing in front of the car. She then shifted from reverse to drive and pulled forward at an angle, in an attempt to drive away from the officers. An officer pulled out his gun, sidestepped the car, and—as she was already pulling away—shot repeatedly toward the windshield or driver’s side window. The officer then calmly put his gun back in his holster and walked toward the car, which had crashed into another car down the street. It’s possible there was more to the incident than the videos show, but it seems very unlikely, based on the angle we’ve seen, that the officer was in any real danger.

It’s a shocking video, made all the more shocking by its circumstances: The woman, according to local news reports from the scene, was not a suspect leaving a crime or even an immigrant afraid of arrest, but a political protester trying to protect her neighbors. Federal agents were operating in Minneapolis as part of a major deportation campaign targeting its Somali community. The city’s government had not asked for the agents’ involvement and instead actively protested their presence.

We can’t be sure this will be the final evolution in the MAGA response to the incident. Others have hinted that they see this not just as a way to blame Democrats for their rhetoric, but to actually justify further violations of civil liberties and an expansion of the police state.

“National Guard needs to be deployed to Minneapolis,” the commentator Tim Pool argued. “This cannot be allowed to stand.”

“Leftists are reliably shocked when you don’t let them murder you,” one writer for the Blaze wrote. “But they are weak, you should not fear them, just crush them.”

“Many conservatives are calling on President Trump to SURGE THE MILITARY into Minneapolis after the traitorous mayor doubles down in favor of the anti-ICE terrorist,” another major account wrote.

Five years ago, the shocking murder of George Floyd was met with horror and deep, nonpartisan sadness, at least for a period. Today’s MAGA operation, though, is already at work rehabilitating his killer.

What happened on Wednesday morning in Minneapolis? If you believe Department of Homeland Security public affairs official Tricia McLaughlin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers found themselves in mortal danger when “violent protesters” interrupted their “targeted operations.” As she put it, “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.” The officer responded by shooting the driver in the head, or, as McLaughlin put it, “He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

The driver, reportedly a 37-year-old American woman, was killed.

We do not have to take Tricia McLaughlin’s word for it, though. We don’t even have to rely on eye witnesses or normal journalism to understand what happened this morning in Minneapolis. There is a video of it that anyone can watch, which pretty clearly shows what happened.

As Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey put it in a press briefing: “What I can tell you is the narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative. That is not true. It has no truth. And it needs to be stated very clearly, since we have already seen a video of it.”

Frey described the shooting as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.” But you don’t have to believe Frey either: because there is a video that you can watch for yourself.

Should you watch it? It was another infamous video that came out of Minneapolis that prompted one of the broadest recent discussions of whether we all need to watch incredibly graphic accounting of brutality government entities (in that case, the police; in this case, ICE) perpetrate against ordinary people. It’s disturbing to have to watch these things, to be the eyes of accountability, to witness any other human’s last unwilling moments on Earth, and it is particularly disturbing when you are a member of a persecuted group. But millions watched the footage of George Floyd’s killing. That is probably one of the main reasons there was accountability for the police officer who murdered him.

I work in news, so I don’t really have a choice in watch-it-or-don’t matters. I am here to tell you: On this one, you can watch it. In fact, you should watch it.

For one thing, it is disturbing but not as graphic as the Floyd video (at least, not in a bloody, intimate sense). The sounds, more than the visuals, are the things that will haunt you here. It shows the officers coming at the car, it shows the car driving away and then careening into the side of the road as it crashes. I had to watch a couple of times to understand when the shot happened and who took the shot. There is plenty of horrified screaming in the background, which is the stuff of nightmares, but you can get the idea by watching it on silent (if that is the kind of thing that will help you stomach it).

But it is also extremely clarifying in terms of specifically how inaccurate the DHS statement is. Sure, yes, this video captures under a minute in time. Perhaps later there will be facts that come out that add more credence to the understanding that this person was a threat—maybe. The entire idea of what happens next is headache-inducing; given the federal government’s initial posture—and the position of President Donald Trump more generally toward using the Department of Justice as his own plaything—it is already laughable to expect a fair probe of the incident from the federal government. The public should pressure local authorities to conduct such an investigation. Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O’Hara assured reporters that the FBI was working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in the investigation, “and the purpose of their involvement would be to investigate whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.” There would be many obstacles to justice if it is determined that a crime was committed here by state and local officials—though O’Hara already repeatedly referred to the place of the shooting as a “crime scene”—but we at least need that effort at justice.

To a much larger extent, I think what the 47 seconds the video does show makes it pretty clear. This was not a “must shoot to kill” moment.

Despite this clarity, narratives immediately spun out. The New York Times’ live blog on the situation, for example, made it seem like reality could only be ascertained by triangulating the narratives of the various involved authorities at play here: DHS on one hand and statements from the city’s mayor on the other. But you don’t need to triangulate between these supposedly official accounts. You can just watch the video.

And there is another reason you should watch the video. We currently live in a true upside-down universe, a universe in which you cannot trust your government to accurately characterize what is happening in the world. Sure, yes, that has been happening for a long time, since there were governments at all, never mind America’s. But we are living in a particularly noxious moment where the government we currently live under is willing to lie directly to our faces about what we can see with our own eyes. To wit,  Trump apparently watched the video too today, and as is his habit, he live-blogged his interpretation in a giant wall of text. After asserting that the woman who was killed was “obviously a professional agitator,” he claims that she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE officer” and that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”

But no one was run over by the car. The shooting officer, in the video, can be seen calmly walking away toward the woman he just shot and killed.

So: Your federal government is already sprinting away with its spin on what happened this morning, with a narrative that will attempt to justify the woman who died as a dangerous protester and will cast the ICE agents who faced her down as heroes. As a different government official, Frey, put it, “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bullshit.” Which government official should you believe? Well, in this case, you don’t have to decide. You can just believe your own eyes.

            <div id="article-text">NASA has postponed today&#39;s spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) due to an undisclosed &quot;medical concern&quot; with a crew member.

The US space agency has shared few details, other than the fact that the issue arose yesterday and resulted in today&#39;s spacewalk being delayed. The single crew member involved is in stable condition, according to a NASA spokesperson.

The spokesperson added: &quot;Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11&#39;s mission. These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely.&quot;

The SpaceX Crew-11 mission is the 11th SpaceX operational mission, and the crew consists of NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.

While there is no definitive end date for the Crew-11 mission, the SpaceX Crew-12 mission is due to launch no earlier than February 15, 2026.

Fincke, a Space Shuttle veteran, was initially set to fly on Boeing&#39;s CST-100 Starliner Crew Flight Test before being made the pilot of the first operational mission of the Calamity Capsule. He was then moved to the SpaceX Crew-11 mission, along with Yui. Cardman was to have been the commander of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission before being removed (along with fellow astronaut Stephanie Wilson) to make room for the returning Starliner astronauts, Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams.

Station commander Fincke and flight engineer Cardman were set to venture outside the orbiting laboratory for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to route cables for a future solar array, install jumper cables, snap photos of hardware, and collect microorganism samples.

Shortly before NASA&#39;s announcement, Cardman shared an image of Yui reflected in the visor of a helmet. Yui and NASA astronaut Chris Williams were to run the suit-up operations for today&#39;s postponed spacewalk.

While Yui, Williams, Cardman, and Fincke were preparing for the spacewalk, Roscosmos flight engineers Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Oleg Platonov were investigating the use of AI to transcribe audio files documenting crew activities, and Sergei Mikaev worked on uninstalling a camera that photographed landmarks during the crew&#39;s sleep shift.

Williams and Yui later worked on physics and microbiology research.

While the nature of the medical concern is private, NASA is expected to share a new date for the upcoming spacewalk in the near future. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/ransomware_2025_emsisoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If 2025 was meant to be the year ransomware started dying, nobody appears to have told the attackers.

In its 2025 State of Ransomware in the US report, security firm Emsisoft says ransomware attacks continued to climb last year, with more victims appearing on extortion sites and more groups operating than ever before. The figures climbed even as police and prosecutors notched up a string of wins against ransomware groups, such as the global takedown of BlackSuit in August.

Trackers keeping an eye on ransomware leak sites logged more than 8,000 claimed victims worldwide in 2025, a rise of more than 50 percent compared to 2023. The counts come from outfits watching dark web shaming pages such as Ransomware.live and RansomLook.io, so they only include cases where crooks decided to post receipts. Plenty of victims, Emsisoft says, will have paid up, recovered, or kept quiet without ever appearing on a leak site.

Emsisoft&#39;s numbers also suggest there are more gangs in the game than there were a couple of years ago, with the count of active ransomware crews climbing from a few dozen in 2023 to well into three figures by the end of 2025. Instead of a handful of mega-brands dominating, the scene now looks messier, with lots of smaller outfits popping up, disappearing, and reappearing under new names as affiliates drift between operations.

That could explain why all the splashy takedowns haven&#39;t translated into fewer ransomware attacks. While pulling the plug on a gang&#39;s infrastructure might kill one brand, it rarely kills the people behind it, who tend to resurface quickly under a new name or latch onto the next crew looking for experienced hands.

Even so, the same handful of ransomware brands kept turning up again and again on leak sites last year, with names like Qilin, Akira, Cl0p, and Play racking up large victim counts. Emsisoft warns against treating those tallies like a proper leaderboard, though, since some gangs are far louder than others when it comes to naming and shaming victims.

The report also points to a change in how many ransomware break-ins actually start. Bugs and exposed services still play a role, but gangs are leaning harder on old-fashioned tricks such as phishing, stolen logins, and social engineering to get a foot in the door, with crews that include Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters favoring approaches that go straight around perimeter defenses rather than through them.

Emsisoft threat intelligence analyst Luke Connolly says the churn, along with this change in tactics, is what keeps ransomware ticking over: affiliates move on, names disappear, and the same attacks keep happening under different banners.

&quot;As long as affiliates remain plentiful and social engineering remains effective, victim counts are likely to continue rising,&quot; he said. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/airlines_face_another_altimeter_upgrade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Airlines operating in the US may have to upgrade their aircraft radio altimeters again at a cost of billions of dollars, to avoid potential interference with cell networks following the Trump administration&#39;s decision last year to auction off additional spectrum to bidders.

On Wednesday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice of proposed new regulations. If implemented, these will require all radio altimeters to meet specific minimum performance requirements.

Those requirements are for altimeters to able to withstand interference from wireless signals in neighboring spectrum bands, while continuing to provide accurate altitude readings to both pilots and integrated aircraft safety systems.

And the cost for all this? The FAA estimates the total bill to retrofit aircraft with interference-tolerant altimeters will be $4.49 billion, or $424 million annualized at a 7 percent discount rate over 20 years.

According to the FAA, the blame for this move lies with the Trump administration and its US budget bill signed into law last year that directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to open up more radio frequencies to be auctioned off for commercial use.

This sell-off must include at least 100 MHz and possibly as much as 180 MHz of the 3.98 to 4.2 GHz band (Upper C-band), which the FCC intends to make available for terrestrial wireless flexible use, as disclosed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [PDF] last year.

However, aircraft radio altimeter (RA) systems operate in the adjacent 4.2 to 4.4-GHz band, and the FAA is clearly worried about the possibility of interference if cellular network operators start using the Upper C-band to deliver services.

&quot;FAA expects future wireless services in the Upper C-band aligned with service rules in the Lower C-band to cause interference to current RA systems. Existing RA systems are not compatible with this envisioned use, and airworthiness directives issued by FAA in 2023 are insufficient to address the unsafe condition that will result from wireless services in the Upper C-band,&quot; the agency says in its proposal document.

Wireless service providers have already taken voluntary measures in the proximity of airports, the FAA says, but these commitments will hit a sunset date at the start of 2028 unless extended by mutual agreement, and long-term compatibility between Lower C-band wireless services and RA systems has not been resolved beyond that date.

It believes that a single retrofit of RA systems will be able to address compatibility issues with wireless services in both the Lower and Upper C-band, and says the aviation industry has been working to develop standards for next-generation RA systems for several years now.

The deadline for making these changes is proposed to coincide with the FCC&#39;s date authorizing the initiation of new wireless services in the Upper C-band, which the FAA currently expects to be sometime between 2029 and 2032.

This isn&#39;t the first time this issue has arisen. Back in 2021, The Register reported that the FAA was concerned enough to consider restricting flights once 5G services were up and running. European aviation regulators declared that this wasn&#39;t an issue on their side of the Atlantic, however.

The solution from the FAA back then was also to replace the affected RA systems, and the agency set a deadline of February 1, 2024 for all updates to be carried out. It later declared that, as of the end of September 2023, the entire US airline fleet had upgraded their equipment and the risk of 5G interference had been mitigated.

Until last year, of course, when the newly installed Trump administration decided to start re-allocating spectrum in order to generate more revenue from license fees.

The FAA&#39;s notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) document is open for comments for 60 days, a period that ends on March 9.

We approached two bodies representing airlines for comment, Airlines for America (A4A) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and will update if we hear anything back. ®

            <h2>CISA flags actively exploited Office relic alongside fresh HPE flaw</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/cisa_oneview_powerpoint_bugs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CISA has added a pair of security holes to its actively exploited list, warning that attackers are now abusing a maximum-severity bug in HPE&#39;s OneView management software and a years-old flaw in Microsoft Office.

The latest update to CISA&#39;s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog flags CVE-2025-37164, a code injection vulnerability in HPE OneView, and CVE-2009-0556, a PowerPoint code injection bug that&#39;s been lurking for more than 15 years.

CVE-2025-37164 carries a perfect 10.0 CVSS score and affects HPE OneView, software used to manage servers, storage, and networking gear from a central console. In a December 18 advisory, HPE said the flaw could be exploited to inject and execute code, potentially granting full control of affected environments, though it did not say at the time whether attacks were already underway.

CISA&#39;s decision to add the flaw to its exploited-in-the-wild catalog suggests that has now changed, even if details remain thin. HPE did not respond to The Register&#39;s questions about whether attackers have been observed in customer environments, how many customers might be exposed, or if any data has been exfiltrated as a result of exploitation.

Security firms, however, previously warned that the bug was unlikely to remain theoretical for long. Following HPE&#39;s disclosure, a proof-of-concept exploit was published by Rapid7, which suggested defenders treat the issue as an assumed-breach scenario. eSentire noted that the availability of working exploit code significantly lowered the barrier for attackers to move from curiosity to compromise.

Alongside the OneView issue, CISA also flagged CVE-2009-0556, a Microsoft Office PowerPoint code injection vulnerability rated 8.8 on the CVSS scale. The bug, confirmed by Microsoft back in 2009, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via memory corruption when a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. Microsoft patched the issue years ago as part of MS09-017, but its appearance in the KEV catalog indicates that unpatched or unsupported systems are still being successfully targeted.

The two vulnerabilities have little in common. One is old enough to vote and should have been patched out of existence long ago, while the other is a fresh enterprise flaw buried in the machinery of modern datacenters. For attackers, age clearly isn&#39;t a deal-breaker if the exploit still works. ®

            <h2>AOSP on a diet plan as Google halves Android code drops</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/google_aosp_changes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has confirmed there will be two code dumps to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) per year, down from the four developers have become accustomed to.

The announcement was made on the Android Open Source Project&#39;s home page: &quot;Effective in 2026, to align with our trunk stable development model and ensure platform stability for the ecosystem, we will publish source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4.&quot;

The closed Android operating system has historically had a quarterly update cadence, which was followed by code drops for AOSP. Security updates will continue to be more frequent.

A Google spokesperson told The Register: &quot;We are focusing our resources on fewer, more comprehensive releases. This change simplifies development, gets rid of the complexity of managing multiple code branches, and allows us to deliver more stable and secure code to the AOSP community.

&quot;Our commitment to AOSP is unchanged. This new process helps us build a more robust and secure foundation for the entire Android ecosystem, ensuring AOSP remains a strong, open platform for the future.&quot;

While the slowdown will present a headache for developers and anyone building an operating system compatible with Android applications, the general consensus is that it signals a shift away from the project&#39;s original ethos toward a more restrictive approach.

One open source expert told The Reg: &quot;De-Googled Android is actually becoming fairly good and usable.&quot; He also noted there are viable non-Android phone operating systems, such as FuriOS, &quot;so it&#39;s trying to gradually make life more difficult for the third-party OS vendors and rebuilders.&quot;

Another software engineer told us: &quot;Very few devs are trying to build a mobile OS. I think from a dev perspective the F-Droid stuff is more on point as it impacts freedom to install what you like on Android.&quot;

In September 2025, the F-Droid project, which distributes open source Android applications, warned it would be at risk if Google enforced planned developer registration requirements for app installation - a system incompatible with F-Droid&#39;s model.

Google has said it remains committed to the AOSP project. However, the slow drip of changes may make some developers think otherwise. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk&#39;s X platform is under fire as UK regulators close in on mounting reports that the platform&#39;s AI chatbot, Grok, is generating sexual imagery without users&#39; consent.

Ofcom, the UK&#39;s communications regulator responsible for enforcement under the Online Safety Act (OSA), said this week it had contacted X and its xAI division to demand answers. The Information Commissioner&#39;s Office also expressed concerns.

In a statement, an Ofcom spokesperson said: &quot;We are aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok... that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.

&quot;We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response, we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.&quot;

The ICO said: &quot;We are aware of reports raising serious concerns about content produced by Grok. We have contacted X and xAI to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals&#39; rights. Once we have reviewed their response, we will quickly assess whether further action may be required.&quot;

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) claimed this week that its analysts had witnessed Grok generating child abuse images.

Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at the IWF, told Sky News Grok is creating abuse imagery which under UK law would be considered Category C material – indecent but not explicitly sexual. These Grok-generated Category C images are then fed into different AI tools to create the most serious Category A videos.

&quot;There is no excuse for releasing products to the global public which can be used to abuse and hurt people, especially children,&quot; she said.

Alexander said imagery seen by the IWF is not directly on Grok or X, but on a dark web forum where users claim to have used Grok to generate the sexualized images.

Additional research carried out by social media and deepfake investigator Genevieve Oh, reported by Bloomberg, revealed that over a 24-hour period between January 5 and 6, Grok generated around 6,700 sexualized images every hour.

Responding to the furor, UK tech secretary Liz Kendall said X must &quot;deal with this urgently.&quot;

&quot;We cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls,&quot; she said. &quot;Make no mistake, the UK will not tolerate the endless proliferation of disgusting and abusive material online. We must all come together to stamp it out.&quot;

Depending on how X responds to UK regulators, the matter could prove to be one of the biggest tests of the Online Safety Act&#39;s teeth since it came into force.

Alexander Brown, head of technology, media, and telecoms at global law firm Simmons & Simmons, noted the OSA explicitly designates sharing intimate images without consent – including AI-generated deepfakes – as a &quot;priority offence.&quot;

This means X must &quot;take proactive, proportionate steps to prevent such content from appearing on its platform and to swiftly remove it when detected,&quot; he added.

X did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

Online Safety Act violations can lead to fines of up to £18 million ($24.2 million) or 10 percent of an organization&#39;s qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. ®

Woot has an excellent deal on refurbished Sonos Arc SL soundbars, the 2020 model that’s similar to the original Arc aside from not having any microphones. It debuted for $749, but you can get one with a one-year Sonos warranty for $319.99 while supplies last. If this discount doesn’t sell out quickly (which it may), the promotion will end in two days. Definitely a nice deal considering Sonos itself offers the same model refurbished for $539.

We thought the original Sonos Arc was a big deal when it launched. Its slick design, Dolby Atmos support, and strong audio performance — not to mention that it can be added onto with other Wi-Fi Sonos speakers — still make it a solid choice for curious shoppers today. That being said, it’s not the soundbar for everyone. Aside from the aforementioned omission of microphones, which I can’t imagine being a huge con for most people, it lacks Bluetooth connectivity. This soundbar supports Wi-Fi and AirPlay 2 for wireless audio. As for wiring your gadgets, it has a sole HDMI eARC port, along with ethernet. Read our review of the standard Arc.

Building a PC or buying one is about to get even pricier.

The personal computer has remained surprisingly resilient to change over the past 15 years. Apple promised a “post-PC” era with the iPad in 2010 and failed to deliver one. Smartphones even overtook laptops as the most popular device to connect to the internet a decade ago, but millions of people still kept buying PCs every year. But this PC resiliency is going to be tested even further this year.

RAM and NAND / SSD prices have surged in recent months due to shortages created by AI data center demand. Some stores have had to sell memory like it’s lobster, prebuilt PC costs have risen, and some assemblers are even selling PCs without RAM.

Now, we’re about to see how the shortage hits regular laptops and PCs from the likes of Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, and Acer. TrendForce predicts that memory prices are projected to “rise sharply again in the first quarter of 2026.” More price rises will only put further pressure on laptop and PC pricing, and we’re seeing early signs that PC makers are adjusting prices at CES this week.

Asus announced to its channel partners this week that it’s implementing price hikes across its products as a result of the memory market conditions. Dell also adjusted the launch pricing of its XPS 14 and XPS 16 just hours before they were announced this week, in a sign that laptop pricing is going to become increasingly fluid. Lenovo has been stockpiling PC memory to try and weather the storm throughout 2026, and HP has warned it will have to increase prices and offer lower RAM configurations later this year. Like Lenovo, HP also has a stockpile of memory, but it expects the continued rise in costs will begin eating into PC product margins by May.

There’s no quick fix for PC makers, either. Offering less RAM on laptops will be difficult for manufacturers, particularly below the 8GB threshold. Windows 11 has a minimum RAM requirement of 4GB, but it doesn’t run particularly well in those conditions. While TrendForce predicts some smartphones are likely to return to just 4GB this year, “for budget notebooks, DRAM cannot be reduced quickly due to processor pairing needs and operating system limitations.”

The timing of this memory shortage couldn’t be any worse for Microsoft and its PC partners. Windows 10 just hit end of life in October, and many businesses are in the process of migrating to Windows 11. That often involves a PC refresh cycle, and there were strong signs throughout 2025 that PC shipments were accelerating thanks to a refresh of the existing install base. That momentum could be derailed later this year once RAM stockpiles are depleted.

Timing isn’t the only problem for the PC market, as the increased prices of RAM and SSDs could be permanent instead of a temporary supply constraint. “This is not just a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand, but a potentially permanent, strategic reallocation of the world’s silicon wafer capacity,” warns IDC. “For decades, the production of DRAM and NAND Flash for smartphones and PCs was the primary driver for production. Today, that dynamic has inverted.”

The demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon has pushed Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron to pivot toward building high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5 memory. “Every wafer allocated to an HBM stack for an Nvidia GPU is a wafer denied to the LPDDR5X module of a mid-range smartphone or the SSD of a consumer laptop,” says IDC.

This is going to have a big impact on the DIY market and PC gaming, too. “PC gaming is thriving at a time when overall consumer PC shipments have declined by 14 percent in the last five years… annual gaming PC shipments are up 50 percent,” said Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge last week.

The popularity of PC gaming has allowed smaller assemblers to offer custom prebuilt systems at competitive prices. These smaller builders can’t stockpile RAM or SSDs, and “will bear the greatest burden of the shortage,” warns IDC. “That in turn represents an opportunity for large OEMs to gain share from smaller assemblers in the gaming space by positioning prebuilt systems as offering higher value.”

Demand for memory looks set to impact GPU prices too. Rumors have suggested that Nvidia could force GPU partners to adjust pricing to factor in increased memory costs. “The demand for memory in the market is at record levels, and this does mean supply will be tight,” admitted Ben Berraondo, director of global PR for Nvidia GeForce, in a briefing with The Verge last week. “There have been no major changes in how we manage memory with our customers. There are no major supply chain changes to GeForce,” says Berraondo.

Despite a lack of major memory changes to GeForce, pricing is already starting to increase. Newegg has started listing a variety of RTX 5090 cards at well above $4,000. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find an RTX 5090 for under $3,000, after prices were close to the $1,999 retail price in September.

Berraondo didn’t comment directly on the rumors of $5,000 pricing for the RTX 5090, but he did point to Nvidia’s Founders Edition model still being listed at $1,999 at Best Buy. That’s great, but it’s constantly out of stock so it’s not representative of the true retail pricing of the RTX 5090.

If the costs of building a gaming PC don’t stabilize in 2026, Microsoft will also feel increased pressure on its next-gen Xbox plans. Microsoft is aggressively pivoting toward PC for the future of Xbox consoles, with the handheld Xbox Ally devices just the beginning of its plans. Component costs could force the price of the next-gen Xbox even higher and also impact Sony’s plans with the PS6 and Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine.

The memory shortage also threatens to impact Microsoft’s AI PC push. Microsoft set a surprising minimum of 16GB of RAM for its Copilot Plus PCs, in order to handle local small language models. Qualcomm has been pushing to bring Windows on Arm (Copilot Plus PCs) down to the $600 price range, but that effort looks set to reverse due to memory costs.

It increasingly feels like we’re witnessing a battle over the future of the PC, where component prices and AI features are having a big impact on computing. If AI demand wins the battle then more traditional computing tasks will increasingly be performed in the cloud. That could force businesses to increasingly move to virtual machines instead of refreshing laptops and gamers to look at cloud streaming services instead of buying an expensive gaming PC.

I don’t think this battle means the end of the PC anytime soon. It just feels like another step in Big Tech marching us toward an unproven AI future. I have faith the PC will survive and evolve and prove once again how important it truly is.

I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else.

﻿SoundTouch speakers could now have a second life, and won’t lose support until May.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

In a surprisingly user-friendly move, Bose has announced it will be open-sourcing the API documentation for its SoundTouch smart speakers, which were slated to lose official support on February 18th, as reported by Ars Technica. Bose has also moved that date back to May 6th, 2026.

When cloud support ends, an update to the SoundTouch app will add local controls to retain as much functionality as possible without cloud services. Users will still be able to stream music to SoundTouch speakers with Bluetooth, AirPlay, and Spotify Connect (plus physical AUX connections). Remote control features and grouping speakers will also continue to work, and users will still be able to set up and configure their SoundTouch speakers.

Now that the smart speakers’ API is being open-sourced, users can also create their own compatible SoundTouch tools to help fill in any gaps left by the lack of cloud services. While it’s still disappointing that the speakers are losing official support, Bose’s approach at least lets people continue using their speakers, rather than bricking otherwise functional devices.

This move from Bose is particularly surprising because of how rare it is. Usually when products lose support for cloud services, they end up bricked, and occasionally users step in themselves to fix things. For instance, when Pebble originally shut down in 2016, users kept their watches functional by creating the Rebble Alliance, a community-run replacement for the watches’ cloud services, firmware, and app store.

Microsoft’s annual Xbox Developer Direct event is taking place on January 22nd this year. The fourth Developer Direct will provide a closer look at two of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games this year, Forza Horizon 6 and Fable, as well as a first in-depth look at Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak.

Playground Games will debut the first gameplay of Forza Horizon 6 during the Developer Direct show, after first revealing that the next instalment in the Forza Horizon franchise is set in Japan. Forza Horizon 6 players will be able to experience the neon lights and buildings of Tokyo City, as well as an open world set in various other parts of Japan.

We’ve been waiting to hear more about Playground Games’ other big Xbox title, Fable, after Microsoft delayed its release to 2026. Fable appears to be on track for a release this year, which also marks 25 years of Xbox. “Devs from the Playground team will unveil the magic and mischief that awaits players in this fresh new beginning for the franchise, including a first look at some stunning new gameplay,” says Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire editor-in-chief.

Game Freak, known for its Pokémon RPG games, will also show off parts of its new Beast of Reincarnation action RPG. It’s launching at some point in 2026 on Xbox Series S / X, PS5, and PC, and in the game you’ll play as Emma, who will be accompanied by a canine friend.

This year’s Xbox Developer Direct will take place at 1PM ET / 10PM PT / 6PM UK on January 22nd and will be streamed live on on Twitch and YouTube.

            <div id="article-text">CES had a few surprises, some big TVs, and more LEDs than ever before.

CES had a few surprises, some big TVs, and more LEDs than ever before.

CES serves a few different purposes — to give us the sense of what’s to come during the year, to introduce strange devices, and for companies to show off the newest technology. While there wasn’t as much of the first as I had hoped, there sure was a lot of the latter. TV manufacturers delivered enormous displays with additional subpixels, intriguing advancements on existing technologies, and the return of a stylish and slim favorite.

First launched back in 2017, LG’s Wallpaper TV redefined what a slim TV could be. After a few years away, the Wallpaper TV has returned with the W6. This new model is only 9 millimeters thick, has carved linear patterns around its perimeter for reinforced rigidity that looks stylish, and hangs flush against the wall. The TV uses the wireless Zero Connect Box 2.0, so you don’t have a bunch of cables from your sources to the TV (there is a thin power cable at the bottom left of the TV, though). The box is 35 percent smaller than its previous iteration and supports 4K signals up to 165Hz on all its HDMI ports, making it the first TV capable of that.

The W6 uses LG’s Primary RGB Tandem 2.0 panel and Hyper Radiant Color Technology. It should have a 20 percent increase in brightness over the G5, which I measured at over 2,400 nits. The W6 also has 12-bit color depth processing, which gives it more headroom when receiving the 10-bit signal sent from sources, causing fewer artifacts.

The main TV focus of the show for TCL was on its X11L SQD-Mini LED (so much so, that there weren’t any details revealed about its other TV lines). The TV uses blue LEDs — and not the RGB LEDs that most manufacturers were showing at CES — and TCL says it’s capable of an incredible 10,000 nits of brightness, has up to 20,000 dimming zones, and covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color gamut.

This is because of two advancements TCL has made. The X11L is the only TV that uses reformulated quantum dots and an improved color filter developed by TCL CSOT (the company’s panel manufacturing division). Color on the TV looks spectacular, and thanks to all those dimming zones (and some great processing), the TV has excellent blooming control. This new innovation doesn’t come cheap, as the smallest size of 75 inches starts at $6,999.99, but it’s still a big step for mini LED.

Back in August of 2025, Samsung officially launched its first Micro RGB TV, and in the days leading up to CES announced new sizes down to 55 inches would be coming in 2026. But when the doors opened at Samsung’s First Look event at CES, it was obvious they planned to impress. Attendees were greeted by the 130-inch R95H Micro RGB TV — Samsung’s largest micro RGB display.

The TV has Samsung’s Timeless Frame, which makes it look like the TV is suspended in air within the metal frame. The R95H is capable of 100 percent of BT.2020, has a glare-free screen, and supports HDR10+ Advanced. But while it’s impressive, the TV is only a prototype, so don’t go making space in your living room.

The company that started the whole RGB LED trend that now every manufacturer is a part of, with the Hisense UX, has now upgraded it with the new 116-inch UXS. But what’s fascinating is that it’s no longer just an RGB LED TV. It’s now an RGCB LED TV, as Hisense has added a cyan LED to the backlight of the UXS.

Hisense says there are a couple benefits to adding the cyan LED. First, it helps smooth the transition between blue and green, which can be prone to color crosstalk, affecting the color purity. Plus, it also helps reduce the blue light output in the range that can cause eyestrain and fatigue, as well as affect your circadian rhythms. The extra cyan LED also bumps up the BT.2020 coverage of the UXS to 110 percent.

LG’s flagship G6 has a lot of similarities with the W6 Wallpaper TV mentioned earlier. It also uses the Primary RGB Tandem panel with Hyper Radiant Color Technology which should be 20 percent brighter than last year’s G5. LG has said that the G6 will have deeper blacks than before, and it has a reflection free technology with less than 0.5 perfect reflectance to keep those blacks nice and inky, no matter the lighting condition.

The CES show floor officially closes its doors at the end of tomorrow, but that hasn’t slowed the flood of announcements and reveals coming out of Las Vegas. If you’re struggling to stay on top of all the new tech, gadgets, concepts, and AI-powered devices as day three of CES gets underway, we’ve rounded up some of the best hardware and upgrades that have debuted so far so you can quickly get up to speed.

There’s still lots more to come, so you can check back here every day, or catch up on all of The Verge’s CES 2026 coverage here.

Two years ago at CES 2024 L’Oréal introduced its Airlight Pro hairdryer that added infrared light to speed up drying and reduce the amount of heat being applied to hair. Its new Light Straight features similar tech, but in the form of a flat iron that can be used to straighten or curl hair in just one pass. Similar hair styling tools will heat up to more than 400 degrees Fahrenheit, but L’Oréal’s Light Straight maxes out at 320 degrees while still being faster and causing less damage. It’s set to release in 2027, when pricing will also be revealed.

Most of us haven’t upgraded to Wi-Fi 7 routers yet, but technology marches on and CES 2026 saw the debut of Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips despite the fact the official IEEE 802.11bn specification may not be finalized until mid to late 2028. One of the more unusual designs at this year’s show is the Asus ROG NeoCore concept router that looks like a 20-sided role playing die with a hollow bottom. You can’t buy one yet, and the prototype broke when The Verge’s Sean Hollister picked it up, but the unusual router design hides its antennas along the internal edges of the polyhedron so it doesn’t look like an alien spider.

Motorola is no stranger to folding phones, but the company has so far stuck with clamshell-style handsets, inspired by its iconic ultra-thin cellphone. At CES 2026, Motorola announced its first book-style folding smartphone featuring a 6.6-inch outer screen, an 8.1-inch 2K LTPO inner display, a trio of 50-megapixel cameras on the back, a 32-megapixel selfie camera on the front, and a 20-megapixel camera inside. The Verge’s Allison Johnson went hands on with the new Razr Fold, but couldn’t get Motorola to reveal pricing when the phone launches in North America this summer.

After releasing a cute donut-shaped wireless charger in December, Ikea announced two new Matter-compatible lighting products at CES 2026 including an upgraded version of its Varmblixt donut lamp. The original version had a glossy reflective finish, but the new Varmblixt has a matte finish to diffuse and accentuate its internal LED lighting. When it launches in April 2026 for $99.99, the smart donut lamp will come with one of Ikea’s new Bilresa remotes that can be used to cycle through 12 color presets. You can also pair the lamp to Ikea’s Dirigera hub and Ikea Home Smart app to gain access to additional color settings.

Most red and infrared light therapy masks are rigid and chunky making you look like an old-timey hockey goalie ready for a game as you climb into bed. L’Oréal’s new LED face mask is instead made from a thin, lightweight, and flexible material that’s more comfortable and also positions its lighting closer to your face. As a result, instead of having to wear it for 10 to 20 minutes, the company says you only need to wear L’Oréal’s mask for five to 10 minutes to treat lines and wrinkles. Pricing isn’t known, and you’ll have to wait until at least 2027 to buy one, pending FDA clearance.

In addition to new Matter-compatible lamps, Ikea announced a new Bluetooth speaker during its CES debut. Besides its compact size (measuring just 3 inches on its longest side) and striking white, dark pink, and lime green color options, the Kallsup speaker’s most compelling feature will be its $10 price tag when it launches in April 2026. The Kallsup is “surprisingly loud,” according to The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, but if you need more decibels you can pair and sync up to 100 of them to fill your entire home with sound.

How does Lenovo plan to top the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 laptop it debuted at CES 2025 with a rollable screen that expands vertically from 14- to 16.7-inches? By turning the feature on its side. Lenovo’s new Pro Rollable gaming laptop’s screen expands horizontally from 16 inches with a 16:10 aspect ratio to an ultrawide 24 inches. It’s based on the Legion Pro 7i and will potentially feature an Intel Core Ultra processor paired with Nvidia’s flagship RTX 5090 laptop GPU, but the Pro Rollable is strictly a concept at this time.

A year ago, Roborock debuted its Saros Z70 robot vacuum at CES 2025 with an articulated robotic arm that could reach in front of the robovac to pick up items like socks instead of running them over. The company’s new Saros Rover vacuum also features appendages, but in the form of two extending legs with wheels the robot can use to climb and clean stairs. A robovac that can clean multiple floors of a home by navigating stairs isn’t a new idea, but the Saros Rover can also clean each step as it climbs — albeit very slowly based on demos at CES 2026. There’s no timeline for a release yet as Roborock says it’s still in development, but the Saros Rover isn’t just a concept.

For the first time since Corsair acquired Elgato in 2018, the company is incorporating Stream Deck controls into a wired mechanical gaming keyboard. The keyboard side of the Corsair Galleon 100 SD has features like an 8,000Hz polling rate and a hot-swappable PCB that uses MLX Pulse switches, while on the other side you’ll find an integrated Stream Deck Plus with 12 customizable buttons, a pair of rotary dials, and a 5-inch multipurpose 720 x 1280 IPS display. It will be available starting on January 29th but is now available for preorder for $349.99.

Originally announced as a concept design at IFA 2024, Lenovo is turning the Auto Twist AI PC into a real laptop, now called the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist laptop. Like the original, it features a 14-inch screen mounted to a motorized pivoting hinge that can automatically open the laptop for you with a knock on the lid or track your head and adjust its orientation to match your posture or position. You’ll be able to buy one in June with prices starting at $1,649.

Razer thinks headphones, not glasses, are the future of AI wearables, as demonstrated by its Project Motoko concept headphones that The Verge’s Victoria Song tried at CES 2026. Project Motoko looks similar to Razer’s wireless gaming headphones but adds a pair of 4K cameras positioned at eye level, near and far field microphones, and AI. The headphones are powered by an unnamed Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and compatible with major AI models that are used to identify images and sounds, or respond to your requests. Battery life has been tested to up to 36 hours, which eclipses all the AI smart glasses on the market.

Anker’s solution to open-ear wireless headphones that can quiet the world around you is a transforming design that positions the AeroFit 2 Pro’s drivers closer to the ear canal. The new $249.95 Shokz OpenFit Pro take a different approach. Instead of true ANC that requires a sealed ear canal, the open-ear buds offer noise reduction using a triple microphone array, a new speaker design, and an adaptive algorithm that generates audio to dampen unwanted sounds. The Verge’s Victoria Song found they worked surprisingly well and was also impressed with the OpenFit Pro’s improved bass performance, which is one place where open-ear headphones often disappoint.

In need of a lot of pixels and ports on your desk? Dell’s UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the world’s first 52-inch 6K display and features a 21:9 aspect ratio, a resolution of up to 6,144 x 2,560 at 120Hz, and a slight curve. It also doubles as a dock and includes two HDMI 2.1 ports, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and a bunch of upstream and downstream USB-C and USB-A ports, including a Thunderbolt 4 port that can deliver up to 140W of power. It’s available now for $2,899 with a stand, or $2,799 if you want to provide your own.

Does your butt deserve more than just a comfy place to sit? Razer thinks so and has incorporated several of its existing gaming chair accessories into a proof of concept called Project Madison. It’s like the Frankenstein’s monster of gaming chairs incorporating THX-certified speakers with spatial audio, dual RGB light strips, and six haptic motors in the cushions pulsing force feedback effects into your back and below. There’s no pricing estimates, as Razer hasn’t announced if Project Madison will ever go into production.

Our biggest complaint with the original version of OhSnap’s MCON sliding gamepad is that it makes your phone too thick to slip into a pocket or comfortably carry while it’s attached. That problem is potentially being solved with two new versions that debuted at CES 2026. The $100 MCON Slim uses touchpads instead of thumbsticks, while the $60 MCON Lite uses joysticks similar to what’s found on the Nintendo 3Ds. But neither of the thinner versions features the original’s spring-loaded sliding mechanism, so there’s a definite tradeoff.

The Wolverine V3 BT isn’t just another wireless controller featuring drift-resistant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks. It’s also the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth with a a sub-3ms response time. But there’s a catch. As the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program, the Wolverine V3 BT only uses ultra-low latency Bluetooth when connected to an LG TV running webOS 25. All other devices will connect to it using standard Bluetooth. Pricing and availability haven’t been finalized.

New OLED gaming monitors making their debut in 2026 should have clearer and sharper text thanks to panel makers Samsung Display and LG Display now lining up the colors of their subpixels in vertical RGB stripes. The improved OLED panels are already being supplied to companies like MSI, and Gigabyte, and at CES 2026, Asus announced three gaming monitors featuring the new “RGB stripe” screen tech. Pricing and availability aren’t known, but the 27-inch ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM will also use Tandem OLED tech for increased brightness and longevity, while the 34-inch ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDN and the ROG Strix OLED XG34WCDMS will feature quantum dot OLED panels.

Smart door locks that conveniently automatically unlock as you approach aren’t a new idea, but they typically rely on a mix of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, geofencing, and apps that are frequently unreliable. Aqara’s new $269.99 U400 smart deadbolt lock is the first to work with Apple’s Home Key’s hands-free unlocking using the U1 ultra-wideband (UWB) chip found in many iPhones and Apple Watches, without the need for a special app. The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy had the chance to test the new smart lock for a week and found it “worked every time without any waiting,” making it a “significant upgrade” for their front door.

Although it’s currently just an R&D concept, Samsung Display showcased a new folding OLED panel that doesn’t have the visible crease that every foldable phone on the market exhibits when they’re opened. Samsung Display has been a longtime panel provider for Apple, so could this be the OLED screen that will be used in the rumored foldable iPhone?

Acer announced several new laptops at CES 2026, but the standout is its Swift 16 AI featuring what the company claims is the world’s largest haptic trackpad. It will give your fingers a good workout as they slide back and forth across its wide expanse, but the laptop includes a stylus, turning the trackpad into a tablet for sketching or annotating documents. The Swift 16 AI will be available with Intel Panther Lake chips (up to the Core Ultra X9 388H), plenty of ports, and an optional OLED display when it launches in Q1 2026.

Want the portability of a laptop without the cramped keyboard? HP crammed an entire mini desktop computer into its new Eliteboard G1a keyboard, including an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series chip, stereo speakers, RAM, storage, a cooling fan, and ports. It can be connected to up to two 4K displays using a daisy-chain connection and paired to a Bluetooth mouse. Pricing hasn’t been announced, but the G1a is expected to launch in March.

Samsung debuted one of the more impressive TVs at CES this year with a monstrous 130-inch Micro RGB TV featuring a frame designed to “appear less like a television and more like a vast, immersive window that visually expands the room,” according to a release from the company. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but the TV will most likely be one of those upgrades that if you have to ask how much it costs, it’s probably not in your budget.

Lego doesn’t regularly exhibit at CES, but at this year’s show it announced its new Smart Play platform that’s debuting in three new Star Wars building sets in March. The platform relies on a new 2x4 Lego Smart Brick featuring interactive LED lighting, wireless connectivity, a speaker, microphone, and various sensors that can detect light, movements, tilting, and gestures. The Smart Brick works alongside NFC-equipped smart tags (Lego tile pieces) and minifigures to enable new interactive play opportunities. You can use the Smart Brick to trigger crash sounds when a Lego racecar flips over, for example, or start playing The Imperial March when the new Emperor Palpatine figure is placed on his throne.

Using an adjustable ear-hook design that repositions the drivers at the entrance of your ear canal, the Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro are one of the first wireless open-ear headphones that can be converted to an earbuds mode with active noise cancellation. You have the option of naturally hearing the world around you along with your music or podcasts, or blocking out your environment entirely. They’re available now through Anker’s online store for $179.99, but battery life maxes out at just 7 hours with the headphones alone, or up to 34 when paired with their charging case.

Amazon is jumping on the art TV bandwagon with its new 4K edge-lit LED Ember Artline TV. Available this spring in 55 to 65-inch sizes starting at $899, the TV has a matte finish to make photos and artwork look less like a screen and more like artwork hanging on your wall. Amazon is giving customers their choice of 10 different frame styles to help match their room, while the TV can provide personalized recommendations for artwork that will best match the decor based on photos of the room where it’s installed.

Anker’s latest floor-mopping robovac will make your home smell better one way or another. Launching later this month for $1,599, the Eufy S2 is rated at up to 30,000Pa of suction, uses AI-powered obstacle detection and real-time 3D mapping to navigate your home and avoid obstacles, and has a retractable mop head that cleans itself with electrolyzed water. If that doesn’t alleviate bad smells, the Eufy S2 can instead mask them using a built-in aromatherapy dispenser with scents that include citrus, bamboo, basil, or sage.

Samsung hasn’t changed much with the design of its third-generation Freestyle projector. The new Freestyle Plus still looks like an oversize soda can and features an integrated stand, speakers, and Wi-Fi. But it’s nearly twice as bright as its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and it’s getting a host of new AI-powered automatic adjustment features. We got to try them out at CES 2026 and were impressed with the Freestyle Plus’ ability to automatically correct its alignment when projected on challenging surfaces like the corner of a room or even a wavy curtain.

8BitDo originally made a name for itself with budget-friendly but well-featured alternatives to Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft’s controllers. It’s still very good at that, but 8BitDo’s new Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox will be its most expensive gamepad when it launches in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99 and one of its most customizable. If tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops, and official Xbox support (using a USB dongle) aren’t enough to sell you on the 3E, it also comes with interchangeable button modules letting you choose between membrane buttons and clicky micro switches.

First announced last month, The Verge’s Allison Johnson finally got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Z TriFold that uses a pair of inward-folding hinges to expand from a chunky phone to a large tablet. For now it’s only available in Korea, but the Z TriFold is expected to be available in the US sometime in Q1 2026 for what will most likely be a hefty chunk of change. Its biggest selling point, according to Johnson, is the potential to carry around a laptop replacement in your pocket. “The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.”

If you always seem to remember what groceries you need after you get home from the store, GE Appliances’ new package-scanning fridge can help you create a comprehensive shopping list. Launching in April 2026 for $4,899, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant has a scanner on the front you can use to scan empty packages, and you can manually add items to a shopping list using an 8-inch tablet on the door. There’s even a camera inside the fridge you can remotely access through an app to check if you’ve run out of something while you’re shopping.

Clicks is best known for its smartphone cases that add a physical BlackBerry-style compact keyboard. Its latest creation has that same keyboard, but also a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, a headphone jack, and a 5G data connection, and it runs Android 16. The Clicks Communicator is designed to be an alternative to your daily driver smartphone that you can limit to essential apps to minimize distractions. At $499 it’s priced similarly to the Pixel 9A, but you can reserve one now for a limited time to get a discount.

As TCL and Hisense have done, LG is looking to usurp the dominance of Samsung’s The Frame in the art TV category. Its new LG Gallery TV leverages the company’s Gallery+ service that launched earlier this year to display everything from art to gaming scenes. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with what is likely a matte coating, but LG describes it as having a “specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience.” It comes with a white frame, and while you can purchase additional wood-colored frames, pricing for the LG Gallery TV hasn’t been announced.

LG’s CLOiD is a home robot that can potentially do more than just clean your floors. The robot features a pair of articulated arms with seven degrees of motion mounted to a mobile base with a torso that can tilt and bend. LG says CLOiD can perform household tasks like folding and stacking laundry, putting food in the oven, or fetching something from your fridge. Can it do that faster or more reliably than you can? That remains to be seen, but CLOiD could be even more useful as a mobile smart home hub you can converse with as it follows you around the house.

Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges aren’t new, but the company will soon be introducing a new feature for added convenience: voice-activated door opening and closing. When your hands are full of groceries, or are dirty while you’re whipping up a meal, you’ll be able to ask Bixby to “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and it will open over 90 degrees giving you full access. If your mouth is full of food and you can’t properly articulate what you want, the door can also be opened or closed using a tap of your palm or the back of your hand.

If you pulled a Honey, I Shrunk the Kids on the Las Vegas Sphere, you’d end up with something like SwitchBot’s new dome-shaped Obboto RGB desk lamp. It’s wrapped in over 2,900 color-changing LEDs and can display preset animations, animated GIFs, AI-powered “mood animations,” music visualizers, or just the local weather and time if you want to be practical. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet.

Petkit’s new automatic pet feeder that can dole out up to seven days of wet food isn’t just about alleviating guilt about leaving your furry friend behind while you travel. The Yumshare Daily Feast uses an NFC tracking system to remove meals that haven’t been eaten in 48 hours and UVC lighting to sanitize the system for delivering fresh ones. What’s potentially even more useful is an AI-powered 1080p night vision camera that tracks when and how much your pet eats to provide insights on their diet and possible health issues. It’s expected to launch in April 2026 and will be sold through pet food companies.

Six years after its first Wallpaper TV debuted in 2017, LG has revived the line with its new LG OLED evo W6. The TV is 9mm thick thanks to its redesigned internal architecture and features a new mount so it can sit completely flush against a wall. Further improving installation is the W6’s use of LG’s Zero Connect Box which wireless sends a video signal from up to 33 feet away. The only physical cable you need to route to the W6 is for power. It will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.

GameSir may have already clinched the title for weirdest controller at CES 2026. The company shared more details about its upcoming Swift Drive gamepad that features a small steering wheel in the middle of the controller. The wheel’s connected to a high-precision Hall effect encoder and an equally small direct drive motor that provides force feedback effects while playing racing games and sims. There are additional haptic motors located in the gamepad’s Hall effect triggers to simulate effects like ABS braking, and it’s got RGB lighting effects that can be synced to your game. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed yet.

It’s not quite as adorable as the furry Mirumi robot that debuted at last year’s CES, but Yukai Engineering’s new Baby FuFu is potentially more practical. It looks like a cuddly cat that’s huffing and puffing and features an internal fan that will keep young kids cool while preventing tiny fingers from reaching any dangerous moving parts. It’s expected to arrive in mid-2026 for $50 to $60.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

Inside the strange limbo facing millions of IVF embryosMillions of embryos created through IVF sit frozen in time, stored in cryopreservation tanks around the world. The number is only growing thanks to advances in technology, the rising popularity of IVF, and improvements in its success rates.At a basic level, an embryo is simply a tiny ball of a hundred or so cells. But unlike other types of body tissue, it holds the potential for life. Many argue that this endows embryos with a special moral status, one that requires special protections.The problem is that no one can really agree on what that status is. So while these embryos persist in suspended animation, patients, clinicians, embryologists, and legislators must grapple with the essential question of what we should do with them. What do these embryos mean to us? Who should be responsible for them? Read the full story.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <h2>Deploying a hybrid approach to Web3 in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after.

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.

I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it’s a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work. And I’m not just saying that because he’s my boss. (Hi, Boss!)

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

Think back to middle school algebra, like 2a + b. Those letters are parameters: Assign them values and you get a result. In math or coding, parameters are used to set limits or determine output. The parameters inside LLMs work in a similar way, just on a mind-boggling scale.

Short answer: an algorithm. When a model is trained, each parameter is set to a random value. The training process then involves an iterative series of calculations (known as training steps) that update those values. In the early stages of training, a model will make errors. The training algorithm looks at each error and goes back through the model, tweaking the value of each of the model’s many parameters so that next time that error is smaller. This happens over and over again until the model behaves in the way its makers want it to. At that point, training stops and the values of the model’s parameters are fixed.

In theory! In practice, because LLMs are trained on so much data and contain so many parameters, training them requires a huge number of steps and an eye-watering amount of computation. During training, the 175 billion parameters inside a medium-size LLM like GPT-3 will each get updated tens of thousands of times. In total, that adds up to quadrillions (a number with 15 zeros) of individual calculations. That’s why training an LLM takes so much energy. We’re talking about thousands of specialized high-speed computers running nonstop for months.

There are three different types of parameters inside an LLM that get their values assigned through training: embeddings, weights, and biases. Let’s take each of those in turn.

An embedding is the mathematical representation of a word (or part of a word, known as a token) in an LLM’s vocabulary. An LLM’s vocabulary, which might contain up to a few hundred thousand unique tokens, is set by its designers before training starts. But there’s no meaning attached to those words. That comes during training.

When a model is trained, each word in its vocabulary is assigned a numerical value that captures the meaning of that word in relation to all the other words, based on how the word appears in countless examples across the model’s training data.

Yeah. But there’s a bit more to it. The numerical value—the embedding—that represents each word is in fact a list of numbers, with each number in the list representing a different facet of meaning that the model has extracted from its training data. The length of this list of numbers is another thing that LLM designers can specify before an LLM is trained. A common size is 4,096.

Yup, that’s an embedding. And each of those numbers is tweaked during training. An LLM with embeddings that are 4,096 numbers long is said to have 4,096 dimensions.

It might look like a strange number. But LLMs (like anything that runs on a computer chip) work best with powers of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. LLM engineers have found that 4,096 is a power of two that hits a sweet spot between capability and efficiency. Models with fewer dimensions are less capable; models with more dimensions are too expensive or slow to train and run.

Using more numbers allows the LLM to capture very fine-grained information about how a word is used in many different contexts, what subtle connotations it might have, how it relates to other words, and so on.

Back in February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, the firm’s largest LLM yet (some estimates have put its parameter count at more than 10 trillion). Nick Ryder, a research scientist at OpenAI who worked on the model, told me at the time that bigger models can work with extra information, like emotional cues, such as when a speaker’s words signal hostility: “All of these subtle patterns that come through a human conversation—those are the bits that these larger and larger models will pick up on.”

The upshot is that all the words inside an LLM get encoded into a high-dimensional space. Picture thousands of words floating in the air around you. Words that are closer together have similar meanings. For example, “table” and “chair” will be closer to each other than they are to “astronaut,” which is close to “moon” and “Musk.” Way off in the distance you can see “prestidigitation.” It’s a little like that, but instead of being related to each other across three dimensions, the words inside an LLM are related across 4,096 dimensions.

It’s dizzying stuff. In effect, an LLM compresses the entire internet into a single monumental mathematical structure that encodes an unfathomable amount of interconnected information. It’s both why LLMs can do astonishing things and why they’re impossible to fully understand.

A weight is a parameter that represents the strength of a connection between different parts of a model—and one of the most common types of dial for tuning a model’s behavior. Weights are used when an LLM processes text.

When an LLM reads a sentence (or a book chapter), it first looks up the embeddings for all the words and then passes those embeddings through a series of neural networks, known as transformers, that are designed to process sequences of data (like text) all at once. Every word in the sentence gets processed in relation to every other word.

This is where weights come in. An embedding represents the meaning of a word without context. When a word appears in a specific sentence, transformers use weights to process the meaning of that word in that new context. (In practice, this involves multiplying each embedding by the weights for all other words.)

Biases are another type of dial that complement the effects of the weights. Weights set the thresholds at which different parts of a model fire (and thus pass data on to the next part). Biases are used to adjust those thresholds so that an embedding can trigger activity even when its value is low. (Biases are values that are added to an embedding rather than multiplied with it.)

By shifting the thresholds at which parts of a model fire, biases allow the model to pick up information that might otherwise be missed. Imagine you’re trying to hear what somebody is saying in a noisy room. Weights would amplify the loudest voices the most; biases are like a knob on a listening device that pushes quieter voices up in the mix.

Here’s the TL;DR: Weights and biases are two different ways that an LLM extracts as much information as it can out of the text it is given. And both types of parameters are adjusted over and over again during training to make sure they do this.

No, neurons are more a way to organize all this math—containers for the weights and biases, strung together by a web of pathways between them. It’s all very loosely inspired by biological neurons inside animal brains, with signals from one neuron triggering new signals from the next and so on.

Each neuron in a model holds a single bias and weights for every one of the model’s dimensions. In other words, if a model has 4,096 dimensions—and therefore its embeddings are lists of 4,096 numbers—then each of the neurons in that model will hold one bias and 4,096 weights.

Neurons are arranged in layers. In most LLMs, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the layer above. A 175-billion-parameter model like GPT-3 might have around 100 layers with a few tens of thousands of neurons in each layer. And each neuron is running tens of thousands of computations at a time.

When an LLM processes a piece of text, the numerical representation of that text—the embedding—gets passed through multiple layers of the model. In each layer, the value of the embedding (that list of 4,096 numbers) gets updated many times by a series of computations involving the model’s weights and biases (attached to the neurons) until it gets to the final layer.

The idea is that all the meaning and nuance and context of that input text is captured by the final value of the embedding after it has gone through a mind-boggling series of computations. That value is then used to calculate the next word that the LLM should spit out.

It won’t be a surprise that this is more complicated than it sounds: The model in fact calculates, for every word in its vocabulary, how likely that word is to come next and ranks the results. It then picks the top word. (Kind of. See below …)

That word is appended to the previous block of text, and the whole process repeats until the LLM calculates that the most likely next word to spit out is one that signals the end of its output.

LLM designers can also specify a handful of other parameters, known as hyperparameters. The main ones are called temperature, top-p, and top-k.

Temperature is a parameter that acts as a kind of creativity dial. It influences the model’s choice of what word comes next. I just said that the model ranks the words in its vocabulary and picks the top one. But the temperature parameter can be used to push the model to choose the most probable next word, making its output more factual and relevant, or a less probable word, making the output more surprising and less robotic.

Top-p and top-k are two more dials that control the model’s choice of next words. They are settings that force the model to pick a word at random from a pool of most probable words instead of the top word. These parameters affect how the model comes across—quirky and creative versus trustworthy and dull.

That’s one of the hottest questions in AI right now. There are a lot of different ways it can happen. Researchers have found that the amount of training data makes a huge difference. First you need to make sure the model sees enough data: An LLM trained on too little text won’t make the most of all its parameters, and a smaller model trained on the same amount of data could outperform it.

Another trick researchers have hit on is overtraining. Showing models far more data than previously thought necessary seems to make them perform better. The result is that a small model trained on a lot of data can outperform a larger model trained on less data. Take Meta’s Llama LLMs. The 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 was trained on around 2 trillion words of text; the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 was trained on around 15 trillion words of text. The far smaller Llama 3 is the better model.

A third technique, known as distillation, uses a larger model to train a smaller one. The smaller model is trained not only on the raw training data but also on the outputs of the larger model’s internal computations. The idea is that the hard-won lessons encoded in the parameters of the larger model trickle down into the parameters of the smaller model, giving it a boost.

In fact, the days of single monolithic models may be over. Even the largest models on the market, like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3, can be thought of as several small models in a trench coat. Using a technique called “mixture of experts,” large models can turn on just the parts of themselves (the “experts”) that are required to process a specific piece of text. This combines the abilities of a large model with the speed and lower power consumption of a small one.

But that’s not the end of it. Researchers are still figuring out ways to get the most out of a model’s parameters. As the gains from straight-up scaling tail off, jacking up the number of parameters no longer seems to make the difference it once did. It’s not so much how many you have, but what you do with them.

You want to see a parameter? Knock yourself out: Here&#39;s an embedding.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.
