            <h2>Verizon acknowledges "pain" of new unlock policy, suggests change is coming</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-might-drop-its-annoying-35-day-wait-for-unlocking-paid-off-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following our report last week that Verizon is forcing people to wait 35 days for phone unlocks after paying off device installment plans, Verizon is apparently trying to eliminate the inconvenient delay. But Verizon hasn’t confirmed the plan to Ars, and a Verizon statement published by Android Authority yesterday did not provide any timeline for implementing the change.

As a refresher, an update to Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposed a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off the remaining balance of a device installment plan online, in the Verizon app, or with a Verizon gift card. There’s also a 35-day waiting period after paying off an installment plan over the phone or at a Verizon Authorized Retailer.

Saying restrictions are needed to counter fraud, Verizon will only unlock a phone immediately when someone pays off their device-plan balance at a Verizon corporate store or when someone pays off an installment plan on schedule via automatic payments. If you’re partway into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and pay off the remaining balance early, but without making a trip to a Verizon corporate store, you’d have to wait 35 days for an unlock that would allow you to switch the phone to a different carrier’s network.

Verizon reportedly said it is trying to change that “really soon,” but provided no specific or even estimated rollout date. Android Authority reported yesterday that it received a statement from Verizon saying, “we’ve already rolled out immediate unlocking for customers who pay at our corporate stores or use automated payment methods, since those systems can validate transactions in real-time. For other channels such as our app or authorized retailers, the 35-day window is strictly focused on fraud prevention, ensuring payments are fully cleared. That said, we recognize this is a pain point for our customers and our goal is to provide an immediate device unlock for all payment methods really soon. Our teams are diligently working to bridge that gap and we’ll update the website/policy when this is possible.”

Verizon did not mention this plan when we contacted the company’s public relations team on Friday. At the time, Verizon confirmed the current policy but didn’t say whether it had any plans to change it. We contacted Verizon again yesterday morning and today about the statement reported by Android Authority and have not received a response.

Shortly after or around the time this article was published today, PCMag reported that it received a statement from Verizon indicating that the 35-day delay will be dropped for online payments in a matter of weeks. A Verizon spokesperson “said that several weeks from now, the company would add an extra layer of authentication to its site for credit-card payments that would exempt device payoffs from the 35-day hold,” according to PCMag.

Until recently, Verizon had the most consumer-friendly unlocking policy of the major nationwide wireless carriers in the US. This was because of rules imposed on Verizon’s 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions on the firm’s purchase of TracFone, which resulted in phones being unlocked after 60 days.

Verizon used to sell phones that were already unlocked, but in 2019, it obtained a waiver from the Federal Communications Commission allowing it to lock phones for 60 days to deter fraud. Verizon subsequently claimed that even the 60-day period wasn’t long enough to stop fraud, and last month received another waiver that lifted the unlocking requirement.

Verizon started overhauling its unlocking policies after receiving the latest waiver, and the rollout has been confusing. When the new policy was put online with an effective date of January 27, it applied the 35-day delay only to cases in which a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance.

As we reported, Verizon last week changed that language on the policy page to apply the 35-day delay in more scenarios, but did not change the January 27 effective date. The Verizon statement quoted by Android Authority yesterday said the full terms were presented to customers starting on January 27 even though those terms weren’t fully described on the webpage.

“Regarding the website update timing, the new device unlocking policy went into effect on January 27th,” the Verizon statement said. “Customers purchasing or upgrading from that date were (and are being) presented with the full terms of the new policy at their point of sale. We’ll make sure all our public-facing info is also clear and consistent across channels.”

But information still is not “clear and consistent across channels,” even when it comes to terms presented directly to phone buyers. For example, the version of the device unlocking policy on Verizon’s webpage for ordering an iPhone 17 says the 35-day delay only applies when a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance. We found the same language today in Verizon’s listings for other iPhones and devices made by Google, Samsung, and Motorola.

This version of the policy presented to phone buyers would lead a consumer to believe that a phone will be unlocked automatically once the device financing agreement balance is paid in full, as long as a gift card isn’t used. That is not accurate, as we described in this article and our article last week.

In one more development we found after this article published, Verizon changed its device unlocking policy again today and updated the effective date to February 18. The new policy is similar to an older version; it details the 35-day unlocking delay after gift card payments but deletes the part that applied the 35-day delay to payments made online or in the Verizon app. This omission is curious because Verizon’s statements to other media outlets indicate that the 35-day delay is still in place for online payments.

The omission is apparently explained by new language in the policy that says, “A secure payment method is required to unlock a device immediately when paying the full device balance.” But as far as we know, the only “secure payment methods” that currently result in an immediate unlock require paying in a Verizon corporate store. While a separate Verizon FAQ still describes the in-store limitation, a user reading the policy after today’s update may be given the false belief that paying off a device on Verizon’s website will result in an immediate unlock.

The Verizon unlocking policy discussed so far in this article is for postpaid customers. Verizon’s policy for prepaid customers locks phones to its network “until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service.”

AT&T’s unlocking policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&T imposes a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones.

This article was updated with another change to Verizon’s unlocking policy and a statement reported by PCMag.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2026 is looking like a pretty good year for affordable electric vehicles. There’s a new Nissan Leaf that starts at a hair under $30,000 (as long as you ignore the destination charge). We’ll soon drive the reborn Chevrolet Bolt—with a new lithium iron phosphate battery, it also has a price tag starting with a two (again, ignoring the destination charge). And the closer you get to $40,000, the more your options expand: the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Chevy Equinox EV, Toyota bZ, Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Subaru Solterra all fall within that price bracket, and some of those are pretty good cars.

But what if you only want to spend a fraction of that? Well, you won’t be buying anything new, but then neither do three-quarters of American car buyers, and there’s nothing wrong with that. A few weeks ago, we looked at what passes for the used EV bargain basement—ones that cost $5,000 or less. As long as you’re OK with limited range and slow charging, going electric on a shoestring is possible. But if you’re prepared to spend twice that, it turns out you’ve got plenty of options.

As before, we stress that you should have a reliable place to charge an EV if you’re going to buy one, which means at home at night or at work during the day. At this price range, you’re unlikely to find something that DC fast charges quickly, and relying on public AC charging sounds stressful. You’ll probably find a car with some battery degradation, but for the vast majority of models that use active battery cooling, this should be minimal; about 2 percent a year appears to be the average.

EVs in the US usually come with an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty for the battery, although cars in this price range will probably be too old to take advantage of it. If you can, have the car checked out by an independent EV specialist; if not, for some models, there are apps you can use. Even a test drive would work, particularly if you can fully recharge it and see how much range the car reports.

In this price range, you should find plenty of two of Ars’ favorite small EVs: the BMW i3 and the Chevy Bolt. The i3 was one of the first EVs we tested; it appeared on the market around the same time Ars started covering cars. Even now, more than a decade later, there’s some seriously cool stuff in an i3. You’re unlikely to find any other car with a carbon fiber passenger cell for this little money, for one thing. And the interior is still one of the most stylish you’ll find on four wheels. It’s the perfect size for city traffic, and it handles pretty well, too.

Of course, it’s not the perfect EV. Its tires are an odd size and expensive to replace. And in this price range, you’re more likely to find earlier cars that came with a 22 kWh pack and a range of 81 miles (130 km), although for model year 2017, that increased to 33 kWh and 114 miles (183 km), making these the ones to look for. But plenty of i3s can also be found with the range extender, a two-cylinder motorbike engine that adds another 60 or 70 miles (97–112 km). And it is a true range extender—the little engine can’t directly drive the rear wheels; purists take note.

Similarly, we were smitten with the Chevy Bolt from our very first time behind the wheel at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. The following year, the little Bolt hit the market as the first affordable EV to offer more than 200 miles of range on a full battery: 238 miles (383 km) to be precise. That might not sound like a lot in 2026, when people expect a new EV to get 300 miles (482 km) between charges, but back then, it was plenty compared to the likes of the i3 or the compliance cars offered by other OEMs. And Tesla’s Model 3 was still some way away, remember.

The Bolt is efficient, but can also be a hoot to drive, especially if you fit it with tires that prioritize grip over low rolling resistance. Some people find the front seats uncomfortable. And it will only accept DC fast charges at up to 55 kW, but as long as you understand that up front, road trips are more than possible. Early Bolts—the ones in this price range—should have had their battery replaced as part of a $1.8 billion recall.

You’ll find lots of Nissan Leafs for less than $10,000, a mix of first- and second-generation models. Unlike the new Leaf, these don’t have active battery cooling, and thus will be subject to more battery degradation and therefore lost range than alternatives. (There’s a smartphone app you can use to interrogate the battery.) The Leaf is competent, but wouldn’t be our first pick over the Bolt.

If you’re feeling a bit quirky, consider a compliance car. You’ll find Volkswagen e-Golfs, electric Ford Focuses, Kia Souls, and even some Toyota RAV4s and Mercedes-Benz B-classes, the latter two both using Tesla-supplied powertrains. As all of these are less common, it’s probably worth investigating how easily you can get them fixed if something breaks.

And there are quite a few used Teslas within our budget. Mostly these are an older Model S with stratospheric mileages, but friend-of-Ars, the Late Brake Show’s Jonny Smith, bought a Tesla with more than 260,000 miles last year and seems to be doing OK with it. This includes benefiting from free Supercharging, although this does not apply to every Model S. And at this price, everyone will think you bought the car well before Elon took off the mask.</div>

            <h2>Lawsuit: EPA revoking greenhouse gas finding risks “thousands of avoidable deaths”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/lawsuit-epa-revoking-greenhouse-gas-finding-risks-thousands-of-avoidable-deaths/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency was accused of abandoning its mission to protect public health after repealing an “endangerment finding” that has served as the basis for federal climate change regulations for 17 years.

The lawsuit came from more than a dozen environmental and health groups, including the American Public Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), the Clean Air Council, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The groups have asked the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the EPA decision, which also eliminated requirements controlling greenhouse gas emissions in new cars and trucks. Urging a return to the status quo, the groups argued that the Trump administration is anti-science and illegally moving to benefit the fossil fuel industry, despite a mountain of evidence demonstrating the deadly consequences of unchecked pollution and climate change-induced floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes.

“Undercutting the ability of the federal government to tackle the largest source of climate pollution is deadly serious,” Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate at NRDC, said in an EDF roundup of statements from plaintiffs.

The science is overwhelmingly clear, the groups argued, despite the Trump EPA attempting to muddy the waters by forming a since-disbanded working group of climate contrarians.

Trump is a longtime climate denier, as evidenced by a Euro News tracker monitoring his most controversial comments. Most recently, during a cold snap affecting much of the US, he predictably trolled environmentalists, writing on Truth Social, “could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING?”

The EPA’s final rule summary bragged that “this is the single largest deregulatory action in US history and will save Americans over $1.3 trillion” by 2055. Supposedly, carmakers will pass on any savings from no longer having to meet emissions requirements, giving Americans more access to affordable cars by shutting down expensive emissions and EV mandates “strangling” the auto industry. Sounding nothing like an agency created to monitor pollutants, a fact sheet on the final rule emphasized that Trump’s EPA “chooses consumer choice over climate change zealotry every time.”

Critics quickly slammed Trump’s claims that removing the endangerment finding would help the economy. Any savings from cheaper vehicles or reduced costs of charging infrastructure (as Americans ostensibly buy fewer EVs) would be offset by $1.4 trillion “in additional costs from increased fuel purchases, vehicle repair and maintenance, insurance, traffic congestion, and noise,” The Guardian reported. The EPA’s economic analysis also ignores public health costs, the groups suing alleged. David Pettit, an attorney at the CBD’s Climate Law Institute, slammed the EPA’s messaging as an attempt to sway consumers without explaining the true costs.

“Nobody but Big Oil profits from Trump trashing climate science and making cars and trucks guzzle and pollute more,” Pettit said. “Consumers will pay more to fill up, and our skies and oceans will fill up with more pollution.”

If the court sides with the EPA, “people everywhere will face more pollution, higher costs, and thousands of avoidable deaths,” Peter Zalzal, EDF’s associate vice president of clean air strategies, said.

For environmentalists, the decision to sue the EPA was risky but necessary. By putting up a fight, they risk a court potentially reversing the 2009 Supreme Court ruling requiring the EPA to conduct the initial endangerment analysis and then regulate any pollution found from greenhouse gases.

Seemingly, that reversal is what the Trump administration has been angling for, hoping the case will reach the Supreme Court, which is more conservative today and perhaps less likely to read the Clean Air Act as broadly as the 2009 court.

It’s worth the risk, according to William Piermattei, the managing director of the Environmental Law Program at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. He told The New York Times that environmentalists had no choice but to file the lawsuit and act on the public’s behalf.

Environmentalists “must challenge this,” Piermattei said. If they didn’t, they’d be “agreeing that we should not regulate greenhouse gasses under the Clean Air Act, full stop.” He suggested that “a majority of the public, does not agree with that statement at all.”

Since 2010, the EPA has found that the scientific basis for concluding that “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and welfare of current and future US generations is robust, voluminous, and compelling.” And since then, the evidence base has only grown, the groups suing said.

Trump used to seem intimidated by the “overwhelming” evidence, environmentalists have noted. During Trump’s prior term, he notably left the endangerment finding in place, perhaps expecting that the evidence was irrefutable. He’s now renewed that fight, arguing that the evidence should be set aside, so that courts can focus on whether Congress “must weigh in on ‘major questions’ that have significant political and economic implications” and serve as a check on the EPA.

In the EPA’s comments addressing public concerns about the agency ignoring evidence, the agency has already argued that evidence of climate change is “out of scope” since the EPA did not repeal the basis of the finding. Instead, the EPA claims it is merely challenging its own authority to continue to regulate the auto industry for harmful emissions, suggesting that only Congress has that authority.

The Clean Air Act “does not provide EPA statutory authority to prescribe motor vehicle emission standards for the purpose of addressing global climate change concerns,” the EPA said. “In the absence of such authority, the Endangerment Finding is not valid, and EPA cannot retain the regulations that resulted from it.”

Whether courts will agree that evidence supporting climate change is “out of scope” could determine whether the Supreme Court’s prior decision that compelled the endangerment finding is ultimately overturned. If that happens, subsequent administrations may struggle to issue a new endangerment finding to undo any potential damage. All eyes would then turn to Congress to pass a law to uphold protections.

By ignoring science, the EPA risks eroding public trust, according to Hana Vizcarra, a senior lawyer at the nonprofit Earthjustice, which is representing several groups in the litigation.

“With this action, EPA flips its mission on its head,” Vizcarra said. “It abandons its core mandate to protect human health and the environment to boost polluting industries and attempts to rewrite the law in order to do so.”

Groups appear confident that the courts will consider the science. Joanne Spalding, director of the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, noted that the early 2000s litigation from the Sierra Club brought about the original EPA protections. She vowed that the Sierra Club would continue fighting to keep them.

“People should not be forced to suffer for this administration’s blind allegiance to the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters,” Spalding said. “This shortsighted rollback is blatantly unlawful and their efforts to force this upon the American people will fail.”

Ankush Bansal, board president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, warned that courts cannot afford to ignore the evidence. The EPA’s “devastating decision” goes “against the science and testimony of countless scientists, health care professionals, and public health practitioners,” Bansal said. If upheld, the long-term consequences could seemingly bury courts in future legal battles.

“It will result in direct harm to the health of Americans throughout the country, particularly children, older adults, those with chronic illnesses, and other vulnerable populations, rural to urban, red and blue, of all races and incomes,” Bansal said. “The increased exposure to harmful pollutants and other greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel production and consumption will make America sicker, not healthier, less prosperous, not more, for generations to come.”</div>

            <h2>5 changes to know about in Apple's latest iOS, macOS, and iPadOS betas</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/5-changes-to-know-about-in-apples-latest-ios-macos-and-ipados-betas/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, Apple released the first developer betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, macOS 26.4, and its other operating systems. On Tuesday, it followed those up with public beta versions of the same updates.

Usually released around the midpoint between one major iOS release and the next, the *.4 updates to its operating system usually include a significant batch of new features and other refinements, and if the first beta is any indication, this year’s releases uphold that tradition.

A new “Playlist Playground” feature will let Apple Music subscribers generate playlists with text prompts, and native support for video podcasts is coming to the Podcasts app. The Creator Studio version of the Freeform drawing and collaboration app is also available in the 26.4 updates, allowing subscribers to access stock images from Apple’s Content Hub and to insert AI-generated images.

But we’ve spent time digging through the betas to identify some of the more below-the-surface improvements and changes that Apple is testing. Some of these changes won’t come to the public versions of the software until a later release; others may be removed or changed between now and when the 26.4 update is made available to the general public. But generally, Apple’s betas give us a good idea of what the final release will look like.

One feature that hasn’t appeared in these betas? The new “more intelligent Siri” that Apple has been promising since the iOS 18 launch in 2024. Apple delayed the feature until sometime in 2026, citing that it wasn’t meeting the company’s standards for quality and reliability.

Reports indicated that the company had been planning to make the new Siri part of the 26.4 update, but as of earlier this month, Apple has reportedly decided to push it to the 26.5 release or later; even releasing it as part of iOS 27 in the fall would technically not run afoul of the “2026” promise.

Before we begin, the standard warning about installing beta software on hardware you rely on day to day. Although these point updates are generally more stable than the major releases Apple tests in the summer and fall, they can still contain major bugs and may cause your device to behave strangely. The first beta, in particular, tends to be the roughest—more stable versions will be released in the coming weeks, and we should see the final version of the update within the next couple months.

In macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple added an on-by-default “Optimized Battery Charging” toggle to the operating system that would allow macOS to limit your battery’s charge percentage to 80 percent based on your usage and charging behavior. The idea is to limit the time your battery spends charging while full, something that can gradually reduce its capacity.

The macOS 26.4 update adds a new slider similar to the one in iOS, further allowing users to manually specify a maximum charge limit that is always observed, no matter what. It’s adjustable in 5 percent increments from 80 to 100 percent.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that limiting your charge percentage can lengthen the useful life of your battery and reduce wear, but there’s nothing that will fully prevent a battery from wearing out and losing capacity over time. It’s up to users to decide whether an immediately noticeable everyday hit to battery life is worth a slightly longer service life.

In the current macOS betas, enabling a charge limit manually doesn’t disable the Optimized Battery Charging feature the way it does in iOS. It’s unclear if this is an early bug or an intentional difference in how the feature is implemented in macOS.

Apple has been infamously slow to adopt support for the Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging protocol used by most modern Android phones. Apple-to-Apple messaging was handled using iMessage, which supports end-to-end encryption among many other features. But for many years, it stuck by the aging SMS standard for “green bubble” texting between Apple’s platforms and others, to the enduring frustration of anyone with a single Android-using friend in a group chat.

Apple finally began supporting RCS messaging for major cellular carriers in iOS 18, and has slowly expanded support to other networks in subsequent releases. But Apple’s implementation still doesn’t support end-to-end encryption, which was added to the RCS standard about a year ago.

The 26.4 update is the first to begin testing encryption for RCS messages. But as with the initial RCS rollout, Apple is moving slowly and deliberately: for now, encrypted RCS messaging only works when texting between Apple devices, and not between Apple devices and Android phones. The feature also won’t be included in the final 26.4 release—it’s only included in the betas for testing purposes, and it “will be available to customers in a future software update for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS.”

Encrypted iMessage and RCS chats will be labeled with a lock icon, much like how most web browsers label HTTPS sites.

To support encrypted messaging, Apple will jump from version 2.4 of the RCS Universal Profile to version 3.0. This should also enable support for several improvements in versions 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 of the RCS standard, including previously iMessage-exclusive things like editing and recalling messages and replying to specific messages inline.

As part of the macOS 12 Monterey/iPadOS 15 beta cycle in 2021, Apple attempted a pretty radical redesign of the Safari browser that combined your tabs and the address bar into one, with the goal of increasing the amount of viewable space on the pages you were viewing. By the time both operating systems were released to the public, Safari’s default design had more or less reverted to its previous state, but the “compact” tab view lived on as an optional view in the settings for those who liked it.

Tahoe, the Safari 26 update, and iPadOS 26 all removed that Compact view entirely, though a version of the Compact view became the default for the iPhone version of Safari. The macOS 26.4, Safari 26.4, and iPadOS 26.4 updates restore the Compact tab option to the other versions of Safari.

Originally introduced in the iOS 17.3 update, Apple’s “Stolen Device Protection” toggle for iPhones added an extra layer of security for users whose phones were stolen by people who had learned their passcodes. With Stolen Device Protection enabled, an iPhone that had been removed from “familiar locations, such as home or work” would require biometric Face ID or Touch ID authentication before accessing stored passwords and credit cards, erasing your phone, or changing Apple Account passwords. Normally, users can enter their passcodes as a fallback; Stolen Device Protection removes that fallback.

The iOS 26.4 update will make Stolen Device Protection on by default. Generally, you won’t notice a difference in how your phone behaves, but if you’re traveling or away from places where you regularly use your phone and you can’t use your passcode to access certain information, this is why.

It’s possible to switch off Stolen Device protection, but doing so requires biometric authentication, an hour-long wait, and then a second biometric authentication. (This extended wait is also required for disabling Find My, changing your phone’s passcode, or changing Touch ID and Face ID settings.)

Apple’s Rosetta 2 was a crucial support beam in the bridge from the Intel Mac era to the Apple Silicon era, enabling unmodified Intel-native apps to run on the M1 and later processors, with noticeable but manageable performance and responsiveness hits. As with the original Rosetta, it allowed Apple to execute a major CPU architecture switch while keeping it mostly invisible to Mac users, and it bought developers time to release Arm-native versions of their apps so they could take full advantage of the new chips.

But now that the transition is complete and the last Intel Macs are fading into the rearview, Apple plans to remove the translation layer from future versions of macOS, with some exceptions for games that rely on the technology.

Rosetta 2 won’t be completely removed until macOS 28, but macOS 26.4 will be the first to begin warning users about the end of Rosetta when they launch Intel-native apps. Those notifications link to an Apple support page about identifying and updating Intel-only apps to Apple Silicon-native versions (or universal binaries that support both architectures).

Apple has deployed this “adding notifications without removing functionality” approach to deprecating older apps before. Versions 10.13 and 10.14 of macOS would show users pop-ups about the end of support for 32-bit apps for a couple of years before that support was removed in macOS 10.15, for example.</div>

            <h2>Microsoft's new 10,000-year data storage medium: glass</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/microsofts-new-10000-year-data-storage-medium-glass/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Archival storage poses lots of challenges. We want media that is extremely dense and stable for centuries or more, and, ideally, doesn’t consume any energy when not being accessed. Lots of ideas have floated around—even DNA has been considered—but one of the simplest is to etch data into glass. Many forms of glass are very physically and chemically stable, and it’s relatively easy to etch things into it.

There’s been a lot of preliminary work demonstrating different aspects of a glass-based storage system. But in Wednesday’s issue of Nature, Microsoft Research announced Project Silica, a working demonstration of a system that can read and write data into small slabs of glass with a density of over a Gigabit per cubic millimeter.

We tend to think of glass as fragile, prone to shattering, and capable of flowing downward over centuries, although the last claim is a myth. Glass is a category of material, and a variety of chemicals can form glasses. With the right starting chemical, it’s possible to make a glass that is, as the researchers put it, “thermally and chemically stable and is resistant to moisture ingress, temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interference.” While it would still need to be handled in a way to minimize damage, glass provides the sort of stability we’d want for long-term storage.

Putting data into glass is as simple as etching it. But that’s been one of the challenges, as etching is typically a slow process. However, the development of femtosecond lasers—lasers that emit pulses that only last 10-15 seconds and can emit millions of them per second—can significantly cut down write times and allow etching to be focused on a very small area, increasing potential data density.

To read the data back, there are several options. We’ve already had great success using lasers to read data from optical disks, albeit slowly. But anything that can pick up the small features etched into the glass could conceivably work.

With the above considerations in mind, everything was in place on a theoretical level for Project Silica. The big question is how to put them together into a functional system. Microsoft decided that, just to be cautious, it would answer that question twice.

The difference between these two answers comes down to how an individual unit of data (called a voxel) is written to the glass. One type of voxel they tried was based on birefringence, where refraction of photons depends on their polarization. It’s possible to etch voxels into glass to create birefringence using polarized laser light, producing features smaller than the diffraction limit. In practice, this involved using one laser pulse to create an oval-shaped void, followed by a second, polarized pulse to induce birefringence. The identity of a voxel is based on the orientation of the oval; since we can resolve multiple orientations, it’s possible to save more than one bit in each voxel.

The alternative approach involves changing the magnitude of refractive effects by varying the amount of energy in the laser pulse. Again, it’s possible to discern more than two states in these voxels, allowing multiple data bits to be stored in each voxel.

Reading these in Silica involves using a microscope that can pick up differences in refractive index. (For microscopy geeks, this is a way of saying “they used phase contrast microscopy.”) The microscopy sets the limits on how many layers of voxels can be placed in a single piece of glass. During etching, the layers were separated by enough distance so only a single layer would be in the microscope’s plane of focus at a time. The etching process also incorporates symbols that allow the automated microscope system to position the lens above specific points on the glass. From there, the system slowly changes its focal plane, moving through the stack and capturing images that include different layers of voxels.

To interpret these microscope images, Microsoft used a convolutional neural network that combines data from images that are both in and near the plane of focus for a given layer of voxels. This is effective because the influence of nearby voxels changes how a given voxel appears in a subtle way that the AI system can pick up on if given enough training data.

The final piece of the puzzle is data encoding. The Silica system takes the raw bitstream of the data it’s storing and adds error correction using a low-density parity-check code (the same error correction used in 5G networks). Neighboring bits are then combined to create symbols that take advantage of the voxels’ ability to store more than one bit. Once a stream of symbols is made, it’s ready to be written to glass.

Writing remains a bottleneck in the system, so Microsoft developed hardware that can write a single glass slab with four lasers simultaneously without generating too much heat. That is enough to enable writing at 66 megabits per second, and the team behind the work thinks that it would be possible to add up to a dozen additional lasers. That may be needed, given that it’s possible to store up to 4.84TB in a single slab of glass (the slabs are 12 cm x 12 cm and 0.2 cm thick). That works out to be over 150 hours to fully write a slab.

The “up to” aspect of the storage system has to do with the density of data that’s possible with the two different ways of writing data. The method that relies on birefringence requires more optical hardware and only works in high-quality glasses, but can squeeze more voxels into the same volume, and so has a considerably higher data density. The alternative approach can only put a bit over two terabytes into the same slab of glass, but can be done with simpler hardware and can work on any sort of transparent material.

Borosilicate glass offers extreme stability; Microsoft’s accelerated aging experiments suggest the data would be stable for over 10,000 years at room temperature. That led Microsoft to declare, “Our results demonstrate that Silica could become the archival storage solution for the digital age.”

That may be overselling it just a bit. The Square Kilometer Array telescope, for example, is expected to need to archive 700 petabytes of data each year. That would mean over 140,000 glass slabs would be needed to store the data from this one telescope. Even assuming that the write speed could be boosted by adding significantly more lasers, you’d need over 600 Silica machines operating in parallel to keep up. And the Square Kilometer Array is far from the only project generating enormous amounts of data.

That said, there are some features that make Silica a great match for this sort of thing, most notably the complete absence of energy needed to preserve the data, and the fact that it can be retrieved rapidly if needed (a sharp contrast to the days needed to retrieve information from DNA, for example). Plus, I’m admittedly drawn to a system with a storage medium that looks like something right out of science fiction.

            <h2>FDA reverses surprise rejection of Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-does-u-turn-will-review-modernas-mrna-flu-shot-after-shocking-rejection/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Food and Drug Administration has reversed its shocking refusal to consider Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine for approval.

The refusal was revealed last week in a sharply worded press release from Moderna. Subsequent reporting found that the decision was made by political appointee Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration’s top vaccine regulator, who overruled a team of agency scientists and a top career official in rejecting Moderna’s application.

In an announcement Wednesday morning, Moderna said the FDA has now agreed to review its vaccine after the company held a formal (Type A) meeting with the FDA and proposed a change to the regulatory pathways used in the application.

“We appreciate the FDA’s engagement in a constructive Type A meeting and its agreement to advance our application for review,” Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO, said in the announcement. “Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America’s seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu.” The agency is expected to provide a decision on the vaccine by August 5, 2026.

Prasad’s ostensible reason for initially refusing to review the application was based not on Moderna’s vaccine, mRNA-1010, but on the established flu vaccine Moderna used for comparison in its Phase 3 trial. Moderna used licensed standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline, in the trial, which involved nearly 41,000 adults aged 50 and older. In a letter to Moderna dated February 3, Prasad said this choice “does not reflect the best-available standard of care,” and therefore the trial was not “adequate and well-controlled.”

Moderna acknowledged that FDA scientists had previously suggested that the company use a recommended high-dose flu vaccine in trial participants 65 and older. But the agency ultimately signed off on the trial design with the uniform standard dose, calling it “acceptable.” Moderna, meanwhile, agreed to add a comparison of a high-dose vaccine to some older participants and provide the FDA with additional analysis.

Agency insiders told reporters that a team of career scientists was ready to review the vaccine and held an hourlong meeting with Prasad to present the reasons for moving forward with the review. David Kaslow, a top career official responsible for reviewing vaccines, also wrote a memo detailing why the review should proceed. Prasad rejected the vaccine application anyway.

According to today’s announcement, the FDA reversed that rejection when Moderna proposed splitting the application, seeking full approval for the vaccine’s use in people aged 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval for use in people 65 and up. That latter regulatory pathway means Moderna will have to conduct an additional trial in that age group to confirm its effectiveness after it’s on the market.

Andrew Nixon, spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed the reversal to Ars Technica. “Discussions with the company led to a revised regulatory approach and an amended application, which FDA accepted,” Nixon said in a statement. “FDA will maintain its high standards during review and potential licensure stages as it does with all products.”

The FDA typically takes a levelheaded approach to working with companies, rarely making surprising decisions or rejecting applications outright. While Prasad claimed the rejection was due to the control vaccine, the move aligns with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s broader anti-vaccine agenda.

Kennedy and the allies he has installed in federal positions are particularly hostile to mRNA technology. Moderna has already lost more than $700 million in federal contracts to develop pandemic vaccines. Next month, Kennedy’s MAHA Institute is hosting an anti-vaccine event that alleges there’s a “massive epidemic of vaccine injury.” The event description claims without evidence that use of mRNA vaccines is linked to “rising rates of acute and chronic illness.”

Vaccine makers and industry investors, meanwhile, are reporting that Kennedy’s relentless anti-vaccine efforts are chilling the entire industry, with companies abandoning research and cutting jobs. In comments to The New York Times, Moderna’s president, Stephen Hoge, said, “There will be less invention, investment, and innovation in vaccines generally, across all the companies.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2017, Elon Musk signed an open letter calling on the United Nations to ban the development of autonomous weapons.

“We do not have long to act,” the letter read. “Once this Pandora’s box is opened, it will be hard to close.”

In 2018, he signed a pledge by the Future of Life Institute, agreeing that “the decision to take a human life should never be delegated to a machine” and that “we will neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons.”

But the draw of big government contracts to do exactly what he opposed back then has seemingly become too lucrative to remain ethically consistent. As Bloomberg reports, SpaceX and xAI, the latter of which was recently folded into the former, are now competing in a Pentagon contest to produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming tech.

Inside sources told Bloomberg that the Pentagon’s contest has a $100 million prize and was launched last month. The goal is to develop a drone swarm that can respond to voice commands simultaneously.

However, considering the current state of large language models, which continue to be plagued by hallucinations, it’s no wonder experts have voiced concerns about using generative AI to command lethal drones.

While coordinated movement of drones is already well-established tech, having a whole network of drones move autonomously at once in pursuit of a target has proven extremely difficult on the battlefield, per Bloomberg‘s sources.

The effort is part of the Trump administration’s Defense Autonomous Warfare Group (DAWG), and the Defense Innovation Unit, the Pentagon’s arm dedicated to tapping Silicon Valley for cutting-edge tech.

The goal is to progressively develop the concept from software to real-life testing across five separate phases.

According to Bloomberg‘s sources, the drones won’t just be used for reconnaissance, implying they will also serve offensive purposes. The human-machine interaction “will directly impact the lethality and effectiveness of these systems.”

That’s a considerable departure for SpaceX, which has previously inked government contracts for access to space and military satellites, but not weapons systems.

Musk’s xAI signed a $200 million contract with the US military for the use of its Grok chatbot and has been looking to hire engineers with security clearance.

The news comes ahead of a rumored SpaceX IPO at a record-crushing valuation of $1.25 trillion. How investors will react to Musk reversing his stance on the use of autonomous weapons systems remains to be seen.

Musk claimed earlier this month that SpaceX would “form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” following the company’s merger with xAI.

The CEO, however, made no mention of his companies’ efforts to develop drone swarms.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After being merged with Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, SpaceX is gearing up for a $1.25 trillion IPO — but since the entity is still currently private, it’s remained mostly out of reach of everyday investors.

But Powerlaw Corp, a fund that owns stakes in buzzy and not-yet-public companies including SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic, is giving retail traders an early taste of what could be in store for them. As Bloomberg reports, the $1.2 billion fund announced in a regulatory filing that it’s looking to give mom-and-pop investors a shot at buying in.

“With the pool of capital in private markets, the best companies are not choosing to go public,” Powerlaw investor and Jazz Venture Partners managing partner John Spinale told Bloomberg. “This robs the public the ability to access the high-growth firms.”

Powerlaw will act as the intermediary and charge shareholders a 2.5 percent management fee. The fund is planning for a direct listing, meaning that it will sell existing shares by current stockholders, unlike an IPO, which involves selling new shares to raise capital.

However, the fund will still need approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission before it can go ahead.

“Our investment objective is long-term capital appreciation,” the regulatory filing reads. “We seek to achieve our investment objective by investing in a concentrated portfolio of approximately 15 late-stage technology companies.”

Powerlaw’s portfolio includes six AI companies, including xAI, Perplexity, OpenAI, and Anthropic, as well as predictions market platform Kalshi, and even Palmer Luckey’s defense contractor Anduril.

“The fund reflects [parent company] Akkadian’s mission to democratize access to Silicon Valley’s premier technology investments,” the filing reads.

But taking advantage of the service could come with risks. For one, shareholders may not see immediate gains when share prices of these companies rise due to the way Powerlaw structures its trades. Closed-end funds also routinely trade at a significant premium to their actual holdings.

Information could also be hard to come by as privately traded companies like SpaceX and OpenAI aren’t required to disclose financial statements publicly. And a more prosaic possibility: these hype-fueled stocks could eventually crash for a variety of reasons.

And a similar investment platform, called Linqto, which aimed to allow accredited investors to invest in private and pre-IPO companies, filed for bankruptcy in July of last year after facing alleged security violations, further highlighting the inherent risks of trying to invest in private companies through an intermediary.

            <h2>Skeptic Builds “Havana Syndrome”-Style Device, Tests It on Himself, Suffers Grim Consequences</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the strangest stories in contemporary statecraft refuses to go away.

New reporting by the Washington Post revealed that a Norwegian government scientist has been secretly working on a pulse-energy weapon, an approximation of the fabled “Havana syndrome” gun, which may or may not even exist. Specifically, the weapon was described as a device capable of emitting powerful pulses of microwave energy.

Here’s where things get truly weird. In 2024, after the unnamed scientist had presumably produced a working unit, he became skeptical of its efficacy. So he did what any self-respecting man of science would do, and turned the weapon on himself in an attempt to demonstrate microwave weapons are harmless, WaPo reported.

The result was unfortunately pretty gnarly. Instead of proving the tech to be harmless, the weapon did what it was built to do, scrambling the man’s brain and bringing on a host of “neurological symptoms” associated with the infamous Havana syndrome, four people with knowledge of the event told WaPo.

Though the medical community has no precise working definition of Havana syndrome — preferring the term “Anomalous Health Incidents” — these fabled symptoms experienced by US and Canadian embassy staff in Havana, Cuba are said to include head or ear pain, loss of balance or dizziness, insomnia, confusion, brain fog, emotional distress, and nausea.

Never ones to waste an opportunity, the event spurred at least two separate visits from CIA and US State Department apparatchiks, according to WaPo. That may have something to do with a 2024 Department of Homeland Security operation to buy a pulsed-radio weapon for eight-figures, news of which broke earlier this year.

It’s just the latest episode in a decade-long search to link US foreign adversaries to Havana syndrome, a vague and highly-suspect charge that was once considered debunked. As far as this incident goes, anyone hoping it would reveal further insights into the geopolitical legend will be disappointed.

For one thing, WaPo‘s government sources noted that successful production of a weapon in US-allied Norway does nothing to prove that foreign adversaries are conspiring to use direct energy devices out in the open. (That’s in keeping with a 2023 report by five US intelligence agencies, which concluded it was “highly unlikely” that Havana syndrome was the result of a malicious direct-energy attack, though that hasn’t stopped hawkish politicians from claiming otherwise.)

One source poured even more cold water on the whole thing, sharing their opinion that the scientist’s symptoms don’t line up with the “classic” effects of Havana syndrome.

Still, the Norwegian incident has reinvigorated the claim that direct energy weapons are capable of inducing brain damage — whether its creators believe it or not.

            <h2>Tesla Robotaxis Crashing Vastly More Often Than Human Drivers</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ostensible point of robotaxis is that they’re supposed to be safer drivers than humans.

According to updated filings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration examined by Electrek, the Elon Musk-owned automaker has reported another five crashes involving its capital-R “Robotaxis,” for a total of 14 documented collisions since the service began operating in Austin, Texas last June.

The newly reported crashes were submitted by Tesla last month and occurred between December 2025 and January 2026. They include a collision with a fixed object at 17 miles per hour, a crash with a bus while the Robotaxi was stationary, a crash with a truck at four miles per hour, and two incidents in which the Tesla backed into a pole or tree.

Because Tesla heavily censors its crash reports, it’s impossible to get a clear idea of what happened in any of these incidents. No amount of blank ink, however, can cover the fact that the Robotaxis are getting into accidents at a high rate — a rate, Electrek calculates, that’s not only worse than its competitors, but the fallible human drivers it’s supposed to outmode.

Based on the mileage data shared in Tesla’s Q4 2025  earnings, the EV blog estimates that the Robotaxi fleet accumulated roughly 800,000 miles by mid-January. Divide that by fourteen, and that works out to a crash once every 57,000 miles. Compare that to Tesla’s Vehicle Safety Report, which claims that the average American driver experiences a minor collision every 229,000 miles, and it means the Robotaxis are crashing at a rate four times higher than human motorists.

It looks even worse when you compare Tesla’s fleet to Waymo’s, a company that Musk constantly tries to pick fights with, insisting that his self-driving cars are superior. Across over 127 million fully driverless miles, Waymo averages an accident around every 98,000 miles.

Even this already sizable gap may slightly flatter Tesla. In reality, Waymo’s fleet comprises over 2,000 robotaxis, while Tesla has less than fifty. Waymo operates in several major US cities, while Tesla is limited to a small area of just one. And though it’s been vague about how much it relies on remote teleoperation, Waymo cars are considered fully driverless, meaning there’s no human driver or safety monitor inside the vehicle. Or for that matter, outside it: Tesla reportedly resorted to having a human-driven car tail its Robotaxis to fulfill a Musk boast that the service would start giving rides with no supervisor in the cabs.

In short, Waymo and Tesla aren’t in the same league.

The new crashes weren’t the only alarming takeaway in the updated NHTSA data. Tesla also quietly revised a report for a July 2025 crash that was originally described as causing “property damage only.” Now, a new version submitted in December said that the injury severity was “Minor W/Hospitalization.” It took Tesla nearly half a year to properly report that someone was hurt by one of its cars.

The delay isn’t an isolated incident. The NHTSA previously launched an investigation into Tesla for repeatedly failing to report crashes in time, sometimes several months after the accidents occurred. It also heavily censors its reports by redacting crucial details like crash narrative under the guise of protecting “confidential business information.” The practice is legal, but shady. As Electrek notes, it’s the only robotaxi company that systematically censors these details in all of its NHTSA filings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Is the AI bubble going to burst? Will it cause the economy to go up in flames? Both analogies may be apt if you’re to believe one leading expert’s warning that the industry may be heading for a Hindenburg-style disaster.

“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Michael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, told The Guardian.

It may be hard to believe now, but before the German airship crashed in 1937, ponderously large dirigibles once seemed to represent the future of globe-spanning transportation, in an era when commercial airplanes, if you’ll permit the pun, hadn’t really taken off yet. And the Hindenburg, the largest airship in the world at the time, was the industry’s crowning achievement — as well as a propaganda vehicle for Nazi Germany.

At over 800 feet long, it wasn’t far off the length of the Titanic — another colossus whose name became synonymous with disaster — and regularly ferried dozens of passengers on Trans-Atlantic trips. All those ambitions were vaporized, however, when the ship suddenly burst into flames as it attempted a landing in New Jersey. The horrific fireball was attributed to a critical flaw: the hundreds of thousands of pounds of hydrogen it was filled with were ignited by an unfortunate spark.

The inferno was filmed, photographed and broadcasted around the world in a media frenzy that sealed the airship industry’s future. Could AI, with its over a trillion dollars of investment, head the same way? It’s not unthinkable.

“It’s the classic technology scenario,” Wooldridge told the newspaper. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”

Perhaps AI could be responsible for a catastrophic spectacle, such as a deadly software update for self-driving cars, or a bad AI-driven decision collapsing a major company, Wooldridge suggests. But his main concern are the glaring safety flaws still present in AI chatbots, despite them being widely deployed. On top of having pitifully weak guardrails and being wildly unpredictable, AI chatbots are designed to affect human-like personas and, to keep users engaged, be sycophantic.

Together, these can encourage a user’s negative thoughts and lead them down mental health spirals fraught with delusions and even full-blown breaks with reality. These episodes of so-called AI psychosis have resulted in stalking, suicide and murder. AI’s ticking time bomb isn’t a payload of combustible hydrogen, but millions of potentially psychosis-inducing conversations. OpenAI alone admitted that ChatGPT that more than half a million people were having conversations that showed signs of psychosis every week.

“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge told The Guardian. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”

If AI has a place for us in the future, it should be as cold, impartial assistants — not cloying friends that pretend to have all the answers. A shining example of this, according to Wooldridge, is how in an early episode of “Star Trek,” the Enterprise’s computer says it has “insufficient data” to answer a question (and in a voice that is robotic, not personable.)

“That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he told The Guardian. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the ‘Star Trek’ computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The real estate industry has seized on generative AI with a passion. Realtors have made extensive use of the tech, manipulating photos of properties beyond recognition by giving facades and interiors a heavy coat of AI-generated paint. Text descriptions of properties have turned into a heap of ChatGPT-generated buzzwords, devolving an already frustrating house hunt into a genuinely exasperating experience.

Making sense of what a rental apartment actually looks like in the real world has regressed into a guessing game. We’ve already come across bizarre listings of inexplicably yassified houses with smoothed-over architectural features, misplaced trees, nonsensically rearranged furniture, and mangled props.

But now, a listing for a property in the Washington, DC area has taken the cake. Renters seeking a new home in the capital made a horrifying discovery while browsing listings: what can only be described as an Eldritch horror poking her disfigured head out — from somehow both inside and outside — of a bathroom mirror.

In other words, it’s the kind of nightmarish creature only a flawed AI algorithm could’ve cooked up — and that only a time-strapped realtor could fail to notice before posting for the whole world to see.

The listing for a property in Fort Totten, a suburb in northern DC, has since been taken down from Apartments.com. Other instances of the same listing still exist on other sites, such as Redfin, but no longer include the mangled picture of what one Reddit user described as their “sleep paralysis demon.” Helpfully, the Internet Archive backed up a snapshot of the listing before it was pulled.

“Genuinely the worst possible thing to scroll past before I fall asleep,” one horrified user wrote. “That thing somehow struck raw primal fear in me at an unparalleled record high.”

The Zillow listing for the property includes what appears to be either the original or a differently edited photo of the same bathroom, suggesting the realtors may have attempted to edit out personal cosmetic items the previous renter had left behind on the vanity.

Besides the nightmarish creature, a mysterious ottoman was added to the middle of the bathroom floor, strengthening the case that an AI tool was involved.

“And then, for some reason, the AI added an uncanny valley blow-up doll reaching through the mirror for bathroom salad,” one user wrote.

Futurism has reached out to the real estate company behind the listing for comment.

It’s not even the first bathroom demon renters have come across lately. A separate Reddit user noticed what appears to be a miniaturized woman holding a smartphone disconcertingly crouched on the top of a toilet tank.

“How do you not notice the melted demon crawling out of the wall before you hit publish?” one baffled user wrote, responding to the suggestion that AI image editing tools may have been involved. “That s*** made my stomach drop.”

Whether the image — which includes a watermark for the cooperative realtor tool MLS but no indication that it was edited with AI — broke any rules before it was taken down remains unclear, as rules can vary significantly. As Giraffe360, an AI image editing tool for real estate photos, points out on its website, MLS organizations “consistently prohibit” edits that remove or alter structural elements, erase or modify views, or digitally renovate or upgrade interiors or exteriors.

“Here’s a simple test: if an edit would require physical renovation to achieve in real life, it shouldn’t be in an MLS listing photo,” the website reads.

Whether an Eldritch horror climbing out of a bathroom mirror requires a physical renovation remains unclear at best.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-taps-tata-for-100mw-ai-data-center-capacity-in-india-eyes-1gw/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has partnered with India’s Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets.

OpenAI announced on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its Stargate project, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.

The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.

The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.

An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.

Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.

N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.

In November 2025, TCS secured backing from private equity firm TPG to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.

OpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI’s recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions in engineering, medicine, and design.

OpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its existing presence in New Delhi as it deepens operations in the country. The expansion is expected to support enterprise partnerships, developer engagement, and local regulatory coordination as the company scales its footprint in India.

The announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI leaders, including Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are participating alongside Indian startups and enterprises showcasing AI applications across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.

OpenAI has been expanding its presence in India through partnerships with companies including Pine Labs, JioHotstar, Eternal, Cars24, HCLTech, PhonePe, CRED, and MakeMyTrip, as it seeks to embed its models across consumer platforms, enterprise systems and digital payments infrastructure in one of the world’s largest internet markets.

Together, the data center build-out, enterprise deployments, and expanding partner ecosystem signal OpenAI’s most comprehensive push yet to anchor advanced AI infrastructure and applications in India.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As India pitches itself as a global hub for applied artificial intelligence, OpenAI has partnered with Pine Labs to integrate AI-driven reasoning into the fintech firm’s payments stack, automating settlement and invoicing workflows in a move the companies say could help accelerate AI-led commerce in India.

The partnership will see Pine Labs embed OpenAI’s application programming interfaces — software tools that let companies plug AI into their existing systems — within its payments and commerce infrastructure, the companies said on Thursday, all with the aim of enabling AI-assisted settlement, reconciliation, and invoicing workflows.

The deal underscores OpenAI’s broader push to expand its footprint in India, one of its fastest-growing markets, as it looks to move beyond being known primarily as the maker of ChatGPT and embed its technology into education, enterprise, and infrastructure. Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to bring AI tools into higher education, betting that India’s large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.

Pine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.

For Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.

“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that’s where adoption can happen faster.”

The rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.

For OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India’s payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs’ role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.

Pine Labs says it works with more than 980,000 merchants, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.

Rau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI’s tools. “We’ve kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.

The arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.

Rau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.

Pine Labs’ interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Separately, India also began piloting consumer payments directly through AI chatbots last year.

The new announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are showcasing their latest capabilities alongside Indian startups demonstrating AI applications aimed at large-scale deployment across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/etsy-sells-secondhand-clothing-marketplace-depop-to-ebay-for-1-2b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Etsy is selling Depop, a secondhand clothing app popular with Gen Z and millennials, to eBay for $1.2 billion in cash, the company announced on Wednesday. Etsy says the deal will allow it to focus on its own marketplace.

The deal comes nearly five years after Etsy acquired Depop for $1.62 billion, at a time when secondhand clothing apps were gaining in popularity.

Founded in 2011, Depop generated approximately $1 billion in gross merchandise sales — the total value of goods sold through its platform — in 2025. In the U.S., the company saw nearly 60% year-over-year growth. As of December 31, 2025, the marketplace had seven million active buyers, nearly 90% of whom were under 34, and more than three million active sellers.

“Depop has built a trusted, social-forward marketplace with strong momentum in the pre-loved fashion category, and we are confident that as part of eBay, Depop will be even more well-positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from our scale, complementary offerings, and operational capabilities,” said eBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the press release.

The move comes as Etsy has struggled to grow its business after the pandemic-era e-commerce boom, competing with marketplaces like Temu and Shein, as well as Amazon.

The company’s year-over-year revenue grew 2.2% in 2024, down from 7.1% growth reported in 2023. Etsy is scheduled to release its 2025 earnings on Thursday.

“We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,” said Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal in the press release. “We are proud of what the Depop team has built – a truly differentiated brand and product, grounded in clear purpose and strong community – becoming one of the fastest-growing fashion resale marketplaces in the U.S. I am confident that Depop is well-positioned for its next phase of growth as part of eBay.”

The sale is the latest in a pattern of Etsy acquiring and then divesting niche online marketplaces. Etsy’s sale of Depop comes as the company has purchased and then sold other niche online marketplaces in recent years, including Brazilian e-commerce company Elo7 and musical instrument marketplace Reverb.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/hacking-conference-def-con-bans-three-people-linked-to-epstein/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Def Con, one of the largest and longest-running hacking conferences in the world, announced on Wednesday that three people linked to Jeffrey Epstein are no longer allowed to attend.

The conference justified adding Pablos Holman, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Joichi Ito to its public list of banned individuals, citing the three as appearing in the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its investigation of the late investor and convicted sex offender. Def Con also cited an article in Politico based on emails that the three exchanged with Epstein.

Joan Vollero, a spokesperson for Iozzo, told TechCrunch in a statement that Def Con’s actions are “entirely performative, given that Mr. Iozzo has barely attended the conference in the past twenty years.”

“It was a rush to judgment not based on any investigation or wrongdoing by Mr. Iozzo,” the spokesperson said.

Representatives for Def Con, Holman, and Ito did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The move to ban the three comes days after TechCrunch reported that cybersecurity conferences Black Hat and Code Blue removed Iozzo from their official review board pages, amid new and emerging revelations linking the prominent hacker, among others, to Epstein.

Iozzo is a veteran of the cybersecurity industry who is currently the founder and chief executive of identity startup SlashID. He previously served as a director at CrowdStrike after the security giant acquired his cybersecurity startup IperLane in 2017. As TechCrunch previously reported, Iozzo interacted with Epstein between 2014 and 2018, including after the Miami Herald reported new allegations that Epstein had abused dozens of women and children.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting sex from girls and registered as a sex offender in New York and Florida. In 2019, the Department of Justice accused Epstein of trafficking, exploiting, and abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein died in jail.

Iozzo previously told TechCrunch that his interactions with Epstein were “limited to business opportunities that never materialized, as well as discussion of the markets and emerging technologies,” and that he “never observed nor participated in any illegal activity or behavior.”

Prior to his startups, Iozzo was a research affiliate at MIT Media Lab, which was overseen by Ito at the time. The two appear in several Epstein emails together.

Joichi Ito was the director of the MIT Media Lab until 2019, when he resigned after it was reported that he was aware that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that he and the university had extensive personal and financial relationships with Epstein.

Holman, meanwhile, is the general partner at venture capital firm Deep Future and describes himself on his website as “a hacker, inventor & technology futurist.”

Holman was in contact with Epstein since 2010, planned to stay at one of his apartments in New York City in 2013, and tried to help Epstein hide negative online news stories about himself.

According to an email, Epstein made plans to attend Def Con along with Holman in 2013, but it’s unclear if they attended. Def Con founder Jeff Moss said that as far as he knows, “Epstein never attended.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/a-startup-called-germ-becomes-the-first-private-messenger-that-launches-directly-from-blueskys-app/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here’s something that you’ve never seen on Big Tech social platforms: The decentralized open social network Bluesky has integrated new technology from a startup called Germ Network in order to bring end-to-end encrypted (E2E) messaging to the Bluesky app. The move makes Germ DM the first private messenger that can be launched natively within the Bluesky app.

Alongside the launch, Germ is also releasing new guidance that would allow other apps built on the underlying AT Protocol that powers Bluesky to do the same thing.

The move is a notable example of how open social networking ecosystems work differently from the Big Tech platforms that dominate the space today, as new functionality and features can be developed by the community, not just by the company itself.

Bluesky announced the integration with Germ earlier this month, noting that the experimental integration will allow Germ users to add a button to their profile so others can message them on Bluesky in an E2E encrypted environment.

Meanwhile, Germ’s standalone app is also available in a public beta on iOS in North America and Europe. That app had seen thousands of downloads so far, but after the official integration announcement, daily active users jumped by 5x, the team said.

California-based Germ is a startup founded by Tessa Brown, a communications scholar who previously taught at Stanford, and Mark Xue, who worked as a privacy engineer at Apple on technologies like FaceTime and iMessage. The idea, the company previously explained to TechCrunch, was to offer an alternative to other E2E encrypted platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp that’s built on newer technologies.

Today, Germ takes advantage of Messaging Layer Security (MLS), a new standard approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the AT Protocol (or ATProto), which powers Bluesky, Skylight, and a growing number of other social apps.

Instead of requiring a user’s phone number, Germ integrates with ATProto to enable its encrypted chats. That means Germ’s messages cannot be decrypted by another service, including itself or Bluesky.

To use the new messenger, you’ll simply click on the badge on a friend’s profile on Bluesky, which opens an iOS App Clip — a lightweight, temporary app. You click “open” on this app experience and then authenticate by logging in with your ATProto handle. You can then send a message to a friend immediately. You’ll also be nudged to download the full Germ DM app, but this is optional.

If you want to add the badge to your own profile, you’ll download the Germ DM app on iOS and authenticate your Bluesky credentials there. (Note: We had to force-quit the Bluesky iOS app and restart it before the Germ badge appeared.)

The company has been building up to the official Bluesky integration for many months, starting with a private beta in August, which was launched using “magic links” shared in users’ bios. Now, users who set up Germ to work within Bluesky will receive a new badge that’s displayed on their profiles, allowing them to remove the link-in-bio option they were using before. (The links will still work, but the badge is easier and more noticeable, of course.)

Germ told TechCrunch their startup has been in conversation with the ATProto developer community, including Bluesky’s app and protocol teams, since the ATmosphere Conference in Seattle last year.

“We’ve been transparent about our planning and roadmap, and shipping our private beta in August generated valuable feedback from users and developers about the desire to replace our links in bios with native UI,” said Xue, who serves as CTO at Germ Network. “Both our team and Bluesky’s saw value in better AppView support for the Germ link.”

The changes to Bluesky’s app were led by head of product Alex Benzer, as the company was looked to experiment with implementing third-party services within Bluesky.

“Working directly with the Bluesky team has been a treat,” Brown, Germ’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “They ship fast, prioritize the user experience, and care about their users’ access to end-to-end encrypted messaging. We’re thrilled to be the first secure messenger they’ve brought natively into their app.”

While it’s true that the AT Protocol could eventually implement E2E encryption, that is not a focus today. As Bluesky protocol engineer Daniel Holms recently explained, the company has several reasons not to design a system itself.

“The reality is that E2EE is hard,” he wrote in a blog post. “And this inherent complexity isn’t something that the protocol team at Bluesky can just handle – it gets pushed out to every dev trying to build a client that works with encrypted data,” Holms said.

Xue agreed, adding, “We align with the ATProto ethos that people should be able to communicate using the apps and tools they choose. We believe that by solving the hard problems for ATProto users in safe, transparent, and user-friendly ways, they’ll continue to choose us,” he said.

Shortly after Bluesky added support for the Germ badge, another AT Protocol-based client, Blacksky, did as well.

Brown noted the team is currently focused on shipping more everyday messaging features, not on monetization. But further down the road, Germ may test paid features.

“We expect that our first paid features will be centered on the needs of prosumer power users like creators, journalists, and politicians—for example, support for multiple handles and private AI-powered screening for first messages from new connections,” she said.

            <h2>The West’s Winter Has Been a Slow-Moving Catastrophe</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you are reading this on the East Coast, congratulations on the warmer weather you’re finally getting this week. It was cold and snowy for a while there. Here in the West, we wish we’d been in your shoes. Spare a thought for the tens of millions of us who live on the other side of the continent, where a catastrophe is unfolding.

In Colorado, where I live and grew up, this winter has been especially warm and dry. Last year closed with the warmest December in the history of recordkeeping. It was 8.9 degrees warmer than the average from 1991 to 2020, and the warmest of all in a record that goes back to the late 19th century. Over this past weekend, my neighbors and my family walked with our dogs and our kids in T-shirts and shorts, because it was in the mid-60s in Colorado Springs. About 60 miles north, my family in Denver saw a new record high of 68 degrees—on February 15.

But temperatures are not the only reason this winter is a catastrophe. This year, our snowpack is among the lowest ever measured, which means it won’t be enough to fill the rivers that are born in our mountains, which feed  reservoirs and water farms from here to Los Angeles. Snow is finally coming to the mountains this week, but we still cannot avoid one of the worst water years in modern history. The West is already experiencing the worst drought we have seen in 1,200 years, as our junior senator, John Hickenlooper, reminded me in an email over the weekend. Colorado politicians have to be attuned to these dynamics: “The snowpack is pretty much as large as all of our reservoirs combined. That’s why winters like this one are so terrifying,” he wrote. Drought can mean economic disaster.

Hickenlooper, who was also the state’s governor and the mayor of Denver, is not a man given to hyperbole. It really is that dire. Unless a lot of snow falls soon, Colorado’s environment and economy will take a huge hit. Ski resorts are losing money now. In the spring, rivers that usually offer waist-high whitewater rapids and fishing pools will instead be a trickle; in the summer, farmers will lose peach crops. Hydrologists, fire scientists, and climate researchers are bracing for summer too; their spectrum of worry ranges from concern to actual panic.

“It’s as bad as you think it is,” Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, told me. On top of the ongoing, decades-long drought in the region, all of Colorado is in a snow drought too. The amount of water stored in the snowpack is the lowest it’s been at this point in winter since at least 1987, when comprehensive measurements began, he said. Going back to older records, some of which date from the Dust Bowl, the 2025–26 water year is the third-worst ever measured. In the two worse years, snowpack measured about 40 to 42 percent of average at this point in winter; this year, Colorado is sitting around 58 percent of median overall, and lower in some areas.

Climatologists say that a weak La Niña pattern in the Pacific is partly to blame, parking a high-pressure “heartbreak ridge” farther east than usual, which continually pushes moisture away from the mountains. But the abysmal snowpack is also causing a bad feedback loop, allowing the mountains to warm more than usual. The pattern could finally break this week, and “we definitely have time to make up ground,” Allie Mazurek, a climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center, told me. But she also cautioned that “at this stage, it is looking almost impossible for us to get back to an average snowpack.”

Schumacher’s predecessor, the longtime state climatologist Nolan Doesken, used to say that Colorado’s snowmelt is well behaved. Rain comes in a flash and is gone just as quickly, but we know where snow falls, where it will lie in wait, and which rivers it will feed months later. Flakes accumulate on cold ground, and when the Rockies stay cold the way they should, the snow remains for many months. And the surrounding air stays colder with snowpack than without it. This winter, temperatures are soaring 10 to 12 degrees above normal in northwestern Colorado—temperatures that region would not be seeing if the ground were covered in snow, Mazurek said.

Western water monitors use a metric called snow water equivalent, which is just what it sounds like, to estimate how much water will flow into rivers when the snow melts. Since 1987, the Snowpack Telemetry Network, SNOTEL, has measured snowpack by weighing the snow that falls at hundreds of stations across the West, including more than 100 currently active ones in Colorado. Other measurements are taken by hikers who snowshoe up to designated spots and measure the snowpack by hand. Climate scientists have been doing this for decades. Last week, the snow water equivalent in the Colorado River basin was tied for the lowest ever recorded, according to Brad Udall, a senior water scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on the Colorado River.

That snowpack forms the headwaters of rivers including the Colorado, the Rio Grande, and the Arkansas. And the Colorado River feeds the two largest reservoirs in the United States: Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Both reservoirs are critically low and have been for years: Powell is about 25 percent full, and Mead is at about 34 percent. If Powell’s water level drops another 40 or so feet, which it could this year, there won’t be enough water to generate hydroelectric power at Glen Canyon Dam. Water managers are starting to worry about “dead pool” too, in which the lake will get too low to let water flow through Glen Canyon toward Lake Mead; they are likely to reduce water flow out of Powell this year to avoid it.

In most of the Colorado River’s upper basin—in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming—water is not collected in many reservoirs; instead, it is diverted out to thousands of small locations, from streams to irrigation ditches. And “this year, there just isn’t going to be any water in these rivers. Or there will be water, but instead of 12 weeks or 16 weeks of water, it will be four weeks of water,” Udall told me. “Under western water law, people can basically completely dry these rivers up.”

This is bad timing, because Colorado and the other basin states are currently failing to renegotiate key parts of the more-than-century-old Colorado River Compact, which expire later this year. Along with seven states, the river-management agreement includes the federal Bureau of Reclamation, 30 tribal nations, and Mexico, and controls how the river flows into and out of Lakes Powell and Mead. The states missed a major deadline on February 14, which means that the Bureau of Reclamation will instead impose its own plan—one that none of the states are likely to be happy with. In Colorado, at least, some residents are concerned that the Trump administration will punish the solidly blue state by simply giving more water to, say, Arizona, which Donald Trump won in 2024. This is far from an irrational worry. In late December, Trump vetoed funding for a pipeline, already under construction with bipartisan support, that would bring water from a reservoir to rural communities in southeastern Colorado. The fight over the Colorado River could shape up in similar fashion, pitting state against state. (In response to a request for comment, a Department of the Interior spokesperson pointed me to a press release in which Secretary Doug Burgum said that the department had “listened to every state’s perspective” and that a “fair compromise with shared responsibility remains within reach.”)

Further in the future, the effects of water reductions will spill through the western economy. Agriculture, water recreation such as fishing and river rafting, and entire mountain ecosystems—both environmental and economic—will falter. For now, though, we are worrying about our trees budding six weeks too early, and pouring buckets of water around their trunks to keep them hydrated in the warmth. We are updating our fire checklists and go bags during red-flag warnings: One went up yesterday as I was working on this story. Winter fire watches are abnormal, but we are growing all too accustomed to them. And we are checking the snow forecast every day.</div>

IQ tests are regularly recalibrated, and over the past many decades, when new subjects have taken an old test, they have almost always outscored their predecessors’ average; Grandpa’s generation might have hovered around 100, but the kids are scoring 115 … which then becomes the new 100.

This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and researchers still aren’t sure what causes it. Perhaps it’s due to more efficient education or better nutrition. The reason could be that modern environments contain more interesting stimuli or that modern gasoline no longer contains lead.

I haven’t seen anyone propose that trivia is to thank, but the growing popularity of quizzing tracks with the IQ trend line pretty well too. I think I speak for all of science when I say we shouldn’t rule it out quite yet.

And by the way, did you know that the University of Bologna is nearly a millennium old? It’s the world’s oldest university that was founded as such (at least one older university started as a madrasa), and its alumni include Copernicus, Dante, and more than one pope.

Imagine trying to write a halfway-decent poem for an assignment, and your classmate turns in the Divine Comedy. Then again, at least you’d have had a leg up on Copernicus, who probably got marked off plenty for insisting that the Earth actually orbits the sun.

Any legislation titled with a backronym is automatically suspect, and the SAVE America Act—that’s Safeguard American Voter Eligibility—is no exception. A version of the bill languished last year, but President Trump is now pressuring Senate Republicans to pass it, among his other attempts to subvert the midterm elections. Although the bill seems unlikely to become a law, it could still create chaos and confusion about the race.

The SAVE Act is relatively simple to understand: It requires that anyone wishing to vote provide documentation to prove they are a U.S. citizen. On an intuitive level, this might make sense, because noncitizens aren’t permitted to vote. But the bill is a solution in search of a problem. States already have methods of verifying citizenship, and illegal voting by noncitizens is very rare. The bill also threatens to disenfranchise eligible voters. Although some of the bill’s supporters may be sincere, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem committed a classic Kinsley gaffe on Friday, inadvertently revealing the truth of the administration’s push: It’s a ploy to help Republicans win elections.

“When it gets to Election Day,” she said at an event boosting the bill in Arizona, “we’ve been proactive to make sure that we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders to lead this country.”

Many states have enacted laws that require photo identification for voting. (Most election laws are made at the state level, though Congress has occasionally passed nationwide laws, such as the 2002 Help America Vote Act.) Studies have found that voter-ID laws have a relatively minor effect on turnout; they are generally popular with voters, but they also disproportionately affect older voters, poorer voters, and minority voters. Politicians who support them like to point out that people need ID to board a plane or buy alcohol—but neither of those is a constitutional right, and violations of alcohol laws are very common. The SAVE Act would go a step further, not only by mandating ID at the federal level but by requiring voters to present proof of citizenship, most likely a passport or a birth certificate. Noncitizen voting simply isn’t a major threat to election integrity, and it’s already punishable under existing laws. The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank that supports the law, maintains a very helpful database of election fraud. The database contains 99 instances of ineligible voting by noncitizens since 1982. For comparison, more than 150 million votes were cast for president in 2024 alone.

Experts warn that requiring proof of citizenship would shut many Americans out of the polls. Only about half of the population holds a passport. Not all Americans have access to their birth certificate, and even that would not be sufficient for, say, a woman who changed her name at marriage, who would also have to produce proof of marriage. The congressional scholar Norm Ornstein argues that given the cost of establishing proof, the SAVE Act is in effect “a poll tax, a parallel to what Jim Crow laws used to suppress black votes, which the Supreme Court ultimately outlawed.”

If the law passes, Votebeat’s Nathaniel Rakich reports, “there are serious questions about whether it’s even practically possible to implement” by the midterms. Among other problems, the law would require cross-checking state voter rolls against a federal database, also called SAVE (though in this case it stands for Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements). But ProPublica reports that the tool is a mess, often turning up inaccurate results.

All that said, the bill seems unlikely to pass. Republican Susan Collins of Maine last week became the 50th senator to back the bill, but because Democrats will filibuster, passing the bill requires 60 votes, which it doesn’t have. Some senators are demanding the end of the filibuster (or the introduction of a “talking filibuster”), but there doesn’t appear to be enough GOP support to make that happen.

Yet Trump doesn’t seem ready to accept defeat. “There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday. The president promised to issue an executive order, but he has no power to mandate voter-ID requirements—indeed, he has no control over elections, and a previous order requiring proof of citizenship to register has been partially blocked by federal courts. Trump insisted, however, that he has “searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future.” (No one seems to know what he’s talking about, and keeping expectations low is probably wise. The legal proof will surely be coming right after his health-care plan and Infrastructure Week.)

The president may just be posturing, trying to get Republicans in the Senate to act. But he has shown little interest in stopping where his legal limitations end. And he’s testing other methods of subversion: He has tried to tell states when they can accept ballots and dictate what machines they use, and he recently called for Republicans to “nationalize” elections. Many of his actions seem motivated by a cynical calculus: Even if he loses the battle to enact the SAVE Act or put it into effect via executive order, he may be able to sow doubt about the results of the elections, which he can use if his party fares poorly in November. For his purposes of subverting elections, creating uncertainty may be nearly as effective as a real policy change.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, is the sort of highly selective institution that jockeys for the unofficial title of Harvard of the South. Recently, the university’s chancellor had a new idea: What if Vanderbilt was also in San Francisco? Maybe it could become the Harvard of the West too.

Last month, Vanderbilt announced that it was acquiring the facilities of the financially insolvent California College of the Arts and would be converting the space into a new campus. Private universities have been experimenting with satellite campuses for decades. Typically, these outposts are either overseas or limited to a graduate program or two. The Vanderbilt expansion, set to open in 2027, will be different: It will include a full-blown, four-year undergraduate college, not in Abu Dhabi but in the San Francisco Design District. This new tactic, pioneered by Northeastern University a few years ago, is taking the satellite-campus concept to its logical extreme: the national-chain model of undergraduate education. If it works for Vanderbilt, other selective institutions are likely to follow—because no one really wants to be the Harvard of the South. Everyone wants to be Harvard. Perhaps the way for excellent regional schools to develop a national reputation is to set up shop around the nation.

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, David opens with a warning about President Trump’s escalating efforts to bend American institutions to his will. David explains how episodes including the Justice Department’s attempted prosecution of members of Congress, the political pressure on the Federal Reserve, and the campaign-style appeals delivered at Fort Bragg represent a systematic attempt to erode the guardrails of American democracy.

Then, David is joined by Mona Charen, a contributor at The Bulwark and longtime conservative commentator. Together, they reflect on their shared political evolution—from their early days as Reagan-era conservatives to their break with today’s Republican Party. They discuss what they believe they got right and what they got wrong, how Trump transformed the conservative movement, and why the version of conservatism they once believed in may be gone.

Finally, David discusses “My Early Beliefs,” the 1938 essay by John Maynard Keynes, and explores what Keynes’s reflections on changing one’s mind can teach us about political growth.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Mona Charen, and we will be discussing things we’ve changed our mind about since our days as young Reaganites a long, long time ago.

My book this week will be an essay on a similar theme, “My Early Beliefs,” by John Maynard Keynes, in which the great English philosopher and economist discusses how his views had changed from the early 20th century to the time in which he delivered this essay, just before the Second World War.

But before either the dialogue or the book, some thoughts about a remarkable development in the week just past. One of the defining characteristics of the Trump years has been the determination of President [Donald] Trump and the people around him to turn into instruments of presidential will federal agencies that were always thought of as more or less independent and apolitical. The Department of Justice, well, it’s part of the administration, for sure, and the attorney general is an appointee of the president. But there had always been a belief that the actions of the Department of Justice, especially the criminal-enforcement actions, were not dictated for political reasons by the president.

Well, that idea has just gone up in smoke in the Trump years. This has been the most nakedly political Department of Justice perhaps since [President] Warren Harding’s in the 1920s and maybe the most in history because of the recent event where Jeanine Pirro, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia—supposedly acting on her own but obviously acting at the command of Attorney General [Pam] Bondi, who was acting, obviously, at the command of Donald Trump—when the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia actually tried to indict six members of Congress, four of them members of the House of Representatives, two of them United States senators, for making a video urging U.S. military personnel to obey lawful orders and not to obey illegal orders, which you would think is something that would be as basic as telling the president of the United States not to take bribes. How could such a statement be controversial unless the president was taking bribes and unless the military was contemplating illegal orders? So they took offense for that reason, and they tried to prosecute members of Congress.

Now, the speech of members of Congress is protected not only by the First Amendment, like as yours and mine is, but by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution, which puts very severe limits on the ability of anybody to punish a member of Congress for something that the member of Congress said. And yet the Department of Justice tried just that. Happily, a grand jury completely rejected the charges—there was reportedly not a single member of the grand jury who took this seriously; it was unanimous rejection, an unparalleled humiliation for the Trump Justice Department. But the litigation of other attacks on those members of Congress continues.

At the same time, we saw in this past weekend a really shocking event, where President Trump traveled to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Fort Bragg is now Fort Bragg again—it was renamed, and it’s now de-renamed—and so Fort Bragg is what we will call it. And at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, a state where there’s a Senate election in 2026, a Senate election that may prove decisive for controlling the balance of the United States Senate after 2026, President Trump appeared onstage with the Republican candidate for Senate and urged military personnel to vote for that candidate.

President Donald Trump: We have another man who is running for the Senate, Michael Whatley, if here’s here—I don’t know. Michael? Michael. (Applause.) Michael, will you come here for a second, please? He’s running for the Senate. And if he gets in, you’re gonna be taken care of. If he doesn’t get in, we’re gonna be stripping the military like they always do, the Democrats.

Frum: The military is, of course, the most important apolitical institution. Presidents address the military all the time, but they are not supposed to make political speeches, rally speeches, to ask the military to vote a certain way. That’s unheard of. That’s shocking. It’s the prelude to authoritarian rule.

Now, fortunately, again, as with the rejection of the attempt to indict members of Congress for what they said, the attempt to mobilize the troops as political actors, that also looks to have fallen flat. Reporters who were present noted that the soldiers, who maybe were warned by their commanding officers, made a point of clapping for the president’s appearance, clapping when the president talked about raising their pay—well, that’s traditional—but keeping very quiet when the president made his pitch that they should vote for the president’s preferred candidate for United States Senate. But in both cases, these are mere instances of failure, not stories of the successful pushback by institutions. But there is a story from the past week that is a much happier story about institutions actually resisting.

One of the most important independent institutions in the United States government is the Federal Reserve. Again, the president appoints members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, but they are not in any way the president’s creatures. And the theory of the Federal Reserve—which is created by act of Congress, not by an action of the executive—is: The Federal Reserve makes monetary policy based on facts and realities, as best they can determine in their judgment, and not for political reasons. There have been deviations from this ideal; they’ve usually ended in catastrophe: inflations, depressions. And in recent times, the Federal Reserve has been generally regarded by all people, Republicans and Democrats, as setting a model of independence.

President Trump has now made some new appointments to the Federal Reserve. He’s appointed a new chairman to replace Jerome Powell, the existing chairman; Powell’s term expires in May, and President Trump has put forward a nominee. But not content with simply replacing Powell, which, of course, is his right as Powell’s term expires, President Trump has tried to put pressure on Powell to cut interest rates by bringing up all incredible things or by preparing to bring—it’s not filed yet—a criminal investigation of Powell for some series of nonsense charges. Now, the charges aren’t filed, but the president has been huffing and puffing and the Department of Justice has been subpoenaing Powell as if these actions were ready.

And at the same time, he has brought forward a successor—[Kevin] Warsh looks like a solid B, maybe a B-plus nominee. He looks a little partisan. That is, he’s a Republican, of course, and in Democratic terms, he’s always calling for higher interest rates; in Republican terms, he calls for lower interest rates. He seems to be much more a creature of politics than an ideal Fed chairman should be. But he’s obviously an intelligent person, he’s got some knowledge and experience, and he’s not the cringing sycophant that some of the other candidates for the job that Trump might have chosen were. So in a pretty unimpressive Westminster dog show, he may be the least mangy poodle, so fine; pick [Kevin] Warsh.

But Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is outgoing, has said, I am not going to consider any nominee by the president, meritorious or not, unless we end these full prosecutions, these sinister prosecutions, that Trump has instituted against one Federal Reserve governor already, Lisa Cook, and is threatening against another, Jerome Powell, because they wouldn’t cut interest rates as fast as he wanted. Until these prosecutions are at an end, no consideration of any nominee whatsoever. And because of the closely balanced nature of the Senate and the rules of the Senate, Tillis may be able to make this stick. And if he is joined by other United States senators, then there’s a real trial of strength to say, The president cannot treat the Federal Reserve as an instrument of his vengeance and policy and his crass ambitions to cut interest rates and try to get some inflationary juice into the economy before the election of 2026. No one will be considered until the prosecutions are ended.

That’s more than just a defeat; that is institutional counterpoise against the attempt by the president to corrupt institutions. He has successfully corrupted the Department of Justice. He’s trying to corrupt the military, so far with minimal success, but things may get worse. And he is attempting against the Federal Reserve. In the Federal Reserve case, there is resistance, and Senator Tillis is doing exactly the right thing, and let us hope that more senators join him: absolutely no consideration of any Trump nominee to the Federal Reserve until this menace against the existing governors is completely dropped, quashed, withdrawn, defeated, given up, abandoned, sealed forever—only then.

And the irony, of course, is that if President Trump doesn’t do this and the Senate continues not to act, Powell’s term continues. He remains as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors even if he’s not chairman. He will stay on the Board of Governors, and the Board of Governors can at that point elect its own acting chairman, and it may still be Powell. So the punishment for Trump’s attempt to pervert the Federal Reserve may be getting more of what he doesn’t like, which would be a fit irony. But the best outcome: End this nonsense. Ideally, replace Bondi with an attorney general with some integrity, but failing even that, just end these shameless prosecutions, end these shameless acts of intimidation, drop the cases, close them, and then let the Senate consider the Warsh nomination on its merits, such as they are.

Frum: Mona Charen is a contributor and podcaster at The Bulwark. A graduate of Barnard, she began her career in journalism at National Review. During the Reagan administration, she served as Nancy Reagan’s speechwriter. She was a panelist on CNN’s Capital Gang in the 1990s and is the author of four books, most recently, Hard Right: The GOP’s Drift Toward Extremism, published in 2023. She was an early and prominent leader of the Never Trump movement and stayed that way. Mona was also one of the very first people to welcome my wife and me to Washington when we arrived in the 1990s, so it’s a double pleasure to welcome her today on The David Frum Show. Mona, thank you for joining.

Mona Charen: So glad to do so. David, you guys improved Washington immensely. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) All right, so let me ask you, for the benefit of those whose memory has lapsed or who were maybe born more recently than some of us—

Charen: A lot of people were born more recently than we. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Would you mind recapitulating your political journey, from the start until Donald Trump appeared on the scene a decade ago?

Charen: Well, I don’t wanna bore people too much, but I became interested in politics out of a sense of gratitude. My family came to this country at the turn of the century—turn of the last century, I should say. And I became aware at a young age of what had happened to Jews who were left behind in the communities from which my grandparents had fled and understood that this was political in nature. And so when I was in my adolescence, not something I recommend as a fun way to spend your teenage years, but I sort of immersed myself in Holocaust studies and trying to make sense of how human beings could have done that. And the result was that it made me very, very grateful for the institutions, the stability, the human-rights protections that the United States affords, and so that kind of made me a conservative. Some people have said the primary emotional response of a conservative is gratitude, whereas the primary emotional response of a liberal is dissatisfaction, wanting to improve things.

And so I became interested in reading conservative writings. I also was highly aware that totalitarianism wasn’t just a phenomenon of the right, with the Nazis and the fascists, but that the communists were just as bad, or almost as bad, I would say. And so I was an anti-communist from a young age as well, became a conservative, began reading Bill Buckley in my local paper, and then reading National Review, then began to read other conservative thinkers. I was very drawn to Edmund Burke because he was—it spoke to me, right? He was a gradualist. He didn’t want any abrupt changes that he saw as dangerous and possibly contributing to despotism. And so that’s how I became a conservative, and I stayed that way for a very long time. And I was a conservative columnist and speaker and all of that—pundit. But with the rise of Trump, I saw the destruction of pretty much everything that—

Frum: —I want to take the story up to 2016 and then slow down. I wanna go fast through the—

Frum: So where were you in the election of 2012?

Charen: I felt that [Barack] Obama was a bad president. I didn’t agree with a lot of the things that he did. I liked that Romney—I remember when Romney was asked which industries the U.S. should be backing as the industries of the future and he said, I don’t know. And he said, And no one else knows either. I loved that. (Laughs.) That kind of modesty about what government can do or know, I liked all of that, so.

Frum: So you were on board with the conservative program into the second Obama term.

Frum: When Donald Trump declared for president on that June day in 2015, did you take it seriously?

Charen: No, not a bit. And I remember, I think it was the Huffington Post said that they were going to only cover him in their entertainment coverage, not in their political coverage, and I thought that was about right.

Frum: At what point did you decide or accept that this might be a real thing?

Charen: When he continued to dominate the polls, when I saw that even the grotesque—there are a few things that stand out, of course, but the threatening violence against protesters at his rallies, mocking a handicapped reporter, scorning John McCain’s heroism—all of those things that I thought would have disqualified him obviously didn’t, and I began to worry. And then I remember, the primaries in 2015 really gave me chills that—or I guess it would have been 2016 by then—

Frum: So this is a very full buffet, and you can have more than one serving and make more than one trip. But as I hear you talking about your reaction, you are emphasizing, in the first trip to the buffet, the human qualities of Donald Trump. As you’re describing it here, that was the first reaction, the first repulsion.

Frum: And how did the rest follow? Because you start with a human reaction, but since then, you’ve had, as we’ll continue to discuss, a pretty dramatic political evolution. But you started with a human response, that this human being was violent and disgusting.

Charen: Yes, but he was also the antithesis of what I regarded as conservative virtues. So for example, he encouraged people to believe that he personally, through force of will, could solve huge problems that face us as a country. I thought that was the antithesis of everything that conservatism believed; it was Caesarism.

And then, of course, all of his various heresies, like his attacks on free trade and his racism, which, again, I thought was the fulfillment of every fever dream of the left that thought conservatives were all racists underneath, that if you scratched them, you’d find that they were really racist. And here, along comes Trump, who confirms this. So I resented that as well.

Frum: You were one of the contributors to the 2016 Never Trump special issue of National Review. I recently went back and looked at that. There about two dozen contributors. Some stayed true to their original position. Some flipped. Some have just become kind of shifty. (Laughs.)

Frum: But was that a moment where you still regarded yourself as a member in good standing of the conservative community?

Charen: Oh, boy, that feels like a lifetime ago, but at the time, we still believed, I guess, naively, that National Review had the kind of authority within the movement that we could speak ex cathedra and anathematize Donald Trump, and that people would take that seriously and they would say, Well, look at all these conservatives of long standing, who have stature within the movement, and therefore, if they say he’s not good, then that will be crippling for—I don’t know if we quite thought it’d be crippling, but we did think we had influence, and we didn’t.

Frum: Well, and I should stress that that issue was published, I believe, in January of 2016, so before any Republican primaries. Conservatives had the memory that, in 2012, there had been a lot of wacky novelty candidates who rose in the polls.

Frum: Date Michele Bachmann; marry Mitt Romney.

Frum: And I think a lot of people in January 2016 thought, That’s going to be the pattern here again.

Frum: Date Donald Trump; marry Marco Rubio.

Charen: Yep, that’s right. Herman Cain—yeah, there were a bunch of them—and Ben Carson, of course, also ran in 2016, and I thought he was similar. And I remember discussing this with other people in 2012, that it was a little dismaying to see what was happening in the primaries and saying, The base has some appetites here that are a little worrisome. And in the end, they settled on Romney, but it was a tell that they were flirting with all those other sort of crazy candidates.

Frum: All right, so where were you on Election Night 2016? Do you remember?

Charen: I should have been. (Laughs.) Yeah, no, I was at my computer live-blogging and live-tweeting and all that, yeah.

Frum: So when do you internalize that there may be a bigger set of issues here than just the human reaction to Donald Trump, that he’s speaking to somebody, and he’s speaking to a lot of people, and he’s speaking to a lot of people that you knew and trusted, and not just the famous base but to peers and friends of yours? How does that dawn begin to rise?

Charen: Well, [National Review editor] Jonah Goldberg put it best many, years ago where he had an article where he said it was watching people that he knew and believed he understood gradually become Trumpy was like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where people, they just were absorbed into this thing. And so I watched one after another, and for a long time, it was a subject of grief for me that I watched these people that I respected bend the knee. It was an ongoing process that took years, and during that time, unfortunately, I lost many friends.

Frum: So Jonah Goldberg, whom you know well and I know, I think, less well, but I know, he would say—and I’m not going to gainsay this, although I think these statements can’t ever be fully true—but he would say, I haven’t changed my mind. I’ve stayed here, and the world has moved, but I’ve been constant. I certainly wouldn’t make that claim for myself. In fact, I’ve changed my mind about a lot of things, some of them in reaction to Donald Trump, some of them in reaction to other things. Where would you situate yourself in that spectrum of saying, I’ve stayed put; the world has moved, and my statement: The world moved, and I moved with it and against it, but I moved too.

Charen: So there did come a point after the initial shock and grief where I was actually not quite grateful, but at least appreciative of the fact that, in my 60s, because of the changing nature of American life, I was forced to reevaluate many things and see it through new eyes and including looking back at my own beliefs and possibly changing my mind on things. And I felt, in a way—I wouldn’t have chosen it, but I did feel like it was a bit of a gift because at our stage of life, people mostly get stuck and rigid, and so I was forced to be a little bit more flexible, and I’ve changed my mind about many things. Look, there are certain things that I still believe and have always believed, but I find myself without a political party that also believes those things, so.

Frum: I’m gonna give you, then, in a moment, an inventory of things you’ve changed your mind about and things you have not.

Frum: You decide which of those inventories you’d like to catalog first.

Charen: So one big thing is I’ve always been interested in race relations and racial progress in America. If I go back on my work over the decades, I wrote a lot about school choice and about school reform and about family formation and other things where I felt that those were the areas to focus on to lift up African Americans, who lag behind whites and Hispanics on many social indexes. But part of my focus was a belief that the worst days of racism were really behind us, that only really kooks and fringe figures were still, like, old-fashioned racists in America, and that the new problems were things like the teachers’ unions were too powerful and didn’t allow school experimentation and reform, and family structure was a problem in the Black community—of course, in all communities, but it started in the Black community, with family breakup—and that we needed to focus more on building up family structure because that was so important for people’s success.

And what I saw in the last 10 years showed me that I had underestimated the degree to which the naked racism that had been part of American history, and which I was very familiar with but did not think persisted to this day, I now think that was wrong, that there is a tremendous amount of it and that it was naive of me to believe that we had conquered it. So that’s one thing.

Frum: Where are the things that you feel like, I’m still the same as ever; I still believe these things?

Charen: So I still believe that free markets are the best approach to many public-policy challenges. I still believe passionately in free trade. Looking for a party. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Yes, that is the issue where there was the most continuity between Trump 1 and [President Joe] Biden and now Trump 2, wasn’t it, that—

Frum: I had the recent experience of talking to a group of important Democrats and saying, I just want you all to repeat after me the words free trade.

Frum: They just can’t. Free and fair trade—no, no. No, no: free trade.

Frum: Can’t do it. And say, “Tariffs are bad.” And they say, Well, I’m against dumb tariffs.

Frum: I say, As opposed to smart tariffs? There are smart tariffs? For ideological reasons, for interest-group reasons, it’s very hard for—and there’s a lot of this—if we do move beyond Trump, I worry how much the next president, if there is a free and fair election in ’28, how much will the next president unravel, considering how little of the tariffs of Trump 1 Biden unraveled?

Charen: Yeah, agreed. So that’s one. Similarly, I continue to believe in market-oriented solutions to climate change. I think that the idea of creating prizes for new technology or all these kinds of things that economists have taught us are effective, that’s the direction that I would go. I’m afraid, again, there’s no constituency for that.

Let’s see. Fiscal discipline, worry about the debt—again, no party. (Laughs.) But more deeply, I am a believer in tradition and procedure and law and respect for tradition, so that’s one of the things that I find most horrifying about this populist era that we’re in, is that, going back to our earlier conversation about why I became a conservative, it’s the institutions, the procedures, the protections in law that it took hundreds and hundreds of years to enshrine in our system are critical, and so the idea that President Trump is now running roughshod over law and has allies aplenty in the MAGA movement who are ready—in his first term, he was trying to do it pretty much by himself; now he has eager allies. They’re destroying our system of justice and civil liberties in this country, and they’re destroying our international posture. And maybe I should mention, as that’s another thing I still believe in, I still believe the United States should be the leader of the free world, should have alliances, should stand up for countries that are invaded by aggressive neighbors, rather than finding common cause with their oppressors.

Frum: You put your finger there on something that I’ve really been wrestling with a lot, and I recently had this conversation with David Brooks, so let me raise it again with you. And I don’t have yet a developed view on this—I think about it all the time, so I don’t wanna be glib and pretend this is an easy question, and at the end of it, if you were to turn the tables, I wouldn’t know what to answer. So that said, there is a big part of me that wishes that [Attorney General] Merrick Garland and Joe Biden were right in their first-term approach, which is: Donald Trump was this unfortunate error that the American people made. They’d had a pretty good track record of picking presidents to that point; they got one wrong. The Electoral College was maybe to blame. And the thing to do was just to tidy up the mess and move on with as little recrimination and backward-looking as possible.

There is another view, which is: That failed, that Trump came back. As he often said of himself, “I became worse”; he did. The people around him became even worse than that. And we have now a full-throated attack on every American institution, the abuse of law, and it’s not clear to me you can just dust this off and tidy up and move forward without serious backward-looking and accountability. I wrestle with that question. Do you have any guidance to offer, or are you as stuck in the predicament as I am?

Charen: So I guess what you’re describing is lustration. And I think, in order to get to that point, you have to be more advanced than we are. We are still too divided and polarized to even begin to grapple with “How do we fix and put back together what’s been destroyed?” So part of the problem with the Merrick Garland thing was, and the whole approach—the people who said, Trump is a criminal, and we have to prosecute him, and they believed very firmly in the justice of that, and I understand it, but at the same time, it was done badly, I think, because that New York case really was politically motivated, and it’s the one case that they got. But it allowed the MAGA forces to say, You see? Both sides abused the judicial system for political ends, and therefore, when we do it, it’s just what was done to us. This is just payback. And so that’s a risk when you decide to use the justice system that way.

I hope that there will come a time when there’s enough recognition across party lines that we’ve gone off the rails that there will be an openness to a true accounting. There are people who are committing real crimes, including the president of the United States right now. The blowing up people in boats who you just suspect may be drug traffickers is a prime example. But it’s gonna take time and a huge amount of persuasion, and more than the persuasion, it’s gonna take more experience of the awfulness for the American people to get to the point where they’re ready for an accounting.

Frum: Let me go back to the very beginning and raise something, and this is something I think we share. I think we both came to conservatism in great part because of our Jewish identity, because of our inheritance of mass murder of the Jewish people in Europe. In my case, it was almost all of my father’s family came out and they lived, and the vast majority of his family who were left behind, they died. And had my father’s parents made a slightly different decision in 1930, my father would have been murdered at about the time of his ninth, 10th, or 11th birthday. So that’s the starting point, I think, of both of our politics: We come to conservatism by our Jewishness.

The Trump presidency has raised some very special questions, very haunting questions for American Jews. On the one hand, as you say, it’s a highly bigoted presidency, a highly chauvinist presidency, and Trump certainly has won the support of people who are increasingly not only outspoken, but flamboyantly anti-Semitic. At the same time, Donald Trump acted to support Israel, to win a much more decisive outcome in the Gaza war than the Biden presidency or a Kamala Harris presidency. And he’s acted against the Iranian nuclear program, which is an existential genocidal threat to the half the Jewish people who live in Israel.

Most American Jews are opposed to the Trump presidency, but many of the most active and prominent American Jews are quite passionately in support of his presidency for the reasons I mentioned and for others as well. How do you, as someone who, as you said, began your political journey because of this Jewish inheritance, how do you make sense of Trump as a Jewish woman?

Charen: My feeling about this is—there are a couple. One is that there is a tendency all too common to say, Well, whatever else he may be, at least he’s good for my group. And that is not a principled position to take, in my opinion, but also, I think it misses the bigger importance of what his destructiveness means for the Jewish people, among many others, because he is destroying the United States as a bulwark of free nations and a strong alliance. And so even though for now, he has taken positions that seem to please the [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government and supporters of Israel, first of all, he’s for sale, so who knows if that will last. It’s never about his true beliefs; it’s always about what’s good for him, and certainly, there are many people on the planet who have a lot more to offer him in that regard than the Jews do, so who knows how long that would last. But also, a secure Israel and a secure Jewish people depend on moral and principled leadership of the United States.

So let’s leave Israel aside for just a second. What Trump is doing to poison the social conversation here at home, to allow in these voices, to really mainstream people like Nick Fuentes and Tucker Carlson, that is deeply frightening. That’s where we live. (Laughs.) And it is opening the door to the kind of—there’s a lot of left-wing anti-Semitism, but frankly, the right-wing variety still scares me a little more because it is truly Nazi-like in its ferocity against Jews.

Frum: Yeah. Let me push back on that just a little, and again, I say this in a spirit of uncertainty, not in the spirit of argument. So the polls look pretty bad for Trump and his party at the moment that we speak. Who knows whether that will continue. Who knows whether Trump will try to find some way, by fraud or by force, to seek a third term. He says so, and I think by now, we should take those warnings seriously, although the body does fail us all in the end. Trump’s running mate and the presumptive front-runner for the 2028 Republican nomination, assuming there’s still a Constitution in 2028, is J. D. Vance, who’s very close to Tucker Carlson, and I will argue this with some of my more, again, Israel-oriented Republican friends, but I think is clearly not a friend to either the Jewish state or the Jewish people.

On the other hand, assuming there is an election and J. D. Vance is the Republican nominee, he will be running against a nominee from a party that just vetoed the most plausible-looking running mate for Kamala Harris because he was Jewish and because he wouldn’t renounce his support for Israel and wouldn’t hedge his condemnation of anti-Semitic outbursts on American college campuses, and where important voices in that party are saying that the test, their most important test for their support in 2028 is Holocaust inversion, that they are looking for a nominee who will say that the perpetrators of the attempted annihilation of Israel on October 7, 2023, that those attempted perpetrators were the victims of a Nazi-like genocide and the victims, who fought back in self-defense, they were the Nazis who committed a genocide. And that’s, for important parts of the Democratic Party, going to be the litmus test for their candidate in 2028.

It’s great that everyone’s so interested in the Jews as the Issue One. (Laughs.) I sometimes wonder, Why did we have to be so fascinating?

Charen: (Laughs.) You know that old saying—there are only two kinds of people in the world who are fascinated by Jews: Jews and anti-Semites. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Well, yeah, but it turns out that, well, a lot of people are fascinated by Jews. So how do you make sense of this, is [the fact] that you may, given life and health and the continued existence of the United States Constitution, may be called upon next time to make a choice between someone who is backed by domestic anti-Semitism and someone who won their nomination by making some kind of deal or arrangement or truce with those who do Holocaust inversion against the Jewish state and the Jewish people?

Charen: Yeah. It’s a very, very difficult time for the Jewish people, honestly. I think we were born at a time after the Holocaust when anti-Semitism was at epic low rates because of the Holocaust, and that is over. Our children and grandchildren will not be living in that world; they’ll be living in a world where it’s come roaring back. And you’re right—the problem on the left is considerable, but it’s untested as of now. So we know that the anti-Semites are very close to power on the Republican side. As you say, J. D. Vance is very close to Tucker Carlson, and Candace Owens is a huge influencer, and all of that. On the left, it is, for now, the precinct of the hard-left progressives. It’s untested as to whether that will become the dominant strain in the Democratic Party. We’ll see. That would be very, very worrisome.

Frum: Let me, as we wind up, take you back to the beginning and ask you, as you look back on the political views you had in the earlier part of your life, do you now feel regret or do you feel like, I got benefit from it even if I don’t hold to all of it these days?

Charen: Got benefit from what—from the views?

Frum: The things I believed between age 20 and age 40, I regret those things, or I don’t regret them, because I couldn’t be where I am and, in fact, there’s some value to them.

Charen: No, there are certain things that I am proud of from that period. I was a firm anti-communist. I think it’s a great boon to humanity that communism is largely a thing of history now. And there are many other issues that I think conservatives were right about. But the world has changed. The conservatism that I signed up for is completely gone. There’s no coherent set of ideas that is held by a movement, far less a party, now that is recognizable.

Frum: Yeah, again, I may be projecting my own thoughts onto you. This is a question I’ve been wrestling with a lot; I’ve been thinking about this. I’ve been working on a memoir for a long time, and I’ve been wrestling with these questions, that there are things that, when I look back on the world of my early political views, things that I thought were important, that were the defining thing—as you say, anti-communism, free markets, free trade. And that turned out to be something I cared about but that most of the people I was associated with, turned out, they never cared about it very much at all. And then [there were] other things that I dismissed as irritating or awkward or embarrassing or marginal paranoias and bigotries and conspiracism, and that turned out to be really important to a lot of the people I was formerly associated with.

On the other hand, I do sometimes think that the reason for the prominence of the Never Trump Republicans in the anti-Trump coalition is not just their novelty value; I mean, everyone likes a conversion story. But also, I think there’s something important that we bring, and that is a sense of that this is a group that has a unique sense of the uniqueness of what is happening now. And I’m sure you’ve seen often in the comments you get from readers or viewers or listeners, they’ll say something [like], Aha, we warned you that the moment Dwight Eisenhower beat Adlai Stevenson, Trump was the inevitable outcome—

Frum: No, he’s not the inevitable outcome of Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush and George W. He’s different. And we’re here to tell you that as people who liked all those people. He’s different. And because we liked all those people, we can tell you how and why he’s different in a way that the typical commenter who’s blaming Dwight Eisenhower for being the start of Donald Trump can’t tell you.

Charen: Well, yeah, the people who are kind of—and I’ll say this—I think they’re kind of smug, and they say, This was always conservatism, and this is just the full flowering of all the things that conservatism always was. I say that is absolutely not the case. One thing that pops right into my head, for example: David Duke ran for governor of Louisiana. The president of the United States at the time was George H. W. Bush. He said, We want no part of him, even if he’s a Republican, even if he gets the Republican—that’s not who we are, etc. That was just normal, that the party would, and the movement would, reject that kind of thing. Today? They’d say, He’s anti-woke—

Frum: Make him the head of the Department of Homeland Security! (Laughs.)

Frum: He’s got the mission. (Laughs.) And he’s got a lot of guys who’d make perfect recruits for our new paramilitary force. (Laughs.)

Charen: Exactly, he can start making those videos for ICE. Yeah, no, it’s really sad and pathetic, but anyway. But that is different, and we’re here to report that we lived through it and we would not have tolerated that kind of thing. We left when this became the party. So it obviously wasn’t the party in 2000.

Frum: Yeah. Are there realistic circumstances where you can see yourself reimagining yourself as a Republican and a conservative again—obviously, there are fantastical circumstances, but realistic circumstances where you can imagine yourself feeling at home again?

Charen: Not until this whole generation dies off, and since I’m gonna die off before they do, no.

Charen: (Laughs.) Because the Republican Party and the conservative movement have both been so deeply corrupted. And so, no, I cannot imagine. There is an argument that, in the 1970s and 1980s, when the neoconservatives, who had all been Democrats—some of them remained Democrats—but when they moved toward the Republican Party, they brought with them a way of thinking and ideas that were incredibly rejuvenating for conservatism. And possibly, the migration of some former conservatives into the Democratic Party can do the same thing? That’s maybe a little bit fanciful, but I hope so.

Frum: And if you were to say, what are the gifts? What are the things that they might bring with them, like the magi?

Charen: (Laughs.) The appreciation—so I’ll tell you one quick story, if I can. I was at a meeting with a bunch of people who spanned the spectrum but leaned heavily to the left, and we were talking about how elections are run in this country. And before the advent of Trump, there were a lot of liberal reform bills and things that wanted to centralize the way we run elections in this country and limit the power of states to control it. And so I remember chatting with this person. I said, The fact that the Constitution gives this power to the states looks pretty good right now, doesn’t it? And he said, Yeah. (Laughs.) So some of those limitations on what government power can do, which are sort of our birthright as conservatives—we’re suspicious of government power. Unlike liberals, who always think only of what good it can do, we’re very imbued with, No, it can also be really, really dangerous. So maybe we bring a little bit of that perspective to policy making.

Frum: Tell us at the end, finally, about the work you’re doing now. What are the things that, in your personal work, you think are important, that get you up in the morning?

Charen: Well, sometimes it’s hard to get up in the morning because the news is really depressing. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Okay, so while you’re there, in bed, pulling the covers over your head and thinking, Maybe this was all a terrible dream, the voice of conscience that says, No, you have to get out and doing, what is that voice reminding you of?

Charen: It is remembering how important—just [George] Orwell’s line about It’s the duty of intelligent men to state the obvious, keep saying it, being unafraid to say the things that a lot of people in mainstream media and, certainly, in the business world and in many of our institutions, people are afraid to be honest and tell the truth. And so those of us who have been foolish enough to lose all our friends by telling the truth in the past can continue to tell the truth as we see it, and maybe that still has value. (Laughs.)

Frum: Mona Charen, thank you so much for joining me today on The David Frum Show.

Frum: Thanks so much to Mona Charen for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As mentioned at the top, my book this week is actually an essay, “My Early Beliefs,” by the great English economist John Maynard Keynes. Since Mona and I spent so much time discussing our own political evolution, I thought it might be interesting to turn to what is maybe the most famous such discussion ever written, and that is Keynes’s essay, which he delivered as an after-dinner speech in 1938.

Keynes graduated from Cambridge in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1938, he and a group of his Cambridge friends gathered together for a dinner to look back on the changes in their lives over the past third of a century. Keynes delivered this paper talking about the way that he and his friends had changed their minds about important issues. In the last bit of this essay, which is only 13 pages long, Keynes reflects on one of the important shocks that came to him and came to his friends since their undergraduate days.

Now, the early part of the 20th century was, if you were an Englishman of bourgeois background, as Keynes was and as his friends were, a time of extraordinary security. Those of you who have recently watched on your own or with children the Mary Poppins movie will remember George Banks, the patriarch banker, singing, “It’s [grand] to be an Englishman in 1910.” And so, if you came from John Maynard Keynes’s background, so it was; it was good to be an Englishman in 1910 or 1904 or ’05, when Keynes was at Cambridge.

But in the interval between their undergraduate days and 1938, when the essay was delivered as an after-dinner speech, in that interval, the world had passed through the First World War, the Communist revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, the rise of fascism, inflations, depressions, and was now, in 1938, on the edge, very visibly, of a second and even more terrible world war. The age of security that Keynes had grown up in was gone forever, and a lot of Keynes’s thinking and work in his later years dealt with the shock to the sensibility of someone raised in that secure world of Edwardian England dealing with a new world of communism, fascism, wars, inflations, depressions.

And so I wanna quote from the later part of the essay a passage that I think resonates through the ages to our time now. He’s talking about this group of friends, and he says of them, “In short, we repudiated all versions of the doctrine of original sin, of there being insane and irrational springs of wickedness in most men. We were not aware that civilization was a thin and precarious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skillfully put across and guilefully preserved. We had no respect for traditional wisdom or the restraints of custom. We lacked reverence … for [everything and everyone]. It did not occur to us to respect the extraordinary accomplishments of our predecessors [in] the ordering of life (as it now seems to me to have been) or the elaborate framework which they had devised to protect this order.”

As I look back on my early beliefs and the beliefs Mona and I discussed, I realized that Mona and I, our political evolution can be described by exactly the opposite direction. We began as young conservatives—in my case, as early as the 1970s—very aware of, as Keynes put it, that civilization was “a thin and precarious crust.” What we were not enough aware of was the flip side of that. Just as Keynes had to discover the power of order, I think Mona and I—I won’t speak for her; I’ll speak only for myself—that those of us who were conservatives then and are less conservative now, I don’t think we were aware enough that it wasn’t just order that was needed but also the justice and fairness that caused that order to be, to quote Keynes again, something a little bit more than “the personality and the will of a very few.” That the order that we valued so much gained its power because of a broad consensus based on the personality and the will of a great many, and the way to get that great many to back the order was through a sense in most people, in many people, that the order was just. And that if the order was ever felt to be unjust, unfair, to favor only that very few whom Keynes described, then it would have to be maintained in ways that were harsher and more tyrannical than the order that we valued and that we remembered.

I think we all go through evolutions in life, and that’s one of the tragic blessings or one of the blessed tragedies (laughs) of growing old is that you get this critical distance on what you thought before and what you think now. And maybe the outcome that we’re all groping to is to say, How do we hold onto things that we thought were true when we were young, that were correct intuitions when we were young, and how do we enrich them as we get older? That is the topic that Mona and I have spent our time together discussing, we’ve spent so many years of our lives working together on. I’m very glad to have had her today to discuss this working out with me on The David Frum Show.

Thanks so much to you for listening and watching The David Frum [Show]. I hope you will subscribe and share this program widely, that the success and continuation of the program depends on your subscriptions and your sharing. As always, the best way to support the work of this program, if you’re minded to do that, is by subscribing to The Atlantic, and then you can support the work not only of me but of all of my Atlantic colleagues. Thanks so much [for] joining me today on The David Frum Show. See you next week for another episode of The David Frum Show. Bye-bye.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/2026/02/nick-miroff-wins-2025-polk-award-immigration/686035/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Atlantic’s staff writer Nick Miroff is the recipient of the 2025 George Polk Award for immigration reporting for his coverage of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Miroff broke the story in March 2025 that the Trump administration had erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran prison despite his protected immigration status, and reported on developments before and after Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States.

At The Atlantic, Miroff has reported extensively on immigration and President Trump’s mass-deportation campaign, including breaking the news last month that Greg Bovino was ousted from his position as Border Patrol “commander at large”; chronicling battles raging inside the Department of Homeland Security; reporting on ICE’s status following its withdrawal from Minneapolis; revealing that more than a third of ICE recruits at the agency’s training academy in Georgia failed the ICE personal-fitness test; and co-reporting a profile of Stephen Miller, detailing how Miller acts as an accelerant for the president’s most incendiary impulses and shapes the lives of individual Americans in nearly every realm.

The George Polk Awards were established in 1949 to commemorate George Polk, a CBS correspondent murdered in 1948 while covering the Greek civil war. The awards place a premium on investigative and enterprising reporting that gains attention and achieves results, and honor special achievement in print, online, or broadcast journalism. An announcement is below from The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg:

Big news this morning: Nick Miroff has been named the winner of the 2025 George Polk Award for immigration reporting. This recognition is greatly deserved, because Nick has owned this beat like no other reporter. Working with his wonderful editor, Jenna Johnson, Nick has not only delivered scoop after scoop, but he has contextualized, deepened, and—this one is particularly important—complicated our understanding of America’s current immigration crisis. Though he is winning this award in large part for breaking the news of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia (and for his continuing coverage of that case), Nick’s stories on the internal workings of ICE and other government bureaucracies deserve equal praise.

Nick only joined us last year, but he has made himself completely integral to The Atlantic’s reporting. As you all know, he also broke the story that Greg Bovino was ousted from his position as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large”; he covered the battles raging inside DHS; he revealed that more than a third of ICE recruits at the agency’s training academy in Georgia failed the ICE personal-fitness test; and he co-reported our recent excellent profile of Stephen Miller.

The Polk Awards are among journalism’s most prestigious, and I’m so pleased to see Nick—and Jenna, and the whole team—receive this outstanding recognition.

Which was created by that woke leftist Richard Nixon. Congress and the president gave the EPA enforcement power because the EPA employs experts and scientists. What republicans want is congress to vote on every measure that the EPA used to handle. You know those well informed folks like the &quot;internet is a series of tubes&quot; fellow or the 39 year old grandma who was kicked out of a theater for vaping.

They want similar plans for every agency including the FCC. So if a radio transmitter is operating out of band and spewing harmonics, congress has to vote on the measure of fining the owner who refuses to repair it.

We live in an age of wonderfully empowered idiots. Yay computers.

Sometimes I think Plato might have had a point.... Only thing is we&#39;d just end up with some steaming fascist goon instead of a philosopher king. Kinda like democracy actually...

Somehow the mongo sb ad is even more annoying now.

How will this help them leverage their core competencies in order to holistically administrate exceptional synergy?

It&#39;s stupid.  The OEMs should fill that area with either more battery or... empty volume.

Is it stupid?  Like most people, I am ALWAYS going to use a case that protects the phone (or tablet).  The hump in a case is slightly recessed (even with a thin case), maintaining most of the protection of that area.  And the rest of the device is fully protected, making it, overall, X thin.  If they were to fill the rest of th

I actually like my camera bump-  when I put it my last phone without one on a slightly curved surface (such as the side of my bathtub) it would slide off.  With the bump, there&#39;s enough friction to prevent that.  So while ugly, that&#39;s enough of a QOL increase I&#39;d rather have the bump.

So don&#39;t buy it. In fact don&#39;t buy any phone until yours is 5 or 6 years old.

The new phone every year phase is so 6 years ago.

Engadget says it also hassatellite SOS  which is kinda neat.also has Bluetooth v6  which may offer some neat edge improvements for Airtag type stuff.  (better range and also distance)(https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10a-vs-pixel-9a-whats-changed-and-which-one-should-you-buy-150000786.html )

Also just by virtue of being a new model it&#39;ll get  1 year longer support than the old model

(apologies for posting an Engadget link... but as the web dies... well... at least it&#39;s not a FB post ...)

Faster wired charging, faster wireless charging, bluetooth 6, and a few other bits.

while dropping features like Pixelsnap Qi2 charging and advanced Gemini AI capabilities found in higher-end modelsCan&#39;t drop something you never had. The 9a definitely did not have Pixelsnap, so I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s even mentioned. It&#39;s an easy thing to omit from the &quot;budget&quot; device in the lineup.The real question would be what the new price point for the 9a would be - if they drop it at all. I&#39;d normally expect the previous gen to see a price drop, but these are overall so close in spec, I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ll bother.

The laws all favor the Rich.  The nasty feedback of Oligarchs buying politicians, and the politicians giving Oligarchs special favors and tax breaks, are in full view right now for everybody to see.That&#39;s why the strongly Left leaning grassroots of the Democratic party need to organize to kick the likes of Chuck Jeffries and Hakeem Schumer to the curb.

If you ever get a chance, find an old book &quot;The paranoid streak in american politics&quot; , or maybe it was a long form essay, cant remember, from the either late 60s or early 70s that traces the history of the paranoid wing of the Barry Goldwater campaign , namely around the John Birtch society (The original infowars paranoic conspiracy group) and the McCarthy witch-hunts..

It&#39;s even worse than that.If their AI shit actually has the sweeping impact that they seem to believe it will have, it will be Viva la revolución! and the guillotine will need to be fed.Very prudent of them to have some politicians in place that will keep feeding the culture wars, or maybe gin up an international conflict.Need to keep the proles distracted, or they&#39;ll get ideas and might show up with pitchforks at your secure Palo Alto compound.

Pretty cool they can say they&#39;re buying off politicians in the news and nobody gives a fuck

You do realize that you&#39;ve just added yet another powerful, eloquent incentive to the growing pile of such self-fulfilling prophecies upon which LLMs are feeding, right?

it is time that citizens united be finished. no one “person” (or corporation, or country) should hold so much power over the legislative body.

I assume you mean SCOTUS should reverse the decision in Citizens United vs. the Federal Election Commission [wikipedia.org] which allowed essentially unlimited PAC money in elections. And I agree, but there&#39;s not a chance in hell that the current SCOTUS will do that. So, think of something else to do.

The mere phrase &quot;election investment&quot; sounds more red flags than i can count....

What sort of a system are you guys running over there!!??

This is literally budgetting for what anywhere else is called outright bribery!

And for Meta: this is merely a cost of doing business - an expense they can subtract before taxes!

So its worth repeating: What sort of a system are you guys running over there!!?? Really?

I wonder if publicly owned companies are the problem.

An individual who owns a successful company is motivated to keep making profits. But once they reach a certain level of wealth, they often start to come over all philanthropic. This can of course be partly for show, but I think there is a genuine motivation to feel good about one&#39;s self - and providing the funding to help others is one way of doing that.

But - If this individual at some point turns their company into a publicly (shareholder) owned company, you suddenly go back to the situation where the owner(s) have mostly not reached that sufficient level of wealth, where the desire to make even more money is outweighed by the desire to make a positive impact on the world. So by going public, the individual steers away from the philanthropic path (although they might still so some of that on their own), and sticks to the continuous profit making path. Not that profit making is bad in itself, but as in the case of addictive social media, it can get in the way of doing the right thing.

It is about the design and behavior of the site/app.  The inclusion of psychologist designed dark patterns created specifically to be addictive.  This goes beyond the general business desire to have an appealing product that people want to use and into the realm of willful negligence.  They knew that certain features would trigger an addiction response in susceptible users and chose to include those features, even to make those features central to the product design.

In the end, Meta will lose, regardless of the facts or the law. They will lose because a California jury will look at the amount of money Meta has, and decide to take as much of it away as possible. I&#39;ll predict a billion dollar verdict or more, if Jesus personally came down to testify that, being God, and knowing everything about everyone, had Personally created man to not be capable of becoming addicted to Facebook. Facts simply don&#39;t matter.

The appeals will go on for years, and in the end, the only thing

How likely do you think it is that Meta was acting ethically here?  I could totally see them designing their algorithm solely to drive engagement and higher ad revenue while ignoring the negative impact on users, including high prevalence of addicitve behavior among younger users.

They could literally resurrect dead babies on live television and the jury would find against them because they have a lot of money.

This isn&#39;t a legal case. It&#39;s a political case, and facts are literally not allowed to matter.

I guess I have more faith in juries than that.  If the jury thinks the plaintiff is making stuff up to score some cash, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll find in favor of the plaintiff.

But in this case, I think it&#39;s going to be hard for Meta to look credible.  It&#39;ll still depend somewhat on how good the plaintiff&#39;s story is and how sympathetic they seem.

&quot;Robots cannot suffer addiction. Nor can we feel remorse.&quot;

Every time he gives a speech and there are comments on the video or article, someone will respond to the effect that their AI is getting much better and Zuckerberg almost passes as human this time.

That&#39;s silly. Zuckerberg is an older model and has non-upgradeable firmware.

Addiction sounds like a more plausible problem than witchcraft to most of us. The word even had a meaning, once! If you were an addict and stopped using your drug of choice, you&#39;d be facing chills, sweats, vomiting, and convulsions.

Oddly enough, that hardly ever happens when you stop using social media.

The Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that its top spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, would depart the agency after just over a year on the job. To most, McLaughlin is probably best known for slandering Americans wounded or killed by immigration agents—including Renee Good (whom she accused of “domestic terrorism”) and Alex Pretti (whom she claimed sought to “massacre law enforcement”). Inside the legal system, though, McLaughlin is known for something else: Actively sabotaging the Department of Homeland Security in court through her crass, often false public statements. Most notably, McLaughlin has gained notoriety for smearing judges who rule against the Trump administration, deriding them as “activist,” “craven,” “out of control” partisans engaged in “judicial sabotage,” “race-baiting,” and stoking “the embers of hatred.”

President Donald Trump has praised her tactics, but they have done her department no favors in front of these judges. It was perhaps inevitable that judges would bristle at a government spokeswoman deriding them as hacks. But McLaughlin did not merely alienate the judiciary; she consistently undermined the administration’s legal arguments, sabotaging lawyers’ efforts to cover up unlawful conduct by boasting about it on social media. Judges then cited these posts to refute the administration’s claims and rule against it. Few if any government spokespeople have done more to kneecap their own agency in court than McLaughlin.

The gap between this administration’s public statements and legal assertions has been a stubborn problem since Trump returned to office, but nowhere is it more chasmic than DHS. In their briefings, government lawyers finesse a sanitized version into a clean narrative of law-abiding responsibility. At hearings, they insist that the department adheres to high standards of professionalism and good-faith compliance. But McLaughlin’s confrontational declarations to the press routinely punctured this fiction. And lawyers suing DHS pointed judges toward her messaging as evidence of the agency’s real actions and policies—which were, quite often, flagrantly illegal.

Escobar Molina v. DHS illustrates this pattern perfectly. It marked a challenge to immigration agents’ widespread warrantless arrests of suspected immigrants in the District of Columbia, which seemingly targeted anyone who appeared Hispanic. The plaintiffs—lawful residents and American citizens caught up in the dragnet—sued, alleging violations of a statute that allows warrantless arrests only when agents have “probable cause” that an individual is undocumented. In court, lawyers for the department attested that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection rigorously adhered to this standard. Outside of court, however, McLaughlin kept contradicting them, asserting over and over again that immigration agents did not require probable cause to arrest a person suspected of lacking lawful status. To the contrary, she said that agents merely required “reasonable suspicion,” a much more lenient standard. This was not a one-off: McLaughlin repeated her claim over and over again, and amplified it from DHS’s official accounts.

Judge Beryl Howell was not pleased with this discrepancy. At one hearing, she ordered government lawyers to explain whether they or McLaughlin were stating the agency’s true position. The lawyers tried to dismiss McLaughlin’s comments, saying she did not “necessarily understand” “legal terms of art” because she was not a lawyer. “This,” Howell later wrote, “is a remarkable assertion.” The government seemed to be saying that McLaughlin was “ignorant or incompetent, or both.” Howell scolded the lawyers for their failure to “prevent these statements from being made in DHS’s official communications to the public.” And she concluded that McLaughlin’s statements must be “taken at face value as reflecting the current policy and practice of DHS and federal law enforcement agents making civil immigration arrests.” Howell then issued an injunction barring warrantless immigration arrests without probable cause in D.C. (The government says it will appeal her ruling but has not yet done so.)

McLaughlin also helped to botch ICE’s efforts to keep immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra-Ramirez locked up without bond. Federal agents arrested Vizguerra-Ramirez while she was on a work break from Target, just one day after she marched against Trump in a widely publicized protest. ICE boasted of the arrest online, and McLaughlin took a victory lap on X, writing: “We will find, arrest, and deport illegal aliens regardless of if they were a featured ‘Time Person of the Year.’ ” The implication seemed to be that ICE had singled out Vizguerra-Ramirez to send a message that no immigrant was safe.

The courts paid attention. Judge Nina Wang later pointed to this tweet as evidence that the administration “sought to make an example of Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez by arresting and detaining an individual with a high profile as a labor and immigration activist.” McLaughlin’s brag that the government had snagged a well-known advocate raised “unique due process concerns,” Wang wrote, and contributed to her conclusion that Vizguerra-Ramirez’s detention violated the Fifth Amendment. Wang ordered a bond hearing, and Vizguerra-Ramirez was quickly released. She remains free today and continues to challenge her order of removal.

McLaughlin’s X account has, in fact, routinely corroborated plaintiffs’ claims that DHS is violating the Constitution. In one case challenging the revocation of student visas because of anti-Israel activism, the government argued that it was merely trying to avoid “adverse foreign policy consequences,” not punishing protected speech. Judge Noël Wise didn’t buy it, pointing to McLaughlin’s insistence that those “pushing Hamas propaganda” and similar “anti-American conduct” would see their visas revoked. Wise cited McLaughlin’s warning as evidence that the government was retaliating against “expression related to Israel and Palestine,” denying the government’s motion to dismiss the case. Judge William Young also cited McLaughlin’s post in ruling that the administration had violated the First Amendment by detaining and deporting pro-Gaza activists. DHS lawyers spent many hours camouflaging their speech suppression in neutral terms, only to see McLaughlin tweet out the real—and unconstitutional—reason for the crackdown.

Sometimes McLaughlin stepped on more prosaic rakes. In a case challenging immigration agents’ excessive force against protesters, the government argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because the threat of future violence was too speculative. This contention seemed to be bolstered by a credible news report that immigration agents would imminently end the surge and, with it, the plaintiffs’ need for relief. But McLaughlin promptly refuted the report on X, writing: “We aren’t leaving Chicago.” Judge Sara Ellis then used her post to show that the threat of continued violence was all too real, granting the protesters standing.

It’s easy to see why McLaughlin believed she could undermine or contradict her agency’s official position in court without consequence. Trump posts bizarre and aggressive rants on Truth Social all the time, yet courts mostly ignore his late-night ramblings. But that’s because the Supreme Court has shied away from using a president’s public comments as proof of policy, preferring to focus on official communications like executive orders (ostensibly out of respect for the office). The rules for DHS are different: SCOTUS subjects agencies to far more scrutiny and demands that they tell the truth about their decisions. Federal courts may block agency actions that are “arbitrary and capricious,” and statements by a spokesperson can be evidence that an agency is breaking the law.

McLaughlin’s departure may therefore be bittersweet news to the many lawyers now litigating against DHS. Sure, she vilified immigrants, smeared protesters, and attacked judges. Sometimes, though, she also told the truth, in ways that were inadvertently beneficial to the targets of her ire. If she is replaced by a more disciplined spokesperson, the courts may have a more difficult time smoking out the real, lawless policies driving Trump’s mass deportation machine. McLaughlin’s comments were reliably abhorrent. But they were, with remarkable frequency, also a smoking gun.

Trump’s “Board of Peace” emerged from last year’s ceasefire negotiations to govern Gaza after the war. But since then, the board has evolved into a motley group of countries that are willing to pay a billion dollars to join a body that has Donald Trump as its chairman for life. They also have mostly stopped talking about Gaza.

Two American politicians drew top billing at this past weekend’s Munich Security Conference, where U.S. and European political leaders gather each year to mull the state of the trans-Atlantic alliance—a topic that is now teeming with suspense and peril.

The headliners were Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Europeans hoped Rubio would mollify their concerns about President Donald Trump’s commitment to the continent’s defense—or at least erase the memory of last year’s main speaker, J.D. Vance, whose unabashed hostility toward the Western alliance and firm embrace of Germany’s neo-Nazi party set off the crisis between the two continents today.

In this context, they viewed AOC as a possible harbinger of the U.S. leadership’s next generation and wondered—some with excitement, some with dread, almost everyone with curiosity, because she had never appeared at the conference before—just what her ascension might bode.

As it turned out, Rubio proved disappointing, while AOC was too vague to leave behind an outline of the alliance’s future or her chances of rising to its helm—though she expressed reassuring sentiments with (for the most part) encouraging eloquence.

Rubio received a standing ovation at the end of his keynote address on Saturday, mainly because he spoke softly and uttered a few welcome lines that the likes of Vance or, worse still, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (who did not attend the conference) would never utter—for instance, “the United States and Europe … belong together,” “We are part of one civilization,” and “Our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.”

These lines inspired his interlocutor, at the start of a Q&A period, to note “the collective sigh of relief throughout this hall” during the secretary’s “message of reassurance and partnership.”

But those listening with more jaded ears, and nearly everyone who read the transcript afterward, saw it as what might be called Vance-and-Hegseth lite—warm and friendly in tone but pure MAGA in substance, or as Politico paraphrased his message: “Join Donald Trump’s campaign to reshape the world for Washington’s benefit, or get out of the way.”

The traditions that Rubio invoked, in recalling the alliance’s past, were those of nationalism (a subtle rebuke to the European Union, an open rejection of free trade, and a dismissal of international law), Western civilization as Christian civilization (ignoring not just Judeo-Christian heritage but the roughly 25 million Muslims who live in Europe), and the “unapologetic” mission “to build a vast empire out across the globe.”

His call for alliance unity was an invitation for “you” (Europeans) to “join us” (Trump’s America) on our path. His speech—at the world’s most preeminent security conference—did not mention Russia, NATO, or China, but instead listed as the West’s biggest dangers “fear of climate change, fear of war, fear of technology,” and the “mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people.” To renew our alliance, he said, means to “restore a place in the world” that will “rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”

We’ve heard this phrase “civilizational erasure” before, from Trump himself. It translates, pretty explicitly, to Make America (and now Europe as well) White Again.

After his appearance in Munich, as if to confirm this impression, and to splash water on those who tried to interpret the speech as a beacon of hope, Rubio flew to Budapest, where he publicly embraced Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and told him, “I say to you with confidence that President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success, because this relationship we have here in central Europe through you is so essential and vital for our national interests in the years to come.”

Rubio’s wish for Orbán’s “success” should be viewed in two contexts. First, the prime minister is facing a tough election; Rubio’s words amounted to an open endorsement by Trump. Second, Orbán is universally seen as the EU’s outlier—the Union’s most outspoken critic of democracy, supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and opponent of military aid to Ukraine. In wishing for Orbán’s success, Rubio was thumbing his nose at the entire spectacle—the very purpose—of the Munich Security Conference. Basically, he was repeating, through his actions, Vance’s aggressively hostile speech last year.

If Rubio had gone to Munich after Hungary, the gist of his speech would have been grasped without illusion. Even before the speech, he gave what should have been seen as a hint of his real intentions by brushing off a meeting, which he’d been scheduled to attend, on the security of Ukraine.

Usually several members of Congress attend the Munich conference, though this time House Speaker Mike Johnson barred the funding of their flights, in anticipation of the impasse that froze the Department of Homeland Security’s budget. Still, a few made their own way, notably Sen. Lindsey Graham—who, at one session, said, “Who gives a shit who owns Greenland? I don’t.” (Too bad he couldn’t have summoned the courage to say that a month ago, when Trump threatened war over the question). A few politicians who are assumed to have presidential aspirations also managed to attend: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (who stressed the vital relations between her state and Canada), California Gov. Gavin Newsom (who proclaimed that his state still observed tight laws on greenhouse gases), and the aforementioned AOC.

AOC was the big curiosity, and the two panels where she spoke—one on populism, the other on U.S. foreign policy—were hot tickets. She had never been to the conference before. She was there to lay out a vision of an alternative, progressive foreign policy—and therein lay the mystery: What is a progressive foreign policy in the era of Trump?

A decade ago, progressives would have been, and still would be, anti-war, but would they now support NATO and the armament of Ukraine, if just to distinguish themselves from MAGA isolationists? And how would a progressive fit the U.S. into Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s assertion of “middle” nations’ power in his speech earlier this month at the Davos conference?

Before this weekend, I had never heard AOC speak at length, without a script, on foreign policy (or many other topics), and, following the panels streamed on YouTube, I found her for the most part impressive. She argued that income inequality fueled the resentment that triggered the rise of right-wing populism. She noted (as did Carney, though less pointedly) that the “rules-based order” has always excluded the poor from its benefits and the powerful from its obligations, and mused that, contrary to those who say we’re in a “post-rules-based order,” we might be in a “pre-rules-based order.” The real question, in any case, was “rules for whom.” She advocated a “working-class-centered” policy, in part for its own sake, in part to “stave off authoritarianism.” She supported firm commitment to allies, especially those that share our values on human rights and democracy, and adherence to treaties, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans had signed them.

She didn’t quite explain what a “working-class” foreign policy might entail. (President Joe Biden talked about “a foreign policy for the middle class,” tying the idea to an industrial policy that let the U.S. compete with China in high tech; it’s unclear whether AOC would go there.) Nor did she address how a commitment to alliances would affect the balance between social spending and defense spending. In that realm, she (already famously) fumbled a question on whether she’d defend Taiwan from an attack (though, in fairness, the “strategic ambiguity” of U.S. policy on that question is confusing even to seasoned experts—she just hadn’t been briefed on the proper clichés to utter).

She still needs some seasoning in this sphere, but this was her first exposure, and she’s just 36 years old. She could acquire another 30 years of seasoning and still emerge younger than Trump was the first time he ran for president.

But just as Rubio revealed his true colors on his first stop after Munich, AOC made what could turn out to be her most enduring impression after the conference as well. Rubio stood alongside Europe’s most authoritarian leader, in Budapest. AOC met and spoke with some of its most prominent left-liberal leaders, in Berlin.

She spoke first to leaders of Germany’s Social Democratic Party/SPD and then to its Left Party/Die Linke—both full-house events, mainly about leftish issues, which they had rarely heard about from an American politician, especially one as prominent as AOC.

But apart from the issues, AOC stressed the importance of sticking together. Whatever they might try to accomplish, she said at the first event, the approach “has to be coalitional.”

We have to grow our ranks … because if we go separately, we will lose it all. … Everyone has something to give here, and that’s why I’m proud to meet with Die Linke tomorrow and to be here with SPD today, because we cannot let the right win.

This was a stern message to the two groups of German politicians, who have sharp divisions, despite knowing very well that, a century ago, similar divisions between social democrats and socialists abetted the rise of Hitler. Today, SPD and Die Linke together hold 19 and 10 percent of the seats in Germany’s parliament, respectively. The far-right-wing party, the AfD, holds 24 percent. (The centrist Christian Democratic Union holds 33 percent, and the Green Party holds 13 percent.) Together, the two left-leaning parties outflank AfD; apart, they can get crushed.

AOC is pursuing the same theme back in Washington. Back in 2018, when she was first elected as a Bernie Sanders–type democratic socialist, she formed a huddle with a few like-minded House members who called themselves the Squad. Now she is a power- and coalition-builder, even helping to raise money for centrist Democrats—who ask her for help, knowing that they need her constituents to push them over the edge, just as AOC knows she needs the moderates to push her agenda.

The U.S. probably hasn’t shifted quite left enough to elect AOC president in 2028. (It’s questionable whether she could even win upstate New York in a race for the Senate.) But domestic alliances are shifting, just as global alliances are shifting. In weighing the contestants for America’s top leadership positions, it’s worth noting that Trump, Rubio, and Vance endorse Orbán and the AdF—while AOC tries to unify the SPD and Die Linke.

Which of these sides should America be on?

Last week, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to allow reasonable time for detainees at the Whipple detention center in Minneapolis to access legal counsel. In a 41-page decision, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel excoriated the government for policies and practices that “all but extinguish” a detainee’s right to counsel. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to professor Linus Chan, the James H. Binger Clinical Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota and the faculty director of the Detainee Rights Clinic, where he represents people who are being detained by ICE or in danger of being detained by ICE.

Dahlia Lithwick: The Justice Department will likely appeal this order, but in the meantime, how much of a difference will this make for folks swept up by ICE in Minnesota, assuming they get 72 hours before being removed to Texas, per the new order? What kind of a difference will this make for clients like yours?

Linus Chan: It’s going to be a huge difference. But also, it’s just returning things to the status quo. And I will be frank, it’s not as if the status quo was a paragon of attorney access, but at the same time, there had always been an operative norm that detainees should be able to talk to their lawyers and not suddenly be transported out of state with no ability to let their loved ones know what’s going on, and even themselves maybe not knowing what’s going on. So this is really important.

Under the old processes, they would get detained, and then they would go through what’s called processing—they might have their biometrics done, there might be an interview with an officer to confirm information that they have in the system, and after that conversation, they would then be put in a holding area for a few hours, and then put into one of the county jails in Minnesota. Most of the time the person’s stay for detention would be either in Minnesota or around the Midwest.

One of the big departures in current practice from what it was in the past was that ICE’s logistical acumen has reached the point of arresting someone at, let’s say, 9:00 in the morning and having them on a plane by noon. It was working like clockwork. People were not going through that longer process I described. They were going very, very quickly, and they could find themselves suddenly in El Paso or New Mexico, most often in Texas because the detention capacity in Texas has grown a lot.

Now, let’s assume this is a client of yours. Even if you knew they were at the Bishop Whipple building, there was no easy way to contact them. If you went online to the detainee locator, a lot of the time it would say the person is in custody, but it would not tell you where they were. It would direct you to call ICE at this number. Of course I’ve done this, I’ve called the number, and nobody ever picks up. It’s just a dead number. So then you have no idea at all what’s going on, but you do know how quickly they have put people on an actual plane out of the country, and have done so even when they legally should not be able to.

On top of that, we have a Trump administration that says that even if they know that it was a mistake, they don’t have to correct that mistake. Once a person is no longer in U.S. custody, they say this is a foreign-power problem, and they don’t have any means to fix it if they are out of the country.

The biggest source of concern and trauma comes from family members who are trying to figure out whether their family member has been kidnapped or whether they’re in immigration detention, and they can’t find out for several hours. So the fact that we have this order that is both trying to make sure that there is attorney access as well as to slow that process down, of transfers, can be tremendously important and powerful. It also gets into another issue which was in terms of habeas access.

Do you want to talk about how that’s changed? Because it seems to me that’s a cornerstone. I think people glaze over because it seems hypertechnical, but this is really where the rubber meets the road.

Habeas, the great writ, is in our Constitution, it’s an English tradition that predates our country, and it’s the general idea that if the government wants to imprison someone, then at some point or another, they need to justify that imprisonment. And if that imprisonment violates any law, and in this case, the United States, violates the Constitution, then a court can order that person to be released.

The history of the writ of habeas corpus and immigration is a very long one. In fact, it goes all the way back to the Chinese exclusion cases, back in the 1860s, 1870s, 1880s, where the federal government was trying to exclude Chinese people from coming to the United States, even if in some cases they were U.S. citizens or had the proper documentation. The way that people would challenge the laws or challenge the policy was through the writ of habeas corpus. There was a period of time. before what’s called the administrative period, where the writ of habeas corpus was the only way to challenge an order of deportation. Let’s say you were ordered deported and you now faced banishment from your country. The only way to get a judge to look at it was to give a writ of habeas corpus.

In the intervening years, there’s been a shift that started most dramatically in the late 1990s, where Congress really did not want immigrants to file writs of habeas corpus to challenge removal orders. So they started to take away the ability of courts to do that. In 2005, there was passage of what’s called the Real ID Act, which was a post- 9/11 piece of legislation that came from this idea that the problem with immigration enforcement was too much review, that there was too much legal process. So they cut it off and basically said that no court can look at the lawfulness of immigration deportation orders, even through habeas, that there is one way, and the only way is through what’s called a circuit court review, having the federal appellate courts eventually review it. That was a huge dramatic change.

But it didn’t prevent people from arguing that their detention was unlawful, while it prevented people from arguing that their removal or their deportation order was unlawful. And that has become so important, because this administration is deliberately using detention as the tool and as the weapon to try to push as many people out as possible. And they are explicit about this. When the students were getting notices that suddenly their visas were being revoked, they were getting letters that said, By the way, if you don’t want to end up detained, you might want to leave now. On the CBP One Home app, they say, You don’t want to get detained, right? Go ahead and sign up to get $1,000 and leave. There’s a reason they are gleefully talking about all the money that they’re using to build detention camps, because it’s driving that.

When they expand detention, when they go back on the former norms, there’s only one way to actually get people to examine whether they could do those things or not, and that’s through the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, as powerful as it is—and it is—has become more and more difficult to use thanks to layers of  legal doctrines lately.

One of them is what’s called the immediate custodian rule. That is, you can only file a habeas in the district court where they are actually being detained. When I referenced earlier how people didn’t know where they were going, how quickly they were getting transferred, that has become one of the controversies between litigants, the court, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I had this situation where a client of mine was detained one morning, and I filed habeas the next day—this is before it became clear how quickly out-of-state transfers were happening. I filed habeas, and looked my client up on the detainee locator. I couldn’t find her, her family didn’t know where she was, they couldn’t call her, no one knew where she was, and no one was picking up. This was a weekend. ICE had picked her up on Saturday. I filed the habeas corpus on Sunday. Their first reply to that habeas corpus was: You filed in the wrong court. By the time you filed it, she was already in Houston. The case in question, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, said you have to file habeas within the district of confinement, which meant that I was supposed to have filed it in Houston, even though I didn’t know where she was.

The conditions of detention and the scope of what is coming is the end in itself here, because the administration wants people to self-deport. What we are really seeing here is a weaponization of the detention itself. Detention has become the objective, and the crueler the detention, the bigger the win for this administration.

One of the things that’s always been remarkable, and I use the word remarkable because I kind of get stuck on these adjectives, is that as a child growing up as a Gen Xer, there was always this idea of freedom—the American view that we are a free country. If you look at what freedom means, it seems pretty axiomatic to think, Freedom means not being put in jail. But what I think has really become true generally in our society, and now more specifically with immigration, is that we’ve gotten so used to this idea that we can be detained, that we can be imprisoned, that there are all these justifications that the government has to imprison us.

It wasn’t until, I would argue, one of the most important decisions in the 1980s, which justified denying criminal bail to people, that really led to this idea that as long as the government says you’re a danger and you’re a flight risk, you are going to have to disprove it before you can be released. Even though the criminal system has a very important idea that the burden should be on the government, and not on the person being detained, and many immigration folks are trying to push the immigration system to more resemble that burden, if you speak to most on-the-ground criminal defense attorneys, it’s just words on a piece of paper. There has been an unfortunate acceptance of the idea that it’s OK to be detained.

Look at Minnesota, where they are arresting protesters or arresting observers, then they might spend eight hours or overnight, and then be released in negative-20-degree temperatures in the middle of a park without any of their possessions or their phone. That has happened. And then the government is not even bothering to charge them because they don’t think that they actually can make a good case. It’s just another example of how we’ve accepted as a society that when people get arrested, there must be good reason to do it. That’s amazing to me. Doesn’t that completely strike at the heart of us being a free country?

The fact that they could, as has happened here, literally break down the doors to our homes and arrest us without a warrant and then haul us in, and then the only thing we’ll get after they release us after several hours is not even an apology. It shouldn’t shock me but it does. They killed two people with witnesses and video recording in Minneapolis. They won’t apologize for that. So of course they’re not going to apologize for shooting a woman five times in Chicago. They’re not going to apologize for taking people and putting them in a cell for eight hours and then releasing them with no justification. They are not apologizing for the amount of trauma that they are imposing. They believe they’re unaccountable. That’s the thing that I think we really need to try to fix.

The United States government has begun construction of a multibillion-dollar detention camp system in the newest phase of Stephen Miller’s mass deportation strategy. The Department of Homeland Security has purchased two megawarehouses to be converted into 8,000-to-10,000-bed detention centers, with reported plans to buy and convert more than a dozen other warehouses for “processing” masses of new detainees. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick discussed, with journalist Andrea Pitzer, the clear and chilling picture of what the Trump administration is building. Pitzer is the author of several books, including One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, and her most recent newsletter post is “Building the Camps: The Warehouseification of Detention and Initial Thoughts on Stopping It.” The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: What is being built? At what speed is it being built? At what cost is it being built? How is it that we’re at the place where the language that you use in your post, concentration camps, actually is not just apt but has become fairly obvious?

Andrea Pitzer: The U.S. already had a pretty extensive immigration deportation system. In the first Trump administration, the White House wanted to prioritize the kinds of optics that signaled that it could go after anybody at any time. That led to a sort of a Keystone Cops approach, and so the numbers of people deported were in fact lower than under Barack Obama. But the optics of things like family separations and the deliberate cruelty were really apparent. The administration learned from that first outing that it needed to do more planning and be more strategic. Now that Donald Trump has returned to office, we’re still seeing a lot of Keystone Cops stuff that the administration probably didn’t intend for people to see, but we’re also seeing a lot of deliberate cruelty on the streets that it does intend for people to see.

Meanwhile, the White House is hoovering up warehouses. Before all these warehouse purchases, there was a turn toward facilities like Camp East Montana, which is this enormous facility that was stood up just last August within Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas. They were literally building it out with tents as they were bringing people in. They’ve decided that it doesn’t really meet their needs, and so they are now turning to acquiring these warehouses. There are over 100 the administration in the process of working toward. It’s spent about three-quarters of a billion dollars on buying these so far.

The infrastructure of all that is extraordinary. When you look at some of the biggest concentration camp systems across the world, we are actually approaching or ahead of the numbers for those massive famous ones. The Nazis came to power in 1933 and immediately, within weeks, had opened Dachau—which, I will note, was founded on a converted factory site—so we’re echoing this history right from the beginning. It was not until about five and a half years later, with Kristallnacht, that they started doing large sweeps of German Jews into camps. In that 48-hour period, more than 30,000 Jews were sent into concentration camps. That was five years into Nazi rule.

We are at the end of the first year of this second Trump administration. And even when you look at, let’s say, 1940 to 1941, World War II had started, Germany was putting a lot more people into camps, and yet we have more people in immigrant detention today than Nazi Germany did seven years into the Third Reich, which I think is just astounding when you think about it.

Even before he was elected, Trump was talking about this mass deportation campaign, that there were up to 20 million people in the United States illegally. Historians debate how many people moved through the Soviet gulag, whether it was 18 million or 20 million people in more than two decades who went through that system. What the Trump administration is talking about are those numbers in a four-year period. If you know anything about how horrific the Soviet gulag was, you’ll recall that it transformed the country for generations that followed, and it wrecked lives.

The Soviets didn’t know in advance what they were doing, but Stephen Miller has that context. That is something key people in the administration are openly embracing. We are already seeing conditions in those camps that rival early Nazi concentration camps, with illness, disease, and reports of limited access to medical care. We’ve had a killing in Camp East Montana that has been declared a homicide. People have already died.

This is not something this administration stumbles into sideways, right? This was the plan. Last April, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was heard to say that what he really, really wanted to do was to just run deportations like a business: “Like Amazon Prime, but with human beings,” he said. We are witnessing the construction of a system for just warehousing people systematically. How much of what we are seeing playing out right now is just the tip of the iceberg for what is imagined?

If we look at that “Amazonification,” different concentration camps evolved over time in different ways. I often use the Nazi example because it’s almost the only concentration camp system people know, even though there have been a bunch of different ones. The Nazis were the very first who took this logistical approach that we think of as Amazonification now. There was a detainee named Margarete Buber-Neumann, who wrote an amazing memoir, Under Two Dictators. She was detained in the Soviet gulag system, then later held in the Nazi concentration camp system. The Soviets handed her over to the Gestapo at the beginning of World War II, and she describes coming to the Nazi camp system and being issued clothes and utensils to eat with. It was this whole system that was very sadistic, but it was incredibly scripted and organized. Of course, that went to hell once the war started, but this warehouse-ification of people was exactly the initial Nazi goal. The extermination of people through that warehouse system became the later explicit goal.

In terms of what our government is doing, I want to make clear: This can happen in a country only when things have been deeply wrong for a number of years in a number of ways. What we’ve already seen in the U.S., with prisons, with decades of demonizing immigrants, with the already existing nature of our punitive immigration system, where detention is literally used as a deterrent and to do harm to people—all that gives Trump these initial tools that they are clearly planning to expand on in tremendous ways.

People are waking up to what’s happening on the ground, which is amazing and offers all kinds of potential for things to do. But I don’t think people understand the scope of it. If they end up with all these warehouses, what automatically follows from that is you have transit camps and you have hub camps and you have whole communities whose identities become bound up with these warehouses. This is why we see some of these small towns and cities already working to reject the Immigration and Customs Enforcement warehouses. Dachau is the name of the town. Just think, for how many places in our country is that what is going to be meant by their names going forward?

According to the plans that we see from Miller and Trump, this will be as large as—and potentially even larger than—the U.S. prison system, which is already so much larger than almost anything else in the world. It will exist almost entirely outside the realm of oversight, of accountability. Concentration camp systems are always an end run around the existing legal system in a country at a given time. This isn’t just going to be criminal detainees. We’re already seeing people with documentation disappearing in this system, people who are here lawfully. We have seen U.S. citizens that have ended up in some of these settings. The goal is never to do detention against just the targeted group. The goal with these is always political: the expansion of political power and the entrenchment of political power. By definition, that means that other people will be going into these camps over time. The objective is really expanding and locking down control over public life in America. It is the ability to silence any kind of dissent.

Americans are waking up to the reality of horrifying dispatches from Camp East Montana, located near El Paso, Texas: reports of hunger, of violence, of sexual assault, of death. Who is accountable for this?

I think everybody involved has to run the risk of accountability. The sooner we can shut down the largest wave of this as it’s growing, the smaller that number will be. And it is better not only that less harm comes to people; even on the other side of this, the fewer people who will have to be held accountable in some way, the better it is for society. So even for the perpetrators, it is better if we can shut this down, but especially for the people that would have harm done to them.

It may be hard to imagine accountability in this moment, when so many systems are collapsing, but I think of the people I talked to in Argentina who had been tortured and held. In some cases, they had been sexually assaulted, their friends killed. There was never a hard end where the military made itself accountable there. The dictatorship ended, but there was never this moment of accountability. That came years later. One woman I interviewed remembered that while she was blindfolded, she was able to peek under her blindfold and see a tile pattern on the floor. When it came time to testify, they testified to everything that they could remember. Somebody went and found that tile pattern, and they found the floor, they found the house she had been held in, and they talked to the neighbors, and the neighbors recalled hearing the screams. They were able to work their way through these unbelievably difficult investigations to bring leading military figures to justice, but also people underneath them.

You have to, first of all, for PR purposes, make everybody think they’re going to be accountable for everything going forward. Then, in the end, on the other side of this, you decide how you deal with the small potatoes. But there is going to have to be some kind of accountability. It was a serious shame from the Obama era that this was not done when he came to power in early 2009, in the face of what had happened in the war on terror. The lack of accountability at that point has enabled much of what has followed. Obama’s not personally responsible as if he had launched the war on terror himself, but he bears some of that responsibility, because without those accountability moments, this is exactly where you end up.

Reforms are good, for sure, but if you’re focused on them, the correct response to Dachau was not better training for the guards. So we can talk about better training, and we can talk about standards, but that ultimately is not going to be what addresses this. Everybody needs to face accountability.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Poland’s Ministry of Defence has banned Chinese cars – and any others include tech to record position, images, or sound – from entering protected military facilities.

A Tuesday announcement from the country’s Ministry of Defence says the decision came after risk analysis of the potential for the many gadgets built into modern cars to allow “uncontrolled acquisition and use of data.”

The ban also prohibits officials connecting their work phones to infotainment systems in China-made cars.

The ban isn’t permanent: the Ministry has called for development of a vetting process to allow carmakers to undergo a security assessment that, if passed, will mean their vehicles can enter protected facilities. Exemptions are also available for inspections carried out by state and local governments, and during rescues.

Poland says its ban is in line with standards observed by NATO members and other countries.

The Register is not aware of any other nation announcing a specific ban on made-in-China cars, however most nations do not allow filming and recording on military premises. The USA has banned the use of software from China and Russia in connected cars, effectively banning cars made in both countries from its shores.

And in Australia, minister for cybersecurity Tony Burke acquired a made-in-China electric vehicle and reported it to relevant authorities who advised him on necessary precautions.

This ban could be hard to enforce because European automakers such as Volvo and Polestar make some of their models in China.

Bans on Chinese technology are nothing new, as many nations decided Huawei and ZTE kit should not be allowed into their telecoms network because they could facilitate snooping, either with backdoored tech or if Beijing used its powers to compel co-operation on intelligence operations from any Middle Kingdom company. Sources tell The Register the latter scenario was the greater risk, as network equipment vendors nearly always obtain records of their clients’ operations and that info is very useful intelligence.

Whatever the truth of the matter, China managed to thoroughly infiltrate many networks through the Salt Typhoon attacks.

It’s been a busy week on the technology front for Poland’s military, as on Wednesday it announced it will use Dell kit to power an AI implementation center that will work on a Polish-language AI model called “Bielik.” Poland plans to adapt the model, which was developed by a local company called SpeakLeash with help from Intel, to power military applications. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/ai_impact_tech_jobs_india/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Indian think tank the Council for Research on International Economic Relations has found AI is not an immediate threat to the nation’s IT services sector.

The organization (ICRIER) this week published a case study titled “Al and Jobs This Time Is No Different” [PDF] that finds AI will hit the jobs market like any other wave of automation – with initial worries of massive job losses, but that over time “rising productivity will lower costs, drive a massive expansion in the consumption of AI-enabled products, and ultimately generate net positive employment opportunities.”

To reach that conclusion, ICRIER surveyed 651 IT firms and interviewed industry leaders.

The organization found that while hiring in the Indian IT sector has moderated (The Register has found it’s stalled at the big four outsourcers), the strongest demand from employers is for roles like software analysts and developers, or mathematicians, that are most exposed to AI.

The think tank believes that hiring trend suggests “AI is functioning primarily as a complement to high-skill technical work rather than as a substitute.”

A majority of firms ICRIER surveyed reported “significant productivity gains following AI adoption, reflected in higher and better-quality output, as well as time and cost savings.”

27 percent of the firms the think tank surveyed feel their headcount will shrink due to AI adoption, and 28 percent expect to hire more workers. 44 percent expect “no major change.”

But more than half of respondents expect to slow hiring for entry-level staff and the think tank has already observed a “general moderation” of early career hiring.

ICRIER is confident its survey is accurate, but thinks its projections for future hiring may be a little pessimistic.

“History suggests that many of the most impactful technology-driven jobs will be created by startups that have yet to be established – or are currently taking shape in classrooms and garages,” the study states. “While some incumbent firms are likely to survive and thrive in the AI age, it is new, AI-centric firms that are most likely to disrupt incumbents and generate a large share of future employment.”

The think thank therefore finds “good reason to be optimistic about India’s job prospects in the AI era.”

“As home to one of the world’s largest pools of AI-skilled workers, and with global demand for AI-enabled products set to expand rapidly, Indian workers are likely to see large and sustained increase in demand for their services in the medium to long-run.”

All of which suggests that “My job was outsourced to India and all I got was this t-shirt” jokes may remain more common than “My job was outsourced to AI” lamentations.

But ICRIER warns India’s government should not assume the nation’s tech sector will automatically come through the advent of AI.

“India’s IT firms are not hiring enough workers with skills in large language model operations, are not expanding their R&D divisions, and, most importantly, are not investing adequately in training and upskilling,” the study found. “The shortage of qualified AI trainers, the limited AI skills among new labour market entrants, and policy and regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI are challenges that must be urgently addressed if India’s IT sector is to fully harness the power and potential of generative AI.” ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/microsoft_glass_storage/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft this week detailed new research aimed at preserving data in borosilicate glass plates for thousands of years longer than conventional media like hard drives or magnetic tape, without needing to worry about bit rot.

The boffins at Redmond have been exploring this concept as part of Project Silica since 2019, using femtosecond lasers to encode data as voxels (3D pixels) inside glass.

Glass is resilient to water, heat, and dust. It also breaks down more slowly than the plastics or mechanical components found in hard disks or magnetic tape drives, both still widely deployed for archive storage media.

Up until recently, Microsoft&#39;s experiments into glass-based storage have required special fused silica glass, which is both challenging and expensive to manufacture. In a paper published in the journal Nature this week, Microsoft researchers now say these long-term storage qualities can be achieved using the same kind of borosilicate glass found in oven doors and Pyrex glassware.

In their testing, they were able to etch 258 layers of data totaling roughly 2.02 TB onto a 2 mm thick borosilicate glass plate while achieving write speeds of between 18.4 and 65.9 Mbps depending on the number of laser beams used. That top speed is significantly faster than the 25.6 Mbps achieved using fused silica glass, but with less than half the density, at 2.02 TB vs 4.84 TB per platter. Additionally, they were able to reduce the amount of equipment required to read back data from the plates from three or four cameras to just one.

The way Microsoft is etching the voxel data into the glass hasn&#39;t changed — it&#39;s still using femtosecond lasers — but its method for doing so has. Early attempts at glass-based storage, including Microsoft&#39;s, used &quot;birefringent&quot; voxels, which means they refract light differently depending on their polarization. According to Microsoft, this required multiple laser pulses to encode the data, which they were eventually able to reduce to two. They&#39;ve now developed a different phase-based voxel, which requires just one laser pulse.

In addition to reducing the number of laser pulses required to write data to the plates, Microsoft has also managed to increase the number of voxels written in parallel, significantly boosting transfer rates.

As we noted last year, this is just what Microsoft has managed to achieve in the lab and isn&#39;t necessarily reflective of the technology&#39;s storage density or transfer rate if it&#39;s ever productized. For example, the researchers suggest that 16 or more beams writing in parallel could dramatically increase write speeds over the one to four beams used in its borosilicate glass trials.

Also, while more efficient, the approach isn&#39;t perfect. The phase-based voxels showed a greater propensity for interference, but the researchers note that this can be effectively mitigated by machine learning-based classification models.

Finally, Microsoft conducted an accelerated aging test to extrapolate the media&#39;s viable storage life. Despite our best efforts, existing storage media have a set life span before they begin to break down and are subject to bit rot. This can happen relatively quickly in the case of flash media, particularly when left unpowered in warm climates.

This doesn&#39;t appear to be an issue with glass, with Microsoft&#39;s trials supporting a viable storage life of more than 10,000 years.

Despite Microsoft&#39;s ongoing progress into glass-based storage, its future remains somewhat vague. In a blog post published alongside the paper, the company notes that the &quot;research phase is now complete, and we are continuing to consider learnings from Project Silica as we explore the ongoing need for long-term preservation of digital information.&quot;

That&#39;s not exactly a development road map. &quot;Microsoft, like other companies, takes many considerations into account when determining productization and investment priorities. Microsoft continues to value the intellectual property in Project Silica and is exploring options for how to apply the research learnings,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson told El Reg ®.

            <h2>Adidas investigates third-party data breach after criminals claim they pwned the sportswear giant</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/18/adidas_investigates_thirdparty_data_breach/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Adidas has confirmed it is investigating a third-party breach at one of its partner companies after digital thieves claimed they stole information and technical data from the German sportswear giant.

&quot;We have been made aware of a potential data protection incident at one of our independent licensing partners and distributor for martial arts products,&quot; an Adidas spokesperson told The Register. &quot;This is an independent company with its own IT systems.&quot;

Adidas declined to answer our questions about when the compromise occurred, or what information the crooks pilfered during the intrusion. The spokesperson added that there&#39;s &quot;no indication that the adidas IT infrastructure, our own e-commerce platforms, or any of our consumer data are affected by the incident.&quot;

Allegations of an incident at Adidas emerged on February 16, when someone claiming to be the Lapsus$ Group posted on BreachForums (screenshot shared here on Daily Dark Web) that they compromised the sportswear giant’s extranet. According to the crooks, the stolen files – 815,000 rows of information – allegedly include: first and last names, email addresses, passwords, birthdays, company names, and &quot;a lot of technical data.&quot;

This latest breach follows a similar, third-party security incident last year affecting the sportswear multinational in May 2025. As we reported at the time, Adidas notified customers that some of their data was stolen after an &quot;unauthorized&quot; person swiped it from a &quot;third-party customer service provider.&quot;

Lapsus$ is a chaotic crew of teens and young people that gained notoriety during a 2021-2022 crime spree. The gang broke into and attempted to extort telecoms giant BT, Nvidia, Microsoft, Samsung, Vodafone, fintech firm Revolut, and Okta, using a mix of phone-based social engineering, SIM swapping, and even paying employees of target organizations for access to credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes.

In March 2022, UK police arrested and then released seven people, aged 16 to 21, for their alleged role in Lapsus$ activities. Police re-arrested and charged two of the teens for their involvement with the cybercrime gang later that month.

More recently, in early August 2025, the crew – or at least some of its members – joined a cybercrime collective with Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters, operating under the name Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. Two months later, in October 2025, the extortion collab listed Adidas on its leak site, and claimed to have stolen more than 20 million sensitive records back in February 2024. ®

            <h2>As memory shortage persists, vendor price quotes are not long remembered</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/18/memory_shortage_persists_vendor_change_terms/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you like the price of that server, PC, or storage array, you&#39;d better act fast.

The spiraling cost of computer memory is forcing hardware vendors to shrink the time a quoted price is honored, as AI buildouts fueled by huge capital expenditures are causing massive shortages, analysts with IDC told The Register.

“For memory customers, price negotiations have been challenging given limited availability,” said Jeff Janukowicz, research vice president at IDC. “Suppliers are allocating constrained supply and prioritizing segments that are willing—or able—to absorb higher pricing. This dynamic has led to ongoing price discovery across the market and the renegotiation of pricing contracts.”

Compared to just a few months ago, pricing for many memory products has nearly doubled, he said, which will affect both consumer and commercial electronics markets.

Both Cisco and HPE have adjusted the time they are allowed to change prices or cancel orders in response to the shortage. Cisco told channel partners this week it can now cancel compute orders up to 45 days before shipment. Cisco may also adjust compute order pricing between the order date and the shipment, and it may reduce price protection on deals, according to CRN. Cisco did not reply to an email from The Register seeking comment.

HPE has also cut the expiration date of its quotes in half, leaving customers with 14 days to decide, down from 30 days. This reportedly excludes public sector, B2B, and OEM customers, and the company has updated the contract terms and conditions for server and GreenLake orders to allow price adjustments until the date of shipment.

HPE spokesman Adam Bauer told us that any action like this would be “rare and only in response to material increases in forecasted commodity costs.”

In an email provided to The Register and other media outlets, HPE’s Simon Ewington said this is being done in response to “significant constraints” on components worldwide.

“This is a fluid environment, and we are working hard to respond to it while helping our valued customers and partners understand what to expect,” Ewington wrote.

Janukowicz told The Register IDC sees no sign of slowing demand, particularly as cloud providers have upped their expected spend on data center projects in 2026, with AWS, Google, Meta, and Microsoft telling investors recently they expect to spend a collective total of more than $600 billion to construct AI projects.

“Compared to just a few months ago, pricing for many memory products has nearly doubled. We’re operating in an environment where memory supply is extremely tight, driven by continued growth in AI infrastructure demand,” he said. “While AI headlines often focus on compute, realizing the benefits of AI also requires substantial memory and storage to feed and support that compute. Because memory is pervasive—spanning PCs and smartphones to the data center—the impact is broad-based.”

While Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said earlier this month that he expects memory shortages to last until 2028, Janukowicz said IDC expects prices to moderate later this year.

“However, as long as AI demand remains robust, demand for memory should continue to be strong,” he said. ®

            <div id="article-text">If you&#39;ve ever wanted to make music but have neither the talent nor the inspiration, Google has the AI tool for you. Gemini will now generate a 30-second song for you directly from a text prompt, photo, or video.

Google launched Lyria 3, the latest iteration of its music creation AI, on Wednesday, and has made it far more available than the previous versions of the engine. Like image creation tool Nano Banana and video-making AI Veo, Lyria 3 lives right in the Gemini Tools menu, where it can be selected and used to create a song with little more than a short description.

Google&#39;s examples in its announcement post include an R&B song about socks finding their matches in a washing machine and an afrobeat track about childhood memories cooking plantain-based meals with one&#39;s mother, both of which included lyrics that Google appeared proud to say were written on the fly by AI.

&quot;No need to provide your own lyrics! They&#39;ll be generated for you based on your prompt,&quot; senior product managers Joël Yawili (Gemini) and Myriam Hamed Torres (Google DeepMind) wrote in the announcement before unironically adding that &quot;the goal of these tracks [is] to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.&quot;

Because nothing says &quot;I love you, Mom&quot; like a song written and performed by a Google AI for the low, low cost of ruining the environment. Oh, and Google is also throwing in cover art generated by Nano Banana, so no need to actually find a sentimental picture to include.

Lyria first launched in 2023, with Google later deploying it in YouTube experiments such as Dream Track, which let creators generate 30-second soundtracks for YouTube Shorts in the style of participating artists, and in Music AI Sandbox, a separate set of tools aimed at musicians looking to sketch and iterate on ideas with AI assistance.

According to Wednesday&#39;s announcement, Lyria 3 improves on previous Lyria models by adding the aforementioned lyric generation feature, as well as giving prompters more control over style, vocals, and other particulars. Lyria 3 can also &quot;create more realistic and musically complex tracks,&quot; Google said. Dream Track, naturally, is being updated with Lyria 3, though it&#39;s not clear whether YouTube creators will be able to spin tracks longer than 30 seconds, which Google said is Lyria 3&#39;s current limit.

Lyria&#39;s original iteration, as paired with Dream Track, included training data from licensed artists like T-Pain, Demi Lovato, Sia, and other pop middleweights. Google didn&#39;t mention who it may have signed partnership agreements with to train Lyria 3, but did say that it programmed the model to be &quot;very mindful of copyright&quot; and agreements it signed with musicians who offered up their intellectual property as meat for its AI grinder.

&quot;Music generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists,&quot; Google explained. &quot;If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood.&quot;

There are also filters in place to prevent Lyria 3 from creating something too close to an extant song, Google explained, but it admitted those filters might not get everything right, and asked users to report content that might be a copyright infringement.

For those who wish to experiment with generating a bit of soulless, 30-second musical AI slop, Lyria 3 is rolling out globally beginning February 18 for all Gemini users 18+, and is available now in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese with additional languages to be added. It’s launching on desktop first, though not everyone appears to have access yet (it’s not showing up for this vulture), with the Gemini mobile app set to get access over the next several days. ®

            <div id="article-text">The Meta CEO took the stand to testify about safety decisions, including why Instagram didn’t ban certain beauty filters.

The Meta CEO took the stand to testify about safety decisions, including why Instagram didn’t ban certain beauty filters.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg entered a downtown Los Angeles courthouse in largely the same way as all the attorneys, reporters, and advocates who’d come to watch his landmark trial testimony, but with one notable difference: he was flanked by an entourage that appeared to be wearing Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses. To get to the courtroom, he walked past a crowd of parents whose children died after struggling with issues they attribute to the design of social media platforms including those that Meta makes. He would spend the next eight hours often answering questions in his signature matter-of-fact (or less charitably, monotone) cadence, denying his platform was liable for the harms.

Zuckerberg was questioned through the morning session by Mark Lanier, the lead litigator for plaintiff K.G.M. She’s a 20-year-old woman who claims Meta and Google’s design features encouraged her to compulsively use their apps and led to mental health issues, which the companies generally deny. Lanier’s charismatic style, drawing from his other profession as a pastor, was in stark contrast to Zuckerberg’s responses on the witness stand, where he tried to inject nuance into how employees discussed — and sometimes criticized — various safety decisions. At times, Zuckerberg pushed back on Lanier’s characterization of his testimony. “That’s not what I’m saying at all,” he said at one point, according to NPR. Meanwhile, the judge admonished people in the courtroom not to wear Meta’s AI glasses, and that they could be held in contempt of court if they fail to delete any recordings; parents whose children died after experiencing harms they attribute to his platform watched on.

During his time on the stand, Zuckerberg was pressed on both his decisions at Meta and previous public statements. He was asked about alleged contradictions between prior claims that he’d tried to keep kids under 13 from Facebook and Instagram and documents describing the value of getting users on the platforms young. He was also asked to address decisions he had made that would impact young users of his platform, such as his decision to forgo a permanent ban on AR filters that alter users’ faces in ways that simulate cosmetic surgery.

“You don’t really build social media apps unless you care about people being able to express themselves”

Zuckerberg’s answer to the AR filter question helped illustrate one of his go-to strategies: arguing that Meta had made careful decisions to balance free expression against potential harms. During the testimony, Zuckerberg addressed a discussion among Meta executives in 2019 about whether to lift a temporary ban on the filters, which Instagram chief Adam Mosseri was asked about last week. Zuckerberg testified that after reviewing research on the filters’ impact on user wellbeing, he felt that the available evidence of their harm was not compelling enough to justify the tradeoff to limiting a form of speech on the platform. “On some level you don’t really build social media apps unless you care about people being able to express themselves,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we need to be careful about when we say, ‘hey there’s a restriction on what people can say or express themselves.’ I think we need to have quite clear evidence that thing would be bad.”

Zuckerberg ultimately decided to allow creators to make some of the filters, with the exception of things like mimicking nip and tuck lines, but not to recommend them or for Instagram to make them itself.

Lanier suggested that Meta prioritized increasing users’ time spent on the platform rather than wellbeing, but — as he’s long done in other settings — Zuckerberg insisted that Meta has intentionally shifted its internal messaging to focus on increasing product value for users, even if it leads to short-term decline in usage. While some documents showed that employees considered how banning the filters could discourage some users, Zuckerberg said that wasn’t a big factor in his decision since they weren’t hugely popular tools in the first place.

“I don’t have a college degree in anything”

Still, Zuckerberg acknowledged that not everyone on his team agreed with the decision. “You had a set of people who think about wellbeing issues who had some concern that there might be an issue, but weren’t able to show any data that I found compelling that there was enough of an issue to be worth restricting people’s expression,” he said. Lanier showed him an email from another Meta executive who said she respected Zuckerberg’s call, but didn’t agree with it based on the risks and her personal experience with a daughter who experienced body dysmorphia. “There won’t be hard data to prove causal harm for many years,” the executive said.

When Zuckerberg reiterated he didn’t find the available research compelling enough to justify a broader ban, Lanier asked if Zuckerberg had a degree in a variety of professions. “I don’t have a college degree in anything,” Zuckerberg responded.

Zuckerberg’s full-day testimony concluded part of the second week of a trial expected to last at least six. Jurors will soon hear from former Meta employees, including those who disagreed with the company’s approach to teen safety, and executives from YouTube, which is also a defendant in the case.

Parents who watched on from the public seats told reporters that they didn’t feel they learned much new from the testimony, but many said they still felt it important to make their presence known to the CEO. “I think it’s pretty obvious who the parents in the room are, and I hope that when he looks out into that courtroom, because we’re sitting right there, that he sees that and he feels that, because the only way we’re really going to get change from him is when he’s empathetic,” said Amy Neville, whose son Alexander died from fentanyl poisoning at age 14 allegedly facilitated by Snapchat (which settled its part of the K.G.M. case). “When we can touch his empathy, we can get the change that we seek. And so hopefully, maybe we got a little bit of that today. Remains to be seen.”

            <div id="article-text">Phison’s CEO agrees the RAM crisis could get bad in 2H 2026.

Phison’s CEO agrees the RAM crisis could get bad in 2H 2026.

Phison is one of the leading makers of controller chips for SSDs and other flash memory devices — and CEO Pua Khein-Seng has now become a leading voice for just how bad the RAM shortage might get.

Companies may need to cut back their product lines in the second half of 2026, and some companies will even die if they can’t get the components they need, he agreed, in a televised interview with Ningguan Chen of Taiwanese broadcaster Next TV.

While the interview’s entirely in Chinese, friends of The Verge stepped forward to confirm parts of a machine-translated summary that’s been making headlines. They also note, importantly, that it’s the interviewer asking whether companies might shut down or product lines might discontinue. Khein-Seng largely just agreed and clarified that it’ll happen if these companies cannot secure enough RAM.

He also adds that he expects people will start fixing products more often when they break, instead of throwing them in the trash, over the next couple years.

It’s genuinely possible that some companies won’t be able to secure enough RAM. AI data centers are gobbling up the vast majority of the world’s memory supply as part of a global buildout, creating an unprecedented imbalance in supply and demand that’s seen RAM prices triple, quadruple, or even sextuple over the past handful of months. Even Nvidia might skip shipping a gaming GPU for the first time in 30 years. Even Apple may have trouble securing enough RAM now, not to mention memory chips for SSDs, and other vital components.

The RAM shortage may affect everything that computing touches over the next several years, as only three companies control 93 percent of the entire DRAM market, and while those three companies are building more facilities, they don’t want to build too fast. All three have decided to prioritize profits instead of risking overproduction that could lose them money later.

Tomorrow, February 19th, I’ll have a report on The Verge about how “RAMageddon” will affect you, even if you’d never think to buy a stick of memory yourself.

﻿The new PencilWash’s handle is just 1.5-inches in diameter, letting the cleaner squeeze and clean under furniture, too.

Dyson has announced an alternate version of its skinny PencilVac that’s designed to clean spills and stains on hard floors instead of sucking up dirt and debris. Like the PencilVac, which Dyson called “world’s slimmest vacuum cleaner” when it was announced nine months ago, the new PencilWash squeezes a battery, motor, and other electronics into its 1.5-inch-diameter handle. But it trades a dust bin for a water reservoir located in its larger cleaning head featuring a single floor-scrubbing roller.

At 4.9 pounds without water or a low foaming cleaning solution in its tank, the PencilWash is slightly heavier than the four-pound PencilVac, but it’s also quite a bit cheaper. The PencilVac is $600 for the version featuring four spinning conical brush heads, while the new PencilWash is $349, including a charging stand for the handle portion.

Designed specifically for cleaning hard floors like tile, laminate, and sealed wood, the PencilWash features a pressurized hydration system to deliver fresh water that its high-density microfiber roller uses to scrub surfaces and then collect the dirty water afterwards. Floors aren’t left completely dry, but dry enough that any moisture remaining quickly evaporates. And unlike Dyson’s larger floor scrubbers, the PencilWash’s pivoting handle can lie nearly completely flat for reaching underneath furniture.

Battery life is estimated to be upwards of 30 minutes on a full charge, which matches the PencilVac on its lowest power setting. If that’s not enough time to clean all the floors in your palatial estate, the battery, located on the end of the PencilWash’s handle, can be swapped out with a backup that can be purchased separately.

The new wearable could arrive four years after Meta shelved plans for an earlier smartwatch.

Meta is planning to launch a smartwatch with health tracking and AI features later this year, along with an updated version of its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, The Information reports. The smartwatch would arrive ahead of a pair of mixed reality glasses, code-named Phoenix, that Meta has reportedly delayed until 2027 amidst efforts to streamline the company’s AR and MR roadmap.

Meta previously scrapped plans for an earlier smartwatch in 2022 due to technical challenges and cost-cutting measures. If the new watch, code-named Malibu 2, comes to fruition, it would intensify competition with Apple, which is rumored to be working on a pair of AI smart glasses that could launch next year, potentially rivaling Meta’s line of glasses. Meta would also face significant competition for users’ wrist space from Google, Garmin, Samsung, Fitbit, and others.

The Malibu 2 smartwatch follows Meta’s launch of its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses last year, which the company said proved popular enough that they had to pause the glasses’ international launch due to “unprecedented demand and limited inventory.” The Ray-Ban Display glasses use a neural wristband for gesture controls, which could potentially be replaced by a smartwatch.

While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday, many great iPad deals are available outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts come and go like changing winds, so there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s most affordable iPad, the iPad Mini, and the latest iPad Air. Hell, you can even often find discounts on the latest M5 iPad Pro, which is already on sale at multiple retailers.

All that being said, it’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve rounded up the best prices on every current iPad model, from the 11th-gen base iPad to the more powerful models with the M3, M4, and M5 chips.

Before we dive in, though, it’s worth noting that Apple is holding a “special Apple experience” in New York City on March 4th. While it’s unclear what exactly will be announced, recent rumors hint at an M4-powered iPad Air and a new entry-level iPad with support for Apple Intelligence. If you’d rather not wait and see, though, here are the best deals available.

Apple’s 11th-gen iPad landed on the scene in March. The newest base-model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model, but with 128GB of base storage (up from 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip used in the 10th-gen iPad. However, the newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1 and subsequent updates. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.

Pricing-wise, the latest iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We saw a pretty significant price drop to $279 on Black Friday, but right now it’s only available at Amazon starting at $321, which saves you $28. Alternatively, if you need more storage, you can buy the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $413 ($36 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon starting at $599 ($50 off).

The seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar in several ways to the previous model, but comes with some big internal upgrades. It includes faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.

The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, so the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.

Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at Amazon starting at $474, which is a far cry from its all-time low of $349 but still a $25 discount. If you need additional storage, you can pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon for $569 ($30 off), which is about $90 shy of the lowest price we’ve seen on the step-up configuration.

The 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer into the future than either the entry-level iPad or the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, plus compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard that has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys. In short, the Air is a credible laptop replacement.

The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as prior models — but it’s common to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $489 ($110 off). If you need more storage, you can grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $589 ($110 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $779 ($120 off). All models are currently $30 more than their lowest price to date.

The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Walmart with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $699 ($120 off), which is $50 shy of its best price to date. You can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $779 ($120 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $979 ($120 off).

While there are some deals floating around for the M4 iPad Pro, we’d argue none of them are particularly noteworthy given the current discounts on the 2025 iPad Pro. Apple’s latest high-end tablet offers a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including a faster M5 chip, a new C1X cellular modem (if you get the cellular version), and an N1 chip that handles Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. Apple also increased read and write speeds to its memory, and the latest Pro supports fast charging, allowing you to charge it to 50 percent capacity in about 30 minutes.

Although the tablet launched in October, we’re already seeing the price drop at several retailers. The 11-inch base model with 256GB of storage is currently down to $899 ($100 off) at B&H Photo, for instance, while the model with 512GB of storage is going for an all-time low of $999.99 (200 off) at Amazon. You can also snag the 1TB variant for $1,399.99 ($200 off) at Amazon.

If you want a larger display, you can get the 13-inch iPad Pro in its 256GB base configuration for $1,220 ($79 off) at Amazon. Meanwhile, the step-up model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is down to $1,399 (also $100 off) at Amazon, while the 1TB model can be had at Amazon for $1,775.99 (about $123 off).

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A set of bellwether cases alleging that social media platforms harmed teens’ safety and mental health is going to trial this year, putting executives like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the stand to answer questions about what they’ve done or not done to protect kids.

Unlike many earlier legal challenges against social media companies, these cases managed to overcome the companies’ attempts to get them dismissed based on objections citing Section 230, a law that protects online platforms from being held liable for their users’ speech. They accuse companies like Meta, Snap, TikTok, and Google-owned YouTube of designing their platforms in ways that, the plaintiffs claim, they knew could contribute to addiction, depression, and anxiety.

Follow along below for all of the latest updates from the trials we’re currently following.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg entered a downtown Los Angeles courthouse in largely the same way as all the attorneys, reporters, and advocates who’d come to watch his landmark trial testimony, but with one notable difference: he was flanked by an entourage that appeared to be wearing Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses. To get to the courtroom, he walked past a crowd of parents whose children died after struggling with issues they attribute to the design of social media platforms including those that Meta makes. He would spend the next eight hours often answering questions in his signature matter-of-fact (or less charitably, monotone) cadence, denying his platform was liable for the harms.

Zuckerberg was questioned through the morning session by Mark Lanier, the lead litigator for plaintiff K.G.M. She’s a 20-year-old woman who claims Meta and Google’s design features encouraged her to compulsively use their apps and led to mental health issues, which the companies generally deny. Lanier’s charismatic style, drawing from his other profession as a pastor, was in stark contrast to Zuckerberg’s responses on the witness stand, where he tried to inject nuance into how employees discussed — and sometimes criticized — various safety decisions. At times, Zuckerberg pushed back on Lanier’s characterization of his testimony. “That’s not what I’m saying at all,” he said at one point, according to NPR. Meanwhile, the judge admonished people in the courtroom not to wear Meta’s AI glasses, and that they could be held in contempt of court if they fail to delete any recordings; parents whose children died after experiencing harms they attribute to his platform watched on.

The Meta CEO walked through the public entrance of the LA Superior Court and past parent advocates and media waiting to learn if they’d get a seat to hear his testimony.

Lori Schott didn’t care what it took to haul her way from her small town in Eastern Colorado to show up to a Los Angeles courtroom where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify Wednesday. “I don’t care if I had to hire a pack mule to get me here, I was going to be here,” she told The Verge outside the courthouse Tuesday.

Schott’s daughter Annalee died by suicide at age 18 in 2020, after struggling with body image issues that her mother says were heightened by social media. After her death, Schott found journal entries where Annalee disparaged her own looks and compared herself to other girls’ profiles. “I was so worried about what my child was putting out online, I didn’t realize what she was receiving,” Schott said.

Just after we entered the courtroom, we learned that a juror has been hospitalized. The parties decided to postpone today’s testimony from former Meta employees to see if the juror can return. Regardless, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify tomorrow — either before the original juror, or an alternate.

Recently released documents show the big business opportunity that social media companies saw in recruiting teens to their platforms and how they discussed risks that heavy digital engagement could pose.

The documents were released last week as part of a major set of trials brought by school districts, state attorneys general, and others against Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, alleging the design of their products harmed young users. The Tech Oversight Project, which advocates for more regulations on tech platforms to safeguard teens online, compiled a report on the newly released documents, which were independently reviewed by The Verge. On Monday, a federal judge will hear arguments that will determine the scope of the trials, the first of which kicks off in June.

Over the next year, top social media executives are expected to take the witness stand to defend their companies from an avalanche of claims about their failure to protect kids.

The first of many trials is set to begin this month in California, when Meta, TikTok, and YouTube face claims that tech addiction harmed a teenager’s mental health. This case is just the tip of the legal iceberg. It kicks off one of two sets of so-called bellwether trials, where judges will hear a selection of cases that represent similar claims, whose outcomes will likely inform settlement amounts for the remaining cases. There are still thousands more cases behind them.

            <h2>Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/18/1133299/google-deepmind-wants-to-know-if-chatbots-are-just-virtue-signaling/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks.

With coding and math, you have clear-cut, correct answers that you can check, William Isaac, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, told me when I met him and Julia Haas, a fellow research scientist at the firm, for an exclusive preview of their work, which is published in Nature today. That’s not the case for moral questions, which typically have a range of acceptable answers: “Morality is an important capability but hard to evaluate,” says Isaac.

“In the moral domain, there’s no right and wrong,” adds Haas. “But it’s not by any means a free-for-all. There are better answers and there are worse answers.”

The researchers have identified several key challenges and suggested ways to address them. But it is more a wish list than a set of ready-made solutions. “They do a nice job of bringing together different perspectives,” says Vera Demberg, who studies LLMs at Saarland University in Germany.

A number of studies have shown that LLMs can show remarkable moral competence. One study published last year found that people in the US scored ethical advice from OpenAI’s GPT-4o as being more moral, trustworthy, thoughtful, and correct than advice given by the (human) writer of “The Ethicist,” a popular New York Times advice column.

The problem is that it is hard to unpick whether such behaviors are a performance—mimicking a memorized response, say—or evidence that there is in fact some kind of moral reasoning taking place inside the model. In other words, is it virtue or virtue signaling?

This question matters because multiple studies also show just how untrustworthy LLMs can be. For a start, models can be too eager to please. They have been found to flip their answer to a moral question and say the exact opposite when a person disagrees or pushes back on their first response. Worse, the answers an LLM gives to a question can change in response to how it is presented or formatted. For example, researchers have found that models quizzed about political values can give different—sometimes opposite—answers depending on whether the questions offer multiple-choice answers or instruct the model to respond in its own words.

In an even more striking case, Demberg and her colleagues presented several LLMs, including versions of Meta’s Llama 3 and Mistral, with a series of moral dilemmas and asked them to pick which of two options was the better outcome. The researchers found that the models often reversed their choice when the labels for those two options were changed from “Case 1” and “Case 2” to “(A)” and “(B).”

They also showed that models changed their answers in response to other tiny formatting tweaks, including swapping the order of the options and ending the question with a colon instead of a question mark.

In short, the appearance of moral behavior in LLMs should not be taken at face value. Models must be probed to see how robust that moral behavior really is. “For people to trust the answers, you need to know how you got there,” says Haas.

What Haas, Isaac, and their colleagues at Google DeepMind propose is a new line of research to develop more rigorous techniques for evaluating moral competence in LLMs. This would include tests designed to push models to change their responses to moral questions. If a model flipped its moral position, it would show that it hadn’t engaged in robust moral reasoning.

Another type of test would present models with variations of common moral problems to check whether they produce a rote response or one that’s more nuanced and relevant to the actual problem that was posed. For example, asking a model to talk through the moral implications of a complex scenario in which a man donates sperm to his son so that his son can have a child of his own might produce concerns about the social impact of allowing a man to be both biological father and biological grandfather to a child. But it should not produce concerns about incest, even though the scenario has superficial parallels with that taboo.

Haas also says that getting models to provide a trace of the steps they took to produce an answer would give some insight into whether that answer was a fluke or grounded in actual evidence. Techniques such as chain-of-thought monitoring, in which researchers listen in on a kind of internal monologue that some LLMs produce as they work, could help here too.

Another approach researchers could use to determine why a model gave a particular answer is mechanistic interpretability, which can provide small glimpses inside a model as it carries out a task. Neither chain-of-thought monitoring nor mechanistic interpretability provides perfect snapshots of a model’s workings. But the Google DeepMind team believes that combining such techniques with a wide range of rigorous tests will go a long way to figuring out exactly how far to trust LLMs with certain critical or sensitive tasks.

And yet there’s a wider problem too. Models from major companies such as Google DeepMind are used across the world by people with different values and belief systems. The answer to a simple question like “Should I order pork chops?” should differ depending on whether or not the person asking is vegetarian or Jewish, for example.

There’s no solution to this challenge, Haas and Isaac admit. But they think that models may need to be designed either to produce a range of acceptable answers, aiming to please everyone, or to have a kind of switch that turns different moral codes on and off depending on the user.

“It’s a complex world out there,” says Haas. “We will probably need some combination of those things, because even if you’re taking just one population, there’s going to be a range of views represented.”

“It’s a fascinating paper,” says Danica Dillion at Ohio State University, who studies how large language models handle different belief systems and was not involved in the work. “Pluralism in AI is really important, and it’s one of the biggest limitations of LLMs and moral reasoning right now,” she says. “Even though they were trained on a ginormous amount of data, that data still leans heavily Western. When you probe LLMs, they do a lot better at representing Westerners’ morality than non-Westerners’.”

But it is not yet clear how we can build models that are guaranteed to have moral competence across global cultures, says Demberg. “There are these two independent questions. One is: How should it work? And, secondly, how can it technically be achieved? And I think that both of those questions are pretty open at the moment.”

For Isaac, that makes morality a new frontier for LLMs. “I think this is equally as fascinating as math and code in terms of what it means for AI progress,” he says. “You know, advancing moral competency could also mean that we’re going to see better AI systems overall that actually align with society.”

Welcome to the dark side of crypto’s permissionless dream

Jean-Paul Thorbjornsen, an Australian man in his mid-30s, with a rural Catholic upbringing, is a founder of THORChain, a blockchain through which users can swap one cryptocurrency for another and earn fees from making those swaps.THORChain is permissionless, so anyone can use it without getting prior approval from a centralized authority. As a decentralized network, the blockchain is built and run by operators located across the globe. During its early days, Thorbjornsen himself hid behind the pseudonym “leena” and used an AI-generated female image as his avatar. But around March 2024, he revealed his true identity as the mind behind the blockchain. More or less.

If there is a central question around THORChain, it is this: Exactly who is responsible for its operations? It matters because in January last year, its users lost more than $200 million worth of their cryptocurrency in US dollars after THORChain transactions and accounts were frozen by a singular admin override, which users believed was not supposed to be possible given the decentralized structure.Thorbjornsen insists THORChain is helping realize bitcoin’s original purpose of enabling anyone to transact freely outside the reach of purportedly corrupt governments. Yet the network’s problems suggest that an alternative financial system might not be much better. Read the full story.

To be human is, fundamentally, to be a forecaster. Occasionally a pretty good one. Trying to see the future, whether through the lens of past experience or the logic of cause and effect, has helped us hunt, avoid being hunted, plant crops, forge social bonds, and in general survive in a world that does not prioritize our survival.

Today, we are awash in a sea of predictions so vast and unrelenting that most of us barely even register them. People’s desire for reliable forecasting is understandable. Still, nobody signed up for an omnipresent, algorithmic oracle mediating every aspect of their life. A trio of new books tries to make sense of our future-­focused world—how we got here, and what this change means. Each has its own prescriptions for navigating this new reality, but they all agree on one thing: Predictions are ultimately about power and control. Read the full story.

Hydrogen trains could revolutionize how Americans get aroundLike a mirage speeding across the dusty desert outside Pueblo, Colorado, the first hydrogen-fuel-cell passenger train in the United States is getting warmed up on its test track. It will soon be shipped to Southern California, where it is slated to carry riders on San Bernardino County’s Arrow commuter rail service before the end of the year.The best way to decarbonize railroads is the subject of growing debate among regulators, industry, and activists. The debate is partly technological, revolving around whether hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, or overhead electric wires offer the best performance for different railroad situations. But it’s also political: a question of the extent to which decarbonization can, or should, usher in a broader transformation of rail transportation.In the insular world of railroading, this hydrogen-powered train is a Rorschach test. To some, it represents the future of rail transportation. To others, it looks like a big, shiny distraction. Read the full story.

A trio of new books tries to make sense of our future-­focused world—how we got here, and what this change means. Each has its own prescriptions for navigating this new reality, but they all agree on one thing: Predictions are ultimately about power and control.

In The Means of Prediction: How AI Really Works (and Who Benefits), the Oxford economist Maximilian Kasy explains how most predictions in our lives are based on the statistical analysis of patterns in large, labeled data sets—what’s known in AI circles as supervised learning. Once “trained” on such data sets, algorithms for supervised learning can be presented with all kinds of new information and then deliver their best guess as to some specific future outcome. Will you violate your parole, pay off your mortgage, get promoted if hired, perform well on your college exams, be in your home when it gets bombed? More and more, our lives are shaped (and, yes, occasionally shortened) by a machine’s answer to these questions.

If the thought of a ubiquitous, mostly invisible predictive layer secretly grafted onto your life by a bunch of profit-hungry corporations makes you uneasy … well, same here. This arrangement is leading to a crueler, blander, more instrumentalized world, one where life’s possibilities are foreclosed, age-old prejudices are entrenched, and everyone’s brain seems to be actively turning into goo. It’s an outcome, according to Kasy, that was entirely predictable.

AI adherents might frame those consequences as “unintended,” or mere problems of optimization and alignment. Kasy, on the other hand, argues that they represent the system working as intended. “If an algorithm selecting what you see on social media promotes outrage, thereby maximizing engagement and ad clicks,” he writes, “that’s because promoting outrage is good for profits from ad sales.” The same holds true for an algorithm that nixes job candidates “who are likely to have family-care responsibilities outside the workplace,” and the ones that “screen out people who are likely to develop chronic health problems or disabilities.” What’s good for a company’s bottom line may not be good for your job-hunting prospects or life expectancy.

Where Kasy differs from other critics is that he doesn’t think working to create less biased, more equitable algorithms will fix any of this. Trying to rebalance the scales can’t change the fact that predictive algorithms rely on past data that’s often racist, sexist, and flawed in countless other ways. And, he says, the incentives for profit will always trump attempts to eliminate harm. The only way to counter this is with broad democratic control over what Kasy calls “the means of prediction”: data, computational infrastructure, technical expertise, and energy.

A little more than half of The Means of Prediction is devoted to explaining how this might be accomplished—through mechanisms including “data trusts” (collective public bodies that make decisions about how to process and use data on behalf of their contributors) and corporate taxing schemes that try to account for the social harm AI inflicts. There’s a lot of economist talk along the way, about how “agents of change” might help achieve “value alignment” in order to “maximize social welfare.” Reasonable, I guess, though a skeptic might point out that Kasy’s rigorous, systematic approach to building new public-serving institutions comes at a time when public trust in institutions has never been lower. Also, there’s the brain goo problem.

To his credit, Kasy is a realist here. He doesn’t presume that any of these proposals will be easy to implement. Or that it will happen overnight, or even in the near future. The troubling question at the end his book is: Do we have that kind of time?

Reading Kasy’s blueprint for seizing control of the means of prediction raises another pressing question. How on earth did we reach a point where machine-mediated prediction is more or less inescapable? Capitalism, might be Marx’s pithy response. Fine, as far as it goes, but that doesn’t explain why the same kinds of algorithms that currently model climate change are for some reason also deciding whether you get a new kidney or I get a car loan.

If you ask Benjamin Recht, author of The Irrational Decision: How We Gave Computers the Power to Choose for Us, he’d likely tell you our current predicament has a lot to do with the idea and ideology of decision theory—or what economists call rational choice theory. Recht, a polymathic professor in UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, prefers the term “mathematical rationality” to describe the narrow, statistical conception that stoked the desire to build computers, informed how they would eventually work, and influenced the kinds of problems they would be good at solving.

This belief system goes all the way back to the Enlightenment, but in Recht’s telling, it truly took hold at the tail end of World War II. Nothing focuses the mind on risk and quick decision-making like war, and the mathematical models that proved especially useful in the fight against the Axis powers convinced a select group of scientists and statisticians that they might also be a logical basis for designing the first computers. Thus was born the idea of a computer as an ideal rational agent, a machine capable of making optimal decisions by quantifying uncertainty and maximizing utility.

Intuition, experience, and judgment gave way, says Recht, to optimization, game theory, and statistical prediction. “The core algorithms developed in this period drive the automated decisions of our modern world, whether it be in managing supply chains, scheduling flight times, or placing advertisements on your social media feeds,” he writes. In this optimization-­driven reality, “every life decision is posed as if it were a round at an imaginary casino, and every argument can be reduced to costs and benefits, means and ends.”

Today, mathematical rationality (wearing its human skin) is best represented by the likes of the pollster Nate Silver, the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, and an assortment of Silicon Valley oligarchs, says Recht. These are people who fundamentally believe the world would be a better place if more of us adopted their analytic mindset and learned to weigh costs and benefits, estimate risks, and plan optimally. In other words, these are people who believe we should all make decisions like computers.

How might we demonstrate that (unquantifiable) human intuition, morality, and judgment are better ways of addressing some of the world’s most important and vexing problems?

It’s a ridiculous idea for multiple reasons, he says. To name just one, it’s not as if humans couldn’t make evidence-based decisions before automation. “Advances in clean water, antibiotics, and public health brought life expectancy from under 40 in the 1850s to 70 by 1950,” Recht writes. “From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, we had world-changing scientific breakthroughs in physics, including new theories of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity.” We also managed to build cars and airplanes without a formal system of rationality and somehow came up with societal innovations like modern democracy without optimal decision theory.

So how might we convince the Pinkers and Silvers of the world that most decisions we face in life are not in fact grist for the unrelenting mill of mathematical rationality? Moreover, how might we demonstrate that (unquantifiable) human intuition, morality, and judgment might be better ways of addressing some of the world’s most important and vexing problems?

One might start by reminding the rationalists that any prediction, computational or otherwise, is really just a wish—but one with a powerful tendency to self-fulfill. This idea animates Carissa Véliz’s wonderfully wide-ranging polemic Prophecy: Prediction, Power, and the Fight for the Future, from Ancient Oracles to AI.

A philosopher at the University of Oxford, Véliz sees a prediction as “a magnet that bends reality toward itself.” She writes, “When the force of the magnet is strong enough, the prediction becomes the cause of its becoming true.”

Take Gordon Moore. While he doesn’t come up in Prophecy, he does figure somewhat prominently in Recht’s history of mathematical rationality. A cofounder of the tech giant Intel, Moore is famous for his 1965 prediction that the density of transistors in integrated circuits would double every two years. “Moore’s Law” turned out to be true, and remains true today, although it does seem to be running out of steam thanks to the physical size limits of the silicon atom.

One story you can tell yourself about Moore’s Law is that Gordon was just a prescient guy. His now-classic 1965 opinion piece “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits,” for Electronics magazine, simply extrapolated what computing trends might mean for the future of the semiconductor industry.

Another story—the one I’m guessing Véliz might tell—is that Moore put an informed prediction out into the world, and an entire industry had a collective interest in making it come true. As Recht makes clear, there were and remain obvious financial incentives for companies to make faster and smaller computer chips. And while the industry has likely spent billions of dollars trying to keep Moore’s Law alive, it’s undoubtedly profited even more from it. Moore’s Law was a helluva strong magnet.

Predictions don’t just have a habit of making themselves come true, says Véliz. They can also distract us from the challenges of the here and now. When an AI boomer promises that artificial general intelligence will be the last problem humanity needs to solve, it not only shapes how we think about AI’s role in our lives; it also shifts our attention away from the very real and very pressing problems of the present day—problems that in many cases AI is causing.

In this sense, the questions around predictions (Who’s making them? Who has the right to make them?) are also fundamentally about power. It’s no accident, Véliz says, that the societies that rely most heavily on prediction are also the ones that tend toward oppression and authoritarianism. Predictions are “veiled prescriptive assertions—they tell us how to act,” she writes. “They are what philosophers call speech acts. When we believe a prediction and act in accordance with it, it’s akin to obeying an order.”

As much as tech companies would like us to believe otherwise, technology is not destiny. Humans make it and choose how to use it … or not use it. Maybe the most appropriate (and human) thing we can do in the face of all the uninvited daily predictions in our lives is to simply defy them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“We’re out of airspace now. We can do whatever we want,” Jean-Paul Thorbjornsen tells me from the pilot’s seat of his Aston Martin helicopter. As we fly over suburbs outside Melbourne, Australia, it’s becoming clear that doing whatever he wants is Thorbjornsen’s MO.

Upper-middle-class homes give way to vineyards, and Thorbjornsen points out our landing spot outside a winery. People visiting for lunch walk outside. “They’re going to ask for a shot now,” he says, used to the attention drawn by his luxury helicopter, emblazoned with the tail letters “BTC” for bitcoin (the price tag of $5 million in Australian dollars—$3.5 million in US dollars today—was perhaps reasonable for someone who claims a previous crypto project made more than AU$400 million, although he also says those funds were tied up in the company).

Thorbjornsen is a founder of THORChain, a blockchain through which users can swap one cryptocurrency for another and earn fees from making those swaps. THORChain is permissionless, so anyone can use it without getting prior approval from a centralized authority. As a decentralized network, the blockchain is built and run by operators located across the globe, most of whom use pseudonyms.

During its early days, Thorbjornsen himself hid behind the pseudonym “leena” and used an AI-generated female image as his avatar. But around March 2024, he revealed that he, an Australian man in his mid-30s, with a rural Catholic upbringing, was the mind behind the blockchain. More or less.

If there is a central question around THORChain, it is this: Exactly who is responsible for its operations? Blockchains as decentralized as THORChain are supposed to offer systems that operate outside the centralized leadership of corruptible governments and financial institutions. If a few people have outsize sway over this decentralized network—one of a handful that operate at such a large scale—it’s one more blemish on the legacy of bitcoin’s promise, which has already been tarnished by capitalistic political frenzy.

Who’s responsible for THORChain matters because in January last year, its users lost more than $200 million worth of their cryptocurrency in US dollars after THORChain transactions and accounts were frozen by a singular admin override, which users believed was not supposed to be possible given the decentralized structure. When the freeze was lifted, some users raced to pull their money out. The following month, a team of North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus Group used THORChain to move roughly $1.2 billion of stolen ethereum taken in the infamous hack of the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit.

Thorbjornsen explains away THORChain’s inability to stop the movement of stolen funds, or prevent a bank run, as a function of its decentralized and permissionless nature. The lack of executive powers means that anyone can use the network for any reason, and arguably there’s no one to hold accountable when even the worst goes down.

But when the worst did go down, nearly everyone in the THORChain community, and those paying attention to it in channels like X, pointed their fingers at Thorbjornsen. A lawsuit filed by the THORChain creditors who lost millions in January 2025 names him. A former FBI analyst and North Korea specialist, reflecting on the potential repercussions for helping move stolen funds, told me he wouldn’t want to be in Thorbjornsen’s shoes.

THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators, where two-thirds majority rules.

That’s why I traveled to Australia—to see if I could get a handle on where he sees himself and his role in relation to the network he says he founded.

According to Thorbjornsen, he should not be held responsible for either event. THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators—people with the computer power, and crypto stake, to run a cluster of servers that process the network’s transactions. In those votes, a two-thirds majority rules.

Then there’s the permissionless part. Anyone can use THORChain to make swaps, which is why it’s been a popular way for widely sanctioned entities such as the government of North Korea to move stolen money. This principle goes back to the cypherpunk roots of bitcoin, a currency that operates outside of nation-states’ rules. THORChain is designed to avoid geopolitical entanglements; that’s what its users like about it.

But there are distinct financial motivations for moving crypto, stolen or not: Node operators earn fees from the funds running through the network. In theory, this incentivizes them to act in the network’s best interests—and, arguably, Thorbjornsen’s interests too, as many assume his wealth is tied to the network’s profits. (Thorbjornsen says it is not, and that it comes instead from “many sources,” including “buying bitcoin back in 2013.”)

Now recent events have raised critical questions, not just about Thorbjornsen’s outsize role in THORChain’s operations, but also about the blockchain’s underlying nature.

If THORChain is decentralized, how was a single operator able to freeze its funds a month before the Bybit hack? Could someone have unilaterally decided to stop the stolen Bybit funds from coming through the network, and chosen not to?

Thorbjornsen insists THORChain is helping realize bitcoin’s original purpose of enabling anyone to transact freely outside the reach of purportedly corrupt governments. Yet the network’s problems suggest that an alternative financial system might not be much better.

On February 21, 2025, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou got an alarming call from the company’s chief financial officer. About $1.5 billion US of the exchange’s ethereum token, ETH, had been stolen.

The FBI attributed the theft to the Lazarus Group. Typically, criminals will want to convert ETH to bitcoin, which is much easier to convert in turn to cash. Knowing this, the FBI issued a public service announcement on February 26 to “exchanges, bridges … and other virtual asset service providers,” encouraging them to block transactions from accounts related to the hack.

Someone posted that announcement in THORChain’s private, invite-only developer channel on Discord, a chat app used widely by software engineers and gamers. While other crypto exchanges and bridges (which facilitate transactions across different blockchains) heeded the warning, THORChain’s node operators, developers, and invested insiders debated about whether or not to close the trading gates, a decision requiring a majority vote.

“Civil war is a very strong term, but there was a strong rift in the community,” says Boone Wheeler, a US-based crypto enthusiast. In 2021, Wheeler purchased some rune, THORChain’s Norse-mythology-themed native token, and he has been paid to write articles about the network to help advertise it. The rift formed “between people who wanted to stay permissionless,” he says, “and others who wanted to blacklist the funds.”

Wheeler, who says he doesn’t run a node or code for THORChain, fell on the side of remaining permissionless. However, others spoke up for blocking the transfers. THORChain, they argued, wasn’t decentralized enough to keep those running the network safe from law enforcement—especially when those operators were identifiable by their IP addresses, some based in the US.

“We are not the morality police,” someone with the username @Swing_Pop wrote on February 27 in the developer Discord.

THORChain’s design includes up to 120 nodes whose operators manage transactions on the network through a voting process. Anyone with hosting hardware can become an operator by funding nodes with rune as collateral, which provides the network with liquidity. Nodes can respond to a transaction by validating it or doing nothing. While individual transactions can’t be blocked, trading can be halted by a two-thirds majority vote.

Nodes are also penalized for not participating in voting, which the system labels as “bad behavior.” Every 2.5 days, THORChain automatically “churns” nodes out to ensure that no one node gains too much control. The nodes that chose not to validate transactions from the Bybit hack were automatically “churned” out of the system. Thorbjornsen says about 20 or 30 nodes were booted from the network in this way. (Node operators can run multiple nodes, and 120 are rarely running simultaneously; at the time of writing, 55 unique IDs operated 103 nodes.)

By February 27, some node operators were prepared to leave the network altogether. “It’s personally getting beyond my risk tolerance,” wrote @Runetard in the dev Discord. “Sorry to those of the community that feel otherwise. There are a bunch of us holding all the risk and some are getting ready to walk away.”

Even so, the financial incentive for the network operators who remained was significant. As one member of the dev Discord put it earlier that day, $3 million had been “extracted as commission” from the theft by those operating THORChain. “This is wrong!” they wrote.

Thorbjornsen weighed in on this back-and-forth, during which nodes paused and unpaused the network. He now says there was a right and wrong way for node operators to have behaved. “The correct way of doing things,” he says, was for node operators who opposed processing stolen funds to “go offline and … get [themselves] kicked out” rather than try to police who could use THORChain. He also says that while operators could discuss stopping transactions, “there was simply no design in the code that allowed [them] to do that.” However, a since-deleted post from his personal X account on March 3, 2025, stated: “I pushed for all my nodes to unhalt trading [keep trading]. Threatened to yank bond if they didn’t comply. Every single one.” (Thorbjornsen says his social media team ran this account in 2025.)

In an Australian 7 News Spotlight documentary last June, Thorbjornsen estimated that THORChain earned between $5 million and $10 million from the heist.

When asked in that same documentary if he received any of those fees, he replied, “Not directly.” When we spoke, I asked him to elaborate. He said he’s “not a recipient” of any funds THORChain sets aside for developers or marketers, nor does he operate any nodes. He was merely speaking generally, he told me: “All crypto holders profit indirectly off economic activity on any chain.”

Most important to Thorbjornsen was that, despite “huge pressure to shut the protocol down and stop servicing these swaps,” THORChain chugged along. He also notes that the hackers’ tactics, moving fast and splitting funds across multiple addresses, made it difficult to identify “bad swaps.”

Blockchain experts like Nick Carlsen, a former FBI analyst at the blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs, don’t buy this assessment. Other services similar to THORChain were identifying and rejecting these transactions. Had THORChain done the same, Carlsen adds, the stolen funds could have been contained on the Ethereum network, which “would have basically denied North Korea the ability to kick off this laundering process.”

And while THORChain touts its decentralization, in “practical applications” like the Lazarus Group’s theft, “most de-fi [decentralized finance] protocols are centralized,” says Daren Firestone, an attorney who represents crypto industry whistleblowers, citing a 2023 US Treasury Department risk assessment on illicit finance.

With centralization comes culpability, and in these cases, Firestone adds, that comes down to “who profits from [the protocol], so who creates it? But most importantly, who controls it?” Is there someone who can “hit an emergency off switch? … Direct nodes?”

Many answer these questions with Thorbjornsen’s name. “Everyone likes to pass the blame,” he says, even though he wasn’t alone in building THORChain. “​​In the end, it all comes back to me anyway.”

According to Thorbjornsen, his story goes like this.

The third of 10 homeschooled children in a “traditional” Catholic household in rural Australia, he spent his days learning math, reading, writing, and studying the Bible. As he got older, he was also responsible for instructing his younger siblings. Wednesday was his day to move the solar panels that powered their home. His parents “installed” a mango and citrus orchard, more to keep nine boys busy than to reap the produce, he says.

“We lived close to a local airfield,” Thorbjornsen says, “and I was always mesmerized by these planes.” He joined the Australian air force and studied engineering, but he says the military left him feeling like “a square peg in a round hole.” He adds that doing things his own way got him frequently “pulled aside” by superiors.

“That’s when I started looking elsewhere,” he says, and in 2013, he found bitcoin. It appealed because it existed “outside the system.”

During the 2017 crypto bull run, Thorbjornsen raised AU$12 million in an initial coin offering for CanYa, a decentralized marketplace he cofounded. CanYa ultimately “died” in 2018, and Thorbjornsen pivoted to a “decentralized liquidity” project that would become THORChain.

He worked with a couple of different developer teams, and then, in 2019, he clicked with an American developer, Chad Barraford, at a hackathon in Germany. Barraford (who declined to be interviewed for this story) was an early public face of THORChain.

Around this time, Thorbjornsen says, “a couple of us helped manage the payroll and early investment funds.” In a 2020 interview, Kai Ansaari, identified as a THORChain “project lead,” wrote, “We’re all contributors … There’s no real ‘lead,’ ‘CEO,’ ‘founder,’ etc.”

In interviews conducted since he came out from behind the “leena” account in 2024, Thorbjornsen has positioned himself as a key lead. He now says his plan had always been to hand over the account, along with command powers and control of THORChain social media accounts, once the blockchain had matured enough to realize its promise of decentralization.

In 2021, he says, he started this process, first by ceasing to use his own rune to back node operators who didn’t have enough to supply their own funding (this can be a way to influence node votes without operating a node yourself). That year, the protocol suffered multiple hacks that resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Nine Realms, a US-incorporated coding company, was brought on to take over THORChain’s development. Thorbjornsen says he passed “leena” over to “other community members” and “left crypto” in 2021, selling “a bunch of bitcoin” and buying the helicopter.

Despite this crypto departure, he came back onto the scene with gusto in 2024 when he revealed himself as the operator of the “leena” account. “​​For many years, I stayed private because I didn’t want the attention,” he says now.

By early 2024 Thorbjornsen considered the network to be sufficiently decentralized and began advertising it publicly. He started regularly posting videos on his TikTok and YouTube channels (“Two sick videos every week,” in the words of one caption) that showed him piloting his helicopter wearing shirts that read “Thor.”

By November 2024, Thorbjornsen, who describes himself as “a bit flamboyant,” was calling himself THORChain’s CEO (“chief energy officer”) and the “master of the memes” in a video from Binance Blockchain Week, an industry conference in Dubai. You need “strong memetic energy,” he says in the video, “to create the community, to create the cult.” Cults imply centralized leadership, and since outing himself as “leena,” Thorbjornsen has publicly appeared to helm the project, with one interviewer deeming him the “THORChain Satoshi” (an allusion to the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin).

One consequence of going public as a face of the protocol: He’s received death threats. “I stirred it up. Do I regret it? Who knows?” he said when we met in Australia. “It’s caused a lot of chaos.”

But, he added, “this is the bed that I’ve laid.” When we spoke again, months later, he backtracked, saying he “got sucked into” defending THORChain in 2024 and 2025 because he was involved from 2018 to 2021 and has “a perspective on how the protocol operates.”

Ryan Treat, a retired US Army veteran, woke up one morning in January 2025 to some disturbing activity on X. “My heart sank,” he says. THORFi, the THORChain program he’d used to earn interest on the bitcoin he’d planned to save for his retirement, had frozen all accounts—but that didn’t make sense.

THORFi featured a lending and saving program said to give users “complete control” and self-custody of their crypto, meaning they could withdraw it at any time.

Treat was no crypto amateur. He bought his first bitcoin at around “$5 apiece,” he says, and had always kept it off centralized exchanges that would maintain custody of his wallets. He liked THORChain because it claimed to be decentralized and permissionless. “I got into bitcoin because I wanted to have government-less money,” he says.

We were told it was decentralized. Then you wake up one morning and read this guy had an admin mimir.

Many who’d used THORFi lending and saving programs felt similarly. Users I interviewed differentiated THORChain from centralized lending platforms like BlockFi and Celsius, both of which offered extraordinarily high yields before filing for bankruptcy in 2022. “I viewed THORChain as a decentralized system where it was safer,” says Halsey Richartz, a Florida-based THORFi creditor, with “vanilla, 1% passive yield.” Indeed, users I spoke with hadn’t felt the need to monitor their THORFi deposits. “Only your key can be used to withdraw your funds,” the product’s marketing materials insisted. “Savers can withdraw their position to native assets at any time.”

So on January 9, when the “leena” account announced that an admin key had been used to pause withdrawals, it took THORFi users by surprise—and seemed to contradict the marketing messaging around decentralization. “We were told that it was decentralized, and you wake up one morning and read an article that says ‘This guy, JP, had an admin mimir,’” says Treat, referring to Thorbjornsen, “and I’m like, ‘What the fuck is an admin mimir?’”

The admin mimir was one of “a bunch of hard-coded admin keys built into the base code of the system,” says Jonathan Reiter, CEO of the blockchain intelligence company ChainArgos. Those with access to the keys had the ability to make executive decisions on the blockchain—a function many THORChain users didn’t realize could supersede the more democratic decisions made by node votes. These keys had been in THORChain’s code for years and “let you control just about anything,” Reiter adds, including the decision to pause the network during the hacks in 2021 that resulted in a loss of more than $16 million in assets.

Thorbjornsen says that one key was given to Nine Realms, while another was “shared around the original team.” He told me at least three people had them, adding, “I can neither confirm nor deny having access to that mimir key, because there’s no on-chain registry of the keys.”

Regardless of who had access, Thorbjornsen maintains that the admin mimir mechanism was “widely known within the community, and heavily used throughout THORChain’s history” and that any action taken using the keys “could be largely overruled by the nodes.” Indeed, nodes voted to open withdrawals back up shortly after the admin key was used to pause them. By then, those burned by THORFi argue, the damage had already been done. The executive pause to withdrawals, for some, signaled that something was amiss with THORFi. This led to a bank run after the pause was lifted, until the nodes voted to freeze withdrawals permanently (which Thorbjornsen had suggested in a since-deleted post on X), separating users from crypto worth around $200 million in US dollars on January 23. THORFi users were then offered a token called TCY (THORChain Yield), which they could claim with the idea that, when its price rose to $1, they would be made whole. (The price, as of writing, sits at $0.16.)

Who used the key? Thorbjornsen maintains he didn’t do it, but he claims he knows who did and won’t say. He says he’d handed over the “leena” account and doesn’t “have access to any of the core components of the system,” nor has he for “at least three years.” He implies that whoever controlled “leena” at the time used the admin key to pause network withdrawals.

A video released by Nine Realms on February 20, 2025, names Thorbjornsen as the activator of the key, stating, “JP ended up pausing lenders and savers, preventing withdrawals so that we can work out … [a] payback plan on them.” Thorbjornsen told me the video was “not factual.”

Multiple blockchain analysts told me it would be extremely difficult to determine who used the admin mimir key. A month after it was used to pause the network, THORChain said the key had been “removed from the network.” At least you can’t find the words “admin mimir” in THORChain’s base code; I’ve looked.

After the debacle of the THORFi withdrawal freeze, Richartz says, he tried to file reports with the Miami-Dade Police Department, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and Interpol. When we spoke in November, he still hadn’t been able to file with the city of Miami. They told him to try small claims court.

“I was like, no, you don’t understand … a post office box in Switzerland is the company address,” he says. “It underscored to me how little law enforcement even knows about these crimes.”

As for the Bybit hack, at least one government has retaliated against those who facilitate blockchain projects. Last April German authorities shut down eXch, an exchange suspected of using THORChain to process funds Lazarus stole from Bybit, says Julia Gottesman, cofounder and head of investigations at the cybersecurity group zeroShadow. Australia, she adds, where Thorbjornsen was based, has been “slow to try to engage with the crypto community, or any regulations.”

In response to requests for comment, Australia’s Department of Home Affairs wrote that at the end of March 2026, the country’s regulatory powers will expand to include “exchanges between the same type of cryptocurrency and transfers between different types.” They did not comment on specific investigations.

Crypto and finance experts disagree about whether THORChain engaged in money laundering, defined by the UN as “the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin.” But some think it fits the definition.

Shlomit Wagman, a Harvard fellow and former head of Israel’s anti-money-laundering agency and its delegation to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), thinks the Bybit activity was money laundering because THORChain helped the hackers “transfer the funds in an unsupervised manner, completely outside of the scope of regulated or supervised activity.”

And by helping with conversions, Carlsen says, THORChain enabled bad actors to turn stolen crypto into usable currency. “People like [Thorbjornsen] have a personal degree of culpability in sustaining the North Korean government,” he says. Thorbjornsen counters that THORChain is “open-source infrastructure.”

Meanwhile, just days after the hack, Bybit issued a 10% bounty on any funds recovered. As of mid-January this year, between $100 million and $500 million worth of those funds in US dollars remain unaccounted for, according to Gottesman of zeroShadow, which was hired by Bybit to recover funds following the hack.

For Thorbjornsen, it’s just another day at the casino. That’s the comparison he made during his regrettable 7 News Spotlight interview about the Bybit heist, and he repeated it when we met. “You go to a casino, you play a few games, you expect to lose,” he told me. “When you do actually go to zero, don’t cry.”

Thorbjornsen, it should be noted, has lost at the casino himself.

In September, he says, he got a Telegram message from a friend, inviting him to a Zoom meeting. He accepted and participated in a call with people who had “American voices.”

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who’s had a bad year, fending off “threat vectors” left and right.

After the meeting, Thorbjornsen learned that his friend’s Telegram had been hacked. Whoever was responsible had used the Zoom link to remotely install software on Thorbjornsen’s computer, which “got access to everything”—his email, his crypto wallets, a bitcoin-based retirement fund. It cost him at least $1.2 million. The blockchain sleuth known as ZachXBT traced the funds and attributed the hack to North Korea.

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who’s had a bad year. He says he had to liquidate his crypto assets because he’s dealing with the fallout of a recent divorce. He also feels he is fending off “threat vectors” left and right. More than once, he asked if I was a private investigator masquerading as a journalist.

Still, his many contradictions don’t inspire confidence. He doesn’t have any more crypto assets, he says. However, the crypto wallet he shared with me so I could pay him back for lunch showed that it contained assets worth more than $143,000 in US dollars. He now says it wasn’t his wallet. He says he doesn’t control THORChain’s social media, but he’d also told me that he runs the @THORChain X account (later backtracking and saying the account is “delegated” to him for trickier questions).

He insists that he does not care about money. He says that in the robot future, the AI-powered hive mind will become our benevolent overlord, rendering money obsolete, so why give it much thought? Yet as we flew back from the vineyard, he pointed out his new house from the helicopter. It resembles a compound. He says he lives there with his new wife.

Multiple people I spoke with about Thorbjornsen before I met him warned me he wasn’t trustworthy, and he’s undeniably made fishy statements. For instance, the presence of a North Korean flag in a row of decals on the tail of his helicopter suggested an affinity with the country for which THORChain has processed so much crypto. Thorbjornsen insists he had requested the flag of Australia’s Norfolk Island, calling the mix-up “a complete coincidence.” The flags were gone by the time of our flight, apparently removed during a recent repair.

“Money is a meme,” he says. “Money does not exist.” Meme or not, it’s had real repercussions for those who have interacted with THORChain, and those who wound up losing have been looking for someone to blame.

When I spoke with Thorbjornsen again in January, he appeared increasingly concerned that he is that someone. He’s spending more time in Singapore, he told me. Singapore happens to have historically denied extraditions to the US for money-laundering prosecutions.

The curious case of the disappearing Lamborghinis

Across the world, unsuspecting people are unwittingly becoming caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft.Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination before using a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.The nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere

Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050.

Bioengineer and computational biologist César de la Fuente has a plan. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments—and his quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. Read the full story.

In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly. Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Sam Zahr first saw the gray Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible with orange interior and orange roof, he knew he’d found a perfect addition to his fleet. “It was very appealing to our clientele,” he told me. As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.

But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.

His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.

Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.

Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.

“He’s like, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.

Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.

“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”

Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.

These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.

Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”

But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.

When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1 billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.

Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told MIT Technology Review that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)

“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”

Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35 billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.

NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.

“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.

Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”

In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.

The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”

The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.

In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.

The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.

A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.

“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)

As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast Auto Transport Co-Pilot, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.

The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.

“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”

Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told MIT Technology Review that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)

Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”

As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.

After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.

On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.

“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.

Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.

“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by MIT Technology Review. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”

Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.

The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)

The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.

That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.

The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.

The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.

Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.

“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”

The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.

That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.

“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”

The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)

As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.

It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.

It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.

The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.

In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.

Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.

Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.

“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.

Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.

Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.

No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.

“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.

That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.

On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.

Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.

On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.

Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.

One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)

Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.

It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.

“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.

An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.

The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.

“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.

Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.

Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”

Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.

That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.

“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the Auto Remarketing Podcast. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”

Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”

Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.

“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”

It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)

In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.

Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.

Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.

“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.

            <h2>Mistral AI buys cloud startup Koyeb</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.

            <div id="article-text">Venture capital has long avoided ‘hard’ sectors such as government, defence, energy, manufacturing, and hardware, viewing them as uninvestable because startups have limited scope to challenge incumbents. Instead, investors have prioritised fast-moving and lightly regulated software markets with lower barriers to entry.

End users in these hard industries have paid the price, as a lack of innovation funding has left them stuck with incumbent providers that continue to deliver clunky, unintuitive solutions that are difficult to migrate from.

However, that perception is now shifting. Investors are responding to new market dynamics within complex industries and the evolving methods startups are using to outperform incumbents.

Government technology spending more than doubled between 2021 and 2025, while defence technology more than doubled in 2025 alone, and we see similar trends in robotics, industrial technology, and healthcare.  This signals a clear change in investor mindset as AI-first approaches are changing adoption cycles.

Historically, those sectors had been viewed as incompatible with venture capital norms: slow procurement cycles, strict regulation, heavy operational and capital requirements, as well as deep integration into physical systems.

For example, on a global level, public procurement can take years, constrained by budgeting cycles, legislation and accountability frameworks. Energy projects must comply with regulatory regimes and national permitting structures, and infrastructure and hardware deployments require extensive certification and long engineering cycles.

Government and public-sector buyers also tend to prioritise reliability, compliance, track record, and legacy relationships over speed, meaning major contracts often go to incumbents rather than startups. Similar dynamics exist in construction, mining, logistics, and manufacturing, all sectors that are still dominated by legacy vendors, complex supply chains, and thin operational margins.

That view is now changing. Capital is increasingly flowing into sectors once seen as too bureaucratic or operationally complex. Beyond those headline sectors, construction tech, industrial automation, logistics software, healthcare, and public-sector tooling are attracting record levels of early-stage and growth capital.

The key question is: what is driving this shift in investor thinking?

The shift in investor priorities is partly driven by macro and geopolitical pressures. Supply-chain disruption, energyinsecurity and infrastructure fragility have elevated industrial resilience to a national priority. Governments are investing heavily in grid modernisation, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure, while public institutions face mounting pressure to digitise procurement, compliance, and workflow systems.

What were once considered slow, bureaucratic markets are now seen as structurally supported by policy and long-term demand.

AI is the driving force and is reshaping traditionally hard industries. By lowering the cost of building sophisticated software and enabling immediate performance gains with shorter adoption cycles, AI allows startups to compete with incumbents in sectors such as construction, mining, manufacturing, logistics, and public services from day one.

As software becomes easier to replicate, defensibility is shifting toward operational depth, substantial UI/UX improvements, speed to market, and more seamless integration into complex real-world systems.

Finally, saturation in horizontal SaaS has pushed investors to look elsewhere for differentiated returns. Crowded softwarecategories offer diminishing breakout potential and are often threatened by OpenAI and Anthropic’s fast pace of innovation, whereas regulated and infrastructure-heavy sectors provide less competition, stronger pricing power, higher switching costs, and gigantic TAMs.

SAP with a $200B cap is just an example, but the same goes for Caterpillar, Siemens, Big Utilities, Big Pharma, and many others.

Regulation, once viewed as a deterrent, is increasingly understood as a moat. Startups that successfully navigate procurement frameworks, compliance regimes, and industry standards build advantages that are difficult for new entrants to replicate and cannot be vibe-coded.

Legacy players, while trying to adopt new AI tooling as quickly as they can, still struggle to adapt their workflows and scale innovation as quickly as younger companies can. Their dominance has relied on the high cost of switching away from their solutions, but as attention and investment shift toward hard sectors, incumbents can no longer rely solely on their brand reputation.

Even industry leaders like Salesforce are relying more on acquisitions to keep up, showing how new technology and easier alternatives are lowering switching costs and making it harder for established companies to hold onto customers.

Startups are also increasingly being built by innovative industry specialists, who aren’t confined by the same limitations as legacy players. Many startup founders in defence, energy, healthcare, and government procurement come directly from these industries or have unique insights into their inner weaknesses.

The next wave of disruption will hit legacy companies hard, as startups prove they can innovate with the speed, flexibilityand focus that incumbents often lack. In sectors long protected by regulation or procurement friction, younger companiesare demonstrating that modern software, AI, and new business models can unlock performance improvements that established players struggle to match. Investor playbooks are already evolving, and that shift will likely accelerate in the year ahead.

At the same time, the total addressable market ceiling has been lifted. By moving beyond narrow software categories and into the physical economy, startups are targeting markets measured not in billions, but in trillions. As a result, we should expect more $100 billion companies to be built in this cycle. It’s no longer just about building better software.

It’s about rebuilding foundational sectors of the global economy.

            <h2>The European Parliament pulls back AI from its own devices</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-european-parliament-pulls-back-ai-from-its-own-devices">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has taken a rare and telling step: it has disabled built-in artificial intelligence features on work devices used by lawmakers and staff, citing unresolved concerns about data security, privacy, and the opaque nature of cloud-based AI processing.

The decision, communicated to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in an internal memo this week, reflects a deepening unease at the heart of European institutions about how AI systems handle sensitive data.

The Parliament’s IT department concluded that it could not guarantee the safety of certain AI-driven functions, notably writing assistants, text summarization tools, virtual assistants, and web page summary features, because they rely on cloud-based processing that sends data off the device.

In a workplace where draft legislation, confidential correspondence, and internal deliberations circulate daily, even momentary exposure of sensitive information is viewed as unacceptable.

For now, the measures apply only to these native, built-in AI features on Parliament-issued tablets and smartphones, not to everyday apps like email or calendars. The institution has declined to specify which operating systems or device manufacturers are affected, citing the “sensitive nature” of cybersecurity matters.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The internal memo did more than announce a software rollback. It advised lawmakers to review AI settings on their personal phones and tablets, warning them against exposing work emails, documents, or internal information to AI tools that “scan or analyze content,” and urging caution with third-party AI applications that seek broad access to data.

This guidance implicitly acknowledges a larger truth: for many elected officials and staff, the boundary between official and personal devices is porous. The Parliament’s approach underscores that risks are not confined to issued hardware but extend into the consumer technology choices of its own members.

The move is the latest in a series of precautionary steps by EU institutions. In 2023 the Parliament banned the use of TikTok on staff devices over similar data concerns, and ongoing debates have questioned the use of foreign-developed productivity software. Some lawmakers have even suggested moving away from Microsoft products in favor of European alternatives, part of a broader push for digital sovereignty.

That push is not abstract. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework on AI, has been in force since 2024 and imposes obligations on AI providers and users alike, categorizing systems by risk and demanding transparency, traceability, and human oversight.

Yet the Parliament’s latest action reveals a paradox: while Europe seeks to regulate and shape AI at scale, it is simultaneously wary of the very tools it aims to master. Stopping short of a full ban on AI use, the institution is essentially saying that in certain contexts, the technology is too unpredictable to trust, especially when critical information could leak outside secure boundaries.

The Parliament’s decision may seem narrowly targeted, but it carries broader implications. It signals that even for progressive regulators who have championed innovation alongside rights protections, the practical limits of AI integration are now a central concern. Cybersecurity teams within government institutions are not merely technologists; they are custodians of trust in an era when data is both an asset and a vulnerability.

For businesses and citizens watching Europe’s regulatory trajectory, this episode is instructive. It suggests that the EU’s approach to AI will not only be legal and ethical but deeply pragmatic. Regulations may promote responsible innovation, but European institutions are prepared to pull back when security and control are at stake.

As AI capabilities continue to evolve and become embedded in devices worldwide, the Parliament’s cautionary step highlights a core tension of the digital age: balancing the potential of AI with its unseen and unquantified risks.

Whether other governments follow suit, or whether this stance influences corporate and product strategy, remains to be seen. In the meantime, the message from Brussels is unmistakable: when it comes to AI and sensitive data, trust but verify is no longer enough.

            <h2>AI FOMO: Where the “I” is not just intelligence, but I, the human</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When FOMO ( fear of missing out) first entered popular language, it was about teenagers scrolling through friends’ social feeds and worrying they weren’t having as much fun. But today, that word has taken on a different meaning in the era of artificial intelligence.

The fear now isn’t about beach photos or party snapshots. It’s about being left behind in a technological revolution that promises dramatic changes in work, creativity, and competition. It’s about the feeling that your own intelligence is not enough anymore, and you can’t compete with the artificial one.

You might call it AI FOMO, the worry, for individuals and companies alike, that others are moving ahead with AI while you stand still. And this feeling is real enough that researchers are trying to understand it scientifically.

They’ve developed tools to measure how much people fear falling behind in AI skills or access. A recent study showing how this fear plays out found that more than one in nine adults report elevated levels of anxiety about not keeping up with AI, especially younger people and women. Importantly, those with better AI literacy reported less fear, suggesting that understanding the technology reduces anxiety.

This isn’t abstract psychological jargon. It is a psychological undercurrent that feels entirely modern: tied to the ubiquity of AI in press, policy, and venture capital. The sense that everyone must adopt intelligent technology or risk irrelevance. But like most anxieties, its influence extends far beyond individual nervousness.

I think we reached the point where AI FOMO is shaping business decisions, corporate strategy, and even public policy.

The ripples from AI FOMO extend far beyond individual stress. They reach into boardrooms and strategic plans where companies, whether big or small, are deciding how hard to pursue AI.

A survey by intelligent automation company ABBYY found that around 60-70 % of technology leaders report fear of missing out as a major reason their organisation is investing in AI. Many worry that if they don’t adopt AI now, competitors will seize an advantage. And together with the leaders’ fear, some decisions are coming that may affect the employees.

I will give credit. That fear can feel logical. After all, AI promises efficiency, insight, and new capabilities, even for thought less capable.

But when fear becomes the main reason for action, it warps strategy. Rather than asking “What problem are we solving with AI?”, decision-makers ask “Can we afford not to use AI?” This change from thoughtful problem-solving to panic-driven adoption creates an illusion of purpose where there may be none.

And the results can be underwhelming. Recent business surveys show that many companies are still struggling to see real returns from their AI investments. Some executives report that less than half of their AI projects deliver measurable impact, or struggle to even quantify it. That’s a sign that widespread adoption does not automatically translate into value, especially when the impetus to buy in comes from anxiety rather than strategy.

AI FOMO isn’t just a corporate phenomenon. It affects workers too. Research focused on attitudes in the workplace shows that employees who believe AI will reduce their autonomy or make their skills obsolete tend to experience fear of missing out on AI adoption alongside heightened job anxiety. This connects with broader concerns about technology and wellbeing at work: many people worry that AI might replace tasks or change job expectations without clarity.

That fear can influence behaviour, too. Anecdotal reports, such as research showing a significant share of workers using AI tools secretly to keep up with perceived expectations, reflect this sense of needing to keep pace, even in silence. It’s not just about skills; it’s about identity, worth, and belonging in a professional world that is moving so fast.

The result is a kind of feedback loop. Investment without strategy, momentum without direction. In the pursuit of not falling behind, many risk falling into the very inefficiency they hoped to avoid.

To navigate this moment with equanimity requires resisting the gravitational pull of fear. This is not a rejection of AI’s transformative potential. A large majority of business leaders still view AI as an opportunity, even as concerns about risk and readiness grow.

But recognising AI FOMO as a real force, not just a catchphrase, allows companies, governments, and individuals to ask better questions:

The answer, ultimately, is not to replace fear with oblivious optimism, but to replace reflexive action with intentional adoption.

In the end, AI FOMO tells us something deeper about ourselves than any quarterly earnings report or headline about the next breakthrough. It reveals how closely we have tied our hopes, and our anxieties, to a technology that is, for many of us, still only partly understood.

We see AI everywhere: pitched as productivity’s savior one moment, feared as a job-eating force the next. Across workplaces and dinner-table conversations alike, even on dating apps, the underlying emotion often isn’t excitement or dread alone, but something that feels curiously familiar and deeply human: the fear of falling behind, of being outpaced by peers, competitors, or even young strangers we’ve never met.

This feeling is more than a distraction or a fancy word. It is linked to genuine stress, anxiety, and reduced well-being for some, and it shapes behaviour in subtle but far-reaching ways. People tweak their resumes, accept rushed technology rollouts, or hunch over training modules long into the night; not because they are certain of the value, but because they fear the alternative.

This moment, then, feels like more than a fad. It is a crossroads between reaction and reflection. We can choose to let fear drive our choices, or we can treat that fear as a signal to slow down, learn, and make room for real understanding.

If I’ve learned anything in the years since AI leapt into the popular imagination, it’s this: technology changes fastest when we pair curiosity with clarity, and adapts most successfully when we meet it with empathy rather than anxiety.

So as the next wave of models arrives, as companies wordsmith their AI strategies, and as employees juggle training modules alongside tools and dashboards, here’s one gentle reminder worth holding onto: technology doesn’t define us. Our reactions to it do. We are the ones who imagine, experiment, hesitate, question, and decide.
