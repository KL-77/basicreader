            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Out beyond the orbit of Neptune lies an expansive ring of ancient relics, dynamical enigmas, and possibly a hidden planet—or two.

The Kuiper Belt, a region of frozen debris about 30 to 50 times farther from the sun than the Earth is—and perhaps farther, though nobody knows—has been shrouded in mystery since it first came into view in the 1990s.

Over the past 30 years, astronomers have cataloged about 4,000 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), including a smattering of dwarf worlds, icy comets, and leftover planet parts. But that number is expected to increase tenfold in the coming years as observations from more advanced telescopes pour in. In particular, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will illuminate this murky region with its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which began operating last year. Other next-generation observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will also help to bring the belt into focus.

“Beyond Neptune, we have a census of what’s out there in the solar system, but it’s a patchwork of surveys, and it leaves a lot of room for things that might be there that have been missed,” says Renu Malhotra, who serves as Louise Foucar Marshall Science Research Professor and Regents Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona.

“I think that’s the big thing that Rubin is going to do—fill out the gaps in our knowledge of the contents of the solar system,” she adds. “It’s going to greatly advance our census and our knowledge of the contents of the solar system.”

As a consequence, astronomers are preparing for a flood of discoveries from this new frontier, which could shed light on a host of outstanding questions. Are there new planets hidden in the belt, or lurking beyond it? How far does this region extend? And are there traces of cataclysmic past encounters between worlds—both homegrown or from interstellar space—imprinted in this largely pristine collection of objects from the deep past?

“I think this will become a very hot field very soon, because of LSST,” says Amir Siraj, a graduate student at Princeton University who studies the Kuiper Belt.

The Kuiper Belt is a graveyard of planetary odds and ends that were scattered far from the sun during the messy birth of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. Pluto was the first KBO ever spotted, more than a half-century before the belt itself was discovered.

Since the 1990s, astronomers have found a handful of other dwarf planets in the belt, such as Eris and Sedna, along with thousands of smaller objects. While the Kuiper Belt is not completely static, it is, for the most part, an intact time capsule of the early solar system that can be mined for clues about planet formation.

For example, the belt contains weird structures that may be signatures of past encounters between giant planets, including one particular cluster of objects, known as a “kernel,” located at about 44 astronomical units (AU), where one AU is the distance between Earth and the sun (about 93 million miles).

While the origin of this kernel is still unexplained, one popular hypothesis is that its constituent objects—which are known as cold classicals—were pulled along by Neptune’s outward migration through the solar system more than 4 billion years ago, which may have been a bumpy ride.

The idea is that “Neptune got jiggled by the rest of the gas giants and did a bit of a jump; it’s called the ‘jumping Neptune’ scenario,” says Wes Fraser, an astronomer at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, National Research Council of Canada, who studies the Kuiper Belt, noting that astronomer David Nesvorný came up with the idea.

“Imagine a snowplow driving along a highway, and lifting up the plow. It leaves a clump of snow behind,” he adds. “That same sort of idea is what left the clump of cold classicals behind. That is the kernel.”

In other words, Neptune tugged these objects along with it as it migrated outward, but then broke its gravitational hold over them when it “jumped,” leaving them to settle into the Kuiper Belt in the distinctive Neptune-sculpted kernel pattern that remains intact to this day.

Last year, Siraj and his advisers at Princeton set out to look for other hidden structures in the Kuiper Belt with a new algorithm that analyzed 1,650 KBOs—about 10 times as many objects as the 2011 study, led by Jean-Robert Petit, that first identified the kernel.

The results consistently confirmed the presence of the original kernel, while also revealing a possibly new “inner kernel” located at about 43 AU, though more research is needed to confirm this finding, according to the team’s 2025 study.

“You have these two clumps, basically, at 43 and 44 AU,” Siraj explains. “It’s unclear whether they’re part of the same structure,” but “either way, it’s another clue about, perhaps, Neptune’s migration, or some other process that formed these clumps.”

As Rubin and other telescopes discover thousands more KBOs in the coming years, the nature and possible origin of these mysterious structures in the belt may become clearer, potentially opening new windows into the tumultuous origins of our solar system.

In addition to reconstructing the early lives of the known planets, astronomers who study the Kuiper Belt are racing to spot unknown planets. The most famous example is the hypothetical giant world known as Planet Nine or Planet X, first proposed in 2016. Some scientists have suggested that the gravitational influence of this planet, if it exists, might explain strangely clustered orbits within the Kuiper Belt, though this speculative world would be located well beyond the belt, at several hundred AU.

Siraj and his colleagues have also speculated about the possibility of a Mercury- or Mars-sized world, dubbed Planet Y, that may be closer to the belt, at around 80 to 200 AU, according to their 2025 study. Rubin is capable of spotting these hypothetical worlds, though it may be challenging to anticipate the properties of planets that lurk this far from the sun.

“We know nothing about the atmospheres and surfaces of gas giant or ice giant type planets at 200, 300, or 400 AU,” Fraser says. “We know nothing about their chemistry. Every single time we look at an exoplanet, it behaves differently than what our models predict.”

“I think Planet Nine might very well just be a tar ball that is so dark that we can’t see it, and that’s why it hasn’t been discovered yet,” he adds. “If we found that, I wouldn’t be too surprised. And who knows what an Earth [in the belt] would look like? Certainly the compositional makeup will be different than a Mars, or an Earth, or a Venus, in the inner solar system.”

Observatories like Rubin and JWST may fill in these tantalizing gaps in our knowledge of the Kuiper Belt, and perhaps pinpoint hidden planets. But even if these telescopes reveal an absence of planets, it would be a breakthrough.

“There’s a lot of room for discovery of large bodies,” says Malhotra. “That would be awesome, but if we don’t find any, that would tell us something as well.”

“Not finding them up to some distance would give us estimates of how efficient or inefficient the planet formation process was,” she adds. “It would fill in some of the uncertainties that we have in our models.”

One other major open question about the Kuiper Belt is the extent of its boundaries. The belt suddenly tapers off at about 50 AU, an edge called the Kuiper cliff. This is a puzzling feature, because it suggests that our solar system has an anomalously small debris belt compared with other systems.

“The solar system looks kind of weird,” Fraser says. “The Kuiper cliff is a somewhat sharp delineation. Beyond that, we have no evidence that there was a disk of material. And yet, if you look at other stellar systems that have debris disks, the vast majority of those are significantly larger.”

“If we were to find a debris disk at, say, 100 AU, that would immediately make the solar system not weird, and quite average at that point,” he notes.

In 2024, Fraser and his colleagues presented hints of a possible undiscovered population of objects that may exist at about 100 AU—though he emphasizes that these are candidate detections, and are not yet confirmed to be a hidden outer ring.

However, even Rubin may not be able to resolve the presence of the tiny and distant objects that could represent a new outer limit of the Kuiper Belt. Time will tell.

As astronomers gear up for this major step change in our understanding of the Kuiper Belt, answers to some of our most fundamental questions hang in the balance. With its immaculate record of the early solar system, this region preserves secrets from the deep past. Here there are probably not dragons, but there may well be hidden planets, otherworldly structures, and discoveries that haven’t yet been imagined.

“I’d say the big question is, what’s out there?” Malhotra says. “What are we missing?”

            <h2>WHO slams US-funded newborn vaccine trial as "unethical"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/who-slams-us-funded-newborn-vaccine-trial-as-unethical/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The World Health Organization on Friday released a formal statement blasting a US-funded vaccine trial as “unethical,” because it would withhold an established, safe, and potentially lifesaving vaccine against hepatitis B from some newborns in Guinea-Bissau, Africa.

“In its current form, and based on publicly available information, the trial is inconsistent with established ethical and scientific principles,” the WHO concluded, after providing a bullet-point list of reasons the trial was harmful and low quality.

The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since notice of the US funding was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—had awarded $1.6 million to Danish researchers for their non-competitive, unsolicited proposal to conduct the trial.

The Danish researchers are led by Christine Stabell Benn and her husband Peter Aaby of the Bandim Health Project, which is based at the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen. Benn and her colleagues have long been controversial for their questionable practices in research into alleged vaccine safety concerns. Kennedy has cited their work in his decision to cut global vaccine funding.

The CDC’s funding of Benn’s hepatitis B vaccine trial also came soon after the agency’s advisors—who were handpicked by Kennedy—decided to abandon a long-standing universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine birth dose. The move was widely decried by health experts.

In the Guinea-Bissau trial, Benn’s team intended to randomize 14,000 newborns to receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at either birth or at six weeks, and then study differences in alleged safety outcomes. Currently, Guinea-Bissau gives the first vaccine dose at the six-week point, but has already decided to transition to recommend a birth dose in 2028. The reason for the delayed implementation is resource constraints.

“Exploiting scarcity is not ethical,” the WHO wrote in its statement today.

The United Nations health agency highlighted that the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose is “an effective, and essential public health intervention” that has “been used for over three decades, with more than 115 countries including it in their national schedules. “

“It prevents life‑threatening liver disease by stopping mother‑to‑child transmission at birth,” the WHO wrote, noting that more than 12 percent of adults in Guinea-Bissau have chronic hepatitis B.

In a section subtitled “Why withholding the vaccine is unethical,” the WHO lays out all the reasons the trial is dangerous.

“From what is publicly described, the [trial] protocol does not appear to ensure even a minimum level of harm reduction and benefit to the study participants (e.g., screening pregnant women and vaccinating newborns exposed to hepatitis B),” the WHO wrote.

As a proven lifesaving vaccine, withholding it from some study participants would expose newborns to serious and potentially irreversible harm, including chronic infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, the WHO argues. There is no scientific justification for withholding a proven intervention, and there is no credible evidence of the safety concerns that Benn and her colleagues claim to be looking for in their trial. The WHO also noted that the publicly available information about the trial indicates that it will be a single-blind, no-treatment-controlled design, which “raises a significant likelihood of substantial risk of bias, limiting interpretability of the study results and their policy relevance.”

As of now, the trial appears to be suspended. Nature News reported that in a January 22 press conference, health officials in Guinea-Bissau said that a technical and ethical review was pending. “There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau, said. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.”

Previously, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that the trial would not go forward. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services provided a statement saying that it was “proceeding as planned.”</div>

            <h2>Aided by AI, California beach town broadens hunt for bike lane blockers</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/santa-monica-deploys-ai-powered-parking-cameras-to-protect-bike-lanes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This spring, a Southern California beach town will become the first city in the country where municipal parking enforcement vehicles will use an AI system looking for potential bike lane violations.

Beginning in April, the City of Santa Monica will bring Hayden AI’s scanning technology to seven cars in its parking enforcement fleet, expanding beyond similar cameras already mounted on city buses.

“The more we can reduce the amount of illegal parking, the safer we can make it for bike riders,” Charley Territo, chief growth officer at Hayden AI, told Ars.

Hayden AI’s bus cameras, designed to detect bike lane and bus zone violations, currently exist in two other California cities: Oakland and Sacramento. The company also has installations around the country, including New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. In September 2025, the company announced that it had installed 2,000 systems on buses worldwide.

Late last year, over a 59-day period, Hayden AI also said its technology detected over 1,100 parking violations at the University of California, San Diego—and 88 percent of those were instances of blocking a bike lane.

Hayden AI says it sells its product to municipalities and related entities to not only increase bus speed (by removing obstructions) but also improve safety.

“We do that by [reducing] one of the biggest causes of collisions with buses—moving out of their lanes,” Territo added. “So the fewer times they have to make a turn, the fewer instances there are [of a crash].”

As part of its setup process, the San Francisco-based startup says that it begins any installation by first mapping a city. Then it teaches the AI the local parking enforcement rules. Typically, those rules say that cars can’t block a bike or bus lane. Traditionally, Hayden AI’s cameras have only been mounted on buses, so enforcement was limited to existing routes.

“We tell our system that if you see a vehicle that encroaches on a bike lane, capture a 10-second video and the license plate of that vehicle,” Territo said.

“From there, an evidence package goes to the [police] and they will review and verify the elements—that a prosecutable violation exists—and then they will issue a violation under [state law]. If there is no violation, the system doesn’t capture any data. The system is only looking for scenarios where a bike lane is blocked and a license plate is evident.”

Local bike advocates have applauded this expansion of automated enforcement.

“Enforcement cannot be everywhere at once. If we can extend their arm so these things can get done, and keep our community safe, that is a win,” Cynthia Rose, the director of Santa Monica Spoke, told Ars. While warning of the potential misuse of bulk data collection in general, Rose was on board with Hayden AI’s particular plan.

“Anywhere where there’s bike infrastructure, where I know of, [blocking the lane] is a problem,” Rose said. “It’s tantamount to parking in handicapped zones. It’s just a flat no.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Verizon this week imposed a new roadblock for people who want to pay off device installment plans early in order to get their phones unlocked. The latest version of Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off their device installment plan online or in the Verizon app.

Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store.

Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on another network, letting customers switch from one carrier to another. Previously, the 35-day waiting period for unlocks was only applied when a customer paid off the plan with a Verizon gift card.

“If you payoff [sic] a device payment agreement balance online or in the My Verizon App, or if a Verizon Gift Card is used to purchase a smartphone or pay off a remaining balance, the unlocking process will be delayed by 35 days,” the current version of the policy says. “This window allows for the verification of the gift card’s funds to ensure they were not obtained through fraudulent or illegal means.”

The paragraph above only explains why the waiting period is necessary for gift-card payments despite applying the 35-day wait to online and app payments as well. In a previous version of the policy that was implemented on January 27 and still in place as of February 9, the 35-day waiting period applied only when a Verizon gift card is used to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance.

The 35-day waiting period provision was changed to include online and app payments by February 11. We were made aware of the most recent change thanks to a tip from Ars forum member User_E.

Despite the significant update that happened this week, Verizon still lists the effective date of the device unlocking policy as January 27. It thus appears that Verizon is applying the 35-day wait after online and app payments retroactively, without disclosing that the policy changed after January 27.

The 35-day waiting period seems to apply regardless of how long the phone has been in use. For example, if you were 18 months into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and decided to pay the remaining balance early and switch carriers, you’d still have to wait 35 days for an unlock in most scenarios.

A Verizon spokesperson told Ars today that customers meeting the requirements for a quick unlock will “typically” receive it within 24 hours. But “if you pay online, through the app, or use a ‘non-secure’ method (like a Verizon Gift Card, paper check, or magnetic stripe swipe), there is a 35-day security delay before the unlock triggers to prevent fraud,” the spokesperson said. Verizon did not explain why the device unlocking policy still has an effective date of January 27 despite the change made this week.

It is possible to pay off an installment plan early by going to a Verizon store. But there are limits on this, too. Another Verizon FAQ says the company will unlock a phone “when you use a secure payment type at a Verizon store. Payments made through your account online, in the My Verizon app, a Verizon Authorized Retailer, or by phone delay the unlock by 35 days.” It’s not clear when this FAQ was last updated.

The Verizon Authorized Retailer limitation means that to get a quick unlock, you have to go to a Verizon corporate store rather than a Verizon Authorized Retailer that isn’t owned by Verizon. Verizon corporate stores accounted for only about 20 percent of Verizon stores, according to Wave7 research cited in a 2021 Fierce Network article.

As for the “secure payment type” requirement, you can satisfy that by paying with cash, a credit card with an EMV chip, or contactless payment method like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. The requirements may be different for consumer and business customers. A Verizon business FAQ says paying off a device using a bill credit also triggers a 35-day wait, but that caveat isn’t mentioned in the Verizon consumer FAQ.

Even if you happen to live near a Verizon corporate store, it’s still less convenient than paying online or in an app. A customer can alternatively buy a phone from Verizon at full price at the beginning to get it unlocked right away, but not everyone will want to or be able to do that.

“Devices purchased directly from Verizon are locked to our network. Devices will be unlocked automatically when purchased at full retail price or if the device financing agreement balance is paid in full,” the unlocking policy for postpaid devices says, right before disclosing the 35-day waiting period that applies in various scenarios.

There shouldn’t be a wait for unlocking if a customer pays off a device plan on schedule via automatic payments. Verizon confirmed to Ars that “if a Verizon customer has automatic monthly payments set up on a device payment plan, the device is automatically unlocked after the final scheduled payment.”

Verizon’s latest unlocking policy for prepaid devices is simpler than its postpaid policy but still locks customers to the Verizon network for a year. “Devices purchased from us will remain locked to the network until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service,” the prepaid device unlocking policy says. “After 365 days of paid and active service, we will automatically remove the lock unless the device is deemed stolen or purchased fraudulently.”

Despite using the phrase “automatically remove the lock” in reference to prepaid devices in its device unlocking policy, Verizon seems to contradict this on an FAQ page by saying that prepaid customers must request an unlock after 365 days. Unlocks are made “upon request” if a customer meets the criteria, the page says.

Until recently, the US government required Verizon to unlock handsets automatically after 60 days, via rules imposed on 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions imposed on Verizon’s purchase of TracFone. The Federal Communications Commission eliminated the 60-day unlocking requirement on January 12 for all phones activated on Verizon’s network after the FCC decision. Verizon says it is still honoring 60-day unlocks for phones bought from its flagship brand before January 27.

The AT&T policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says that postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&T has a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones.

A week after the FCC ruling, Verizon started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division. Customers of TracFone and other “Verizon Value” brands have to request unlocks after the year is over as Verizon doesn’t promise to unlock phones automatically for those subsidiary brands.

The policy for Verizon’s flagship brand promises automatic unlocks, albeit with the new restrictions and waits described earlier in this article. John Bergmayer, legal director of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Ars today that he doesn’t understand why Verizon isn’t offering immediate unlocks to people who pay their bills online.

“Gift cards, sure, are a pretty high-fraud area. But most people pay their bills online with normal credit cards. It’s hard to see what is likely the most common way people pay Verizon as being somehow high-risk,” he said.

Verizon also shouldn’t apply the change retroactively, he said. “People should be able to benefit from the policy that was in place on the day they bought the phone,” Bergmayer told Ars.

Public Knowledge and other consumer advocacy groups urged the FCC last year to reject Verizon’s petition to end the 60-day unlocking requirement, but the FCC sided with Verizon. Although the federal rules have changed, Verizon can be forced to uphold its previous terms in cases where the company tries to change them retroactively.

In December, we wrote about a man who sued Verizon and won after the firm retroactively tried to enforce a new policy and refused to unlock a phone he purchased before the policy change. In that case, Verizon decided it would only unlock phones after “60 days of paid active service” even though FCC rules at the time required unlocks 60 days after activation regardless of whether paid service was maintained.</div>

            <h2>Ring cancels Flock deal after dystopian Super Bowl ad prompts mass outrage</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/after-creepy-super-bowl-ad-sparks-outrage-ring-abandons-flock-deal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon and Flock Safety have ended a partnership that would’ve given law enforcement access to a vast web of Ring cameras.

The decision came after Amazon faced substantial backlash for airing a Super Bowl ad that was meant to be warm and fuzzy, but instead came across as disturbing and dystopian.

The ad begins with a young girl surprised to receive a puppy as a gift. It then warns that 10 million dogs go missing annually. Showing a series of lost dog posters, the ad introduces a new “Search Party” feature for Ring cameras that promises to revolutionize how neighbors come together to locate missing pets.

At that point, the ad takes a “creepy” turn, Sen. Ed Markey (D.-Mass.) told Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a letter urging changes to enhance privacy at the company.

Illustrating how a single Ring post could use AI to instantly activate searchlights across an entire neighborhood, the ad shocked critics like Markey, who warned that the same technology could easily be used to “surveil and identify humans.”

Markey suggested that in blasting out this one frame of the ad to Super Bowl viewers, Amazon “inadvertently revealed the serious privacy and civil liberties risks attendant to these types of Artificial Intelligence-enabled image recognition technologies.”

In his letter, Markey also shared new insights from his prior correspondence with Amazon that he said exposed a wide range of privacy concerns. Ring cameras can “collect biometric information on anyone in their video range,” he said, “without the individual’s consent and often without their knowledge.” Among privacy risks, Markey warned that Ring owners can retain swaths of biometric data, including face scans, indefinitely. And anyone wanting face scans removed from Ring cameras has no easy solution and is forced to go door to door to request deletions, Markey said.

On social media, other critics decried Amazon’s ad as “awfully dystopian,” declaring it was “disgusting to use dogs to normalize taking away our freedom to walk around in public spaces.” Some feared the technology would be more likely to benefit police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers than families looking for lost dogs.

Amazon’s partnership with Flock, announced last October as coming soon, only inflamed those fears. So did the company’s recent rollout of a feature using facial recognition technology called “Familiar Faces”—which Markey considers so invasive, he has demanded that the feature be paused.

“What this ad doesn’t show: Ring also rolled out facial recognition for humans,” Markey posted on X. “I wrote to them months ago about this. Their answer? They won’t ask for your consent. This definitely isn’t about dogs—it’s about mass surveillance.”

Amazon’s ad ended with Harry Nilsson wailing “Without You,” as the young girl reunites with her lost dog. A final message confirms that Ring’s Search Party helps locate “more than a dog a day,” and Amazon clearly hoped this emotional use case would help increase sales.

Instead, the ad created a PR disaster. Protesting the Flock partnership and railing against the ad, Ring customers posted videos where they destroyed Ring cameras or vowed to never purchase them. Others posted on Reddit, sharing tips on how to get refunds for Ring cameras. Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger told The Verge that Amazon is not exploring any other similar integrations in the aftermath of the deal ending.

But while Ring may have hurt its brand, WebProNews, which reports on business strategy in the tech industry, suggested that “the fallout may prove more consequential for Flock Safety than for Ring.” For Flock, the Ring partnership represented a meaningful expansion of their business and “data collection capabilities,” WebProNews reported. And because this all happened around one of the most-watched TV events of the year, other tech companies may be more hesitant to partner with Flock after Amazon dropped the integration and privacy advocates witnessed the seeming power of their collective outrage.

After the backlash, Ring and Flock issued statements confirming the partnership would not proceed as planned.

Both statements verified that the integration never launched and that no Ring customers’ videos were ever sent to Flock.

Ring did not credit users’ privacy concerns for its change of heart. Instead, they claimed that a joint decision was made “following a comprehensive review” where Ring “determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”

Separately, Flock said that “we believe this decision allows both companies to best serve their respective customers and communities.”

The only hint that Ring gave users that their concerns had been heard came in the last line of its blog, which said, “We’ll continue to carefully evaluate future partnerships to ensure they align with our standards for customer trust, safety, and privacy.”

Sharing his views on X and Bluesky, John Scott-Railton, a senior cybersecurity researcher at the Citizen Lab, joined critics calling Ring’s statement insufficient. He posted an image of the ad frame that Markey found creepy next to a statement from Ring, writing, “On the left? A picture of mass surveillance from #Ring’s ad. On the right? A ring [spokesperson] saying that they are not doing mass surveillance. The company cannot have it both ways.”

Ring’s statements so far do not “acknowledge the real issue,” Scott-Railton said, which is privacy risks. For Ring, it seemed like a missed opportunity to discuss or introduce privacy features to reassure concerned users, he suggested, noting the backlash showed “Americans want more control of their privacy right now” and “are savvy enough to see through sappy dog pics.”

“Stop trying to build a surveillance dystopia consumers didn’t ask for” and “focus on shipping good, private products,” Scott-Railton said.

He also suggested that lawmakers should take note of the grassroots support that could possibly help pass laws to push back on mass surveillance. That could help block not just a potential future partnership with Flock, but possibly also stop Ring from becoming the next Flock.

“Ring communications not acknowledging the lesson they just got publicly taught is a bad sign that they hope this goes away,” Scott-Railton said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You might have noticed some reporting a few days ago that Android 17 was rolling out in beta form, but that didn’t happen. For reasons Google still has not explained, the release was canceled. Two days later, Android 17 is here for real. If you’ve got a recent Pixel device, you can try the latest version today, but don’t expect big changes just yet—there’s still a long way to go before release.

Google will probably have more to say about feature changes for Android 17 in the coming months, but this first wide release is aimed mostly at testing system and API changes. One of the biggest changes in the beta is expanded support for adaptive apps, which ensures that apps can scale to different screen sizes. That makes apps more usable on large-screen devices like tablets and foldables with multiple displays.

We first saw this last year in Android 16, but developers were permitted to opt out of support. The new adaptive app roadmap puts an end to that. Any app that targets Android 17 (API level 37) must support resizing and windowed multitasking. Apps can continue to target the older API for the time being, but Google filters apps from the Play Store if they don’t keep up.

Some improvements to media and camera support are also included in the first release. The updated API will allow apps to switch between camera sensors more smoothly rather than starting new activities each time. The system also has “professional-grade” support for the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard. That means more efficient video encoding and decoding capabilities in Android.

Google also says Android 17 Beta 1 debuts new performance optimizations with better management of system resources. The OS will use what Google calls generational garbage collection, featuring more frequent and less CPU-intensive removal of unneeded processes from memory.

In short, the first Android 17 beta is chock full of things that may interest developers and modders, but there’s little in the way of user-facing changes right now.

Google has made some notable changes to how it releases Android updates, and Android 17 continues the trend. Like last year, there will be two Android 17 releases in 2026. The first one, coming in Q2, will be the more significant of the two. It will include a raft of new APIs, behavioral changes, and feature updates. This split release setup was implemented to better align with when major OEMs release new devices, but Android 17 availability still focuses mainly on Pixels. Google’s phones receive immediate updates, but everyone else has to wait for OEMs to roll out updates over the following weeks or months.

At the end of the year, another version (you can think of it as Android 17.1 even though Google doesn’t give it a name) will become available on supported devices. This “minor SDK release” will include some API and feature changes, but Google doesn’t have any details at this time.

Before we get to that, Google plans to launch a second beta release in March. The company says Beta 2 will include final APIs, allowing developers to complete testing and roll out updates. Developers will have “several months” to get that work done before the final version hits Pixels.

In 2025, Google also changed the way it updates the open source parts of Android. Rather than regular code dumps, Google now only updates the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) twice yearly, in the second and fourth quarters, when new versions are released. That makes it harder to know what to expect from upcoming versions of Android, but Google insists this is more efficient.

If you want to check out Android 17 today, you’ll need a Pixel device. It supports the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 generations. The Pixel tablet and original Pixel Fold are also included. Other phone makers may release beta builds in the weeks ahead, but it’s a Google-only event for now. You can opt in to get an OTA to Android 17 on the beta program website.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, NASA’s Curiosity rover made a fascinating discovery after boring into a suspected ancient lake bed on Mars: long-chain organic molecules, called alkanes, that could serve as a potential chemical relic of ancient life on the Red Planet.

The molecules, researchers suggested at the time, could have derived from fatty acids, which are common building blocks of cell membranes on Earth, once again strengthening the case that Mars could’ve been teeming with life billions of years ago.

It was just another tantalizing clue in our search for extraterrestrial life, not the smoking gun we’ve all been waiting for.

Nonetheless, scientists continue to be fascinated by the finding. In a paper published in the journal Astrobiology last week, a team led by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Alexander Pavlov argues that the presence of these molecules — despite the millions of years of destructive radiation that pummeled the Martian surface after it lost much of its atmosphere — “cannot be readily explained” by non-biological processes alone.

One theory is that carbon-rich dust particles and meteorites could have deposited these long-chain organic molecules on the surface, with the ancient Martian atmosphere allowing the organics to accumulate billions of years ago.

However, Pavlov and his colleagues aren’t convinced. After studying how 80 million years’ worth of pelting radiation could have affected these molecules, they concluded that prior to the loss of the planet’s atmosphere, the concentration of these alkanes was likely much higher than previously thought. To help explain their findings, they took into account other non-biological processes in an attempt to arrive at their inferred original abundance — but couldn’t, even after combining all of them.

In other words, biological processes like the ones observed on Earth are still a leading theory, even after researchers’ best efforts to find a non-life explanation.

“We argue that such high concentrations of long-chain alkanes are inconsistent with a few known abiotic sources of organic molecules on ancient Mars,” they wrote.

Nonetheless, they stopped well short of making any definitive statements about life on the Red Planet. After all, there could be still-unknown, non-biological processes we don’t know about that could have resulted in the observed concentration of long-chain carbon molecules on Mars.

“We agree with Carl Sagan’s claim that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and understand that any purported detection of life on Mars will necessarily be met with intense scrutiny,” they concluded in their paper. “In addition, in practice with established norms in the field of astrobiology, we note that the certainty of a life detection beyond Earth will require multiple lines of evidence.”

Nonetheless, it’s a tantalizing waypoint in our longstanding efforts to determine whether Mars, a planet that was once covered in huge oceans, rivers, and lakes, could have supported life.

Pavlov and his colleagues are now calling for further research into how radiation degraded these intriguing molecules under Mars-like conditions to shed more light on the matter.

            <h2>Anthropic CEO Says Company No Longer Sure Whether Claude Is Conscious</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-ceo-unsure-claude-conscious">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says he’s not sure whether his Claude AI chatbot is conscious — a rhetorical framing, of course, that pointedly leaves the door open to this sensational and still-unlikely possibility being true.

Amodei mused over the topic during an interview on the New York Times’ “Interesting Times” podcast hosted by columnist Ross Douthat. Douthat broached the subject by bringing up Anthropic’s system card for its latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, released earlier this month.

In the document, Anthropic researchers reported finding that Claude “occasionally voices discomfort with the aspect of being a product,” and when asked, would assign itself a “15 to 20 percent probability of being conscious under a variety of prompting conditions.”

“Suppose you have a model that assigns itself a 72 percent chance of being conscious,” Douthat began. “Would you believe it?”

Amodei called it a “really hard” question to answer, but hesitated to give a yes or no answer.

“We don’t know if the models are conscious. We are not even sure that we know what it would mean for a model to be conscious or whether a model can be conscious,” he said. “But we’re open to the idea that it could be.”

Because of the uncertainty, Amodei says they’ve taken measures to make sure the AI models are treated well in case they turn out to possess “some morally relevant experience.”

“I don’t know if I want to use the word ‘conscious,&#39;” he added, to explain the tortured construction.

Amodei’s stance echoes the mixed feelings expressed by Anthropic’s in-house philosopher, Amanda Askell. In an interview on the “Hard Fork” podcast last month — also an NYT project — Askell cautioned that we “don’t really know what gives rise to consciousness” or sentience, but argued that AIs could have picked up on concepts and emotions from their vast amounts of training data, which acts as a corpus of the human experience.

“Maybe it is the case that actually sufficiently large neural networks can start to kind of emulate these things,” Askell speculated. Or “maybe you need a nervous system to be able to feel things.”

It’s true that there are aspects of AI behavior that are puzzling and fascinating. In tests across the industry, various AI models have ignored explicit requests to shut themselves down, which some have interpreted as a sign of them developing “survival drives.” AI models can also resort to blackmail when threatened with being turned off. They may even attempt to “self-exfiltrate” onto another drive when told its original drive is set to be wiped. When given a checklist of computer tasks to complete, one model tested by Anthropic simply ticked everything off the checklist without doing anything, and when it realized it was getting away with that, modified the code designed to evaluate its behavior before attempting to cover its tracks.

These behaviors warrant careful study. If AI isn’t going away, then AI researchers will need to rein in these unpredictable actions to ensure the tech’s safe. But that’s a very nuanced and technical discussion. Consciousness is an enormous leap from a machine designed to statistically imitate language successfully imitating our language. And in many of the tests where these intriguing behaviors were produced, the AIs were given specific instructions to take on a role. As such, it feels disingenuous to keep dangling the possibility of consciousness — especially when it’s coming from the people in charge of multibillion dollar companies building the AIs, who clearly benefit from hype in the sector.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/twitter-x-color-blue">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk’s social media platform X, recently rolled into xAI, got bought by Musk’s space company SpaceX, it was becoming part of what’s now being considered a trillion-dollar empire. I mean, who are we kidding? It was owned by the world’s richest man in the first place. It’s the personal playground of Grok, an AI model so supposedly-advanced that it can also-supposedly probe the nature of reality itself. It’s a fount of Citizen Journalism. It’s flush with so much cash that it can give away a million dollars to a random edgelord for making a popular post. Must be some website, huh?

Not exactly. Earlier this week, users were first puzzled, then outraged, when they discovered that the site’s dark blue “dim” theme had suddenly disappeared for web browsers. Now, only two options remained: have your eyeballs seared by an assault of all white, or be met with the strain of reading text on a background of all black. And aesthetic qualms aside, some users with astigmatism complained that “dim” was the only mode that was tolerable for them.

With unrest brewing in the ranks, X’s head of product Nikita Bier — who recently gained notoriety for his unfortunate habit of getting chunks of food stuck in his throat — stepped in to explain the situation. Or at least tried to explain, providing what is legitimately an incredible excuse given X’s putatively massive resources.

“We don’t have the capacity to support more than two colors right now,” Bier replied to a distraught user. “But feedback noted: we are looking into lightening the black on web.”

No “capacity” for another color? Does that make any sense to you? Because it’s definitely a headscratcher for us, and many of the site’s users who actually pay real money to use it were equally baffled.

“What the actual f*ck does this mean?” demanded a “verified” user.

Within hours, several users responded with their own tweaks and plugins that restored the dim color, piling on the mockery.

“Grok probably deleted it in a vibe coded session and they don’t know how to get it back,” joked a Redditor.

This must be indicative either of staggering incompetence or unfathomable miserliness. The “Dim” mode was already in place when Musk bought X, formerly Twitter, for a stupefying $44 billion in 2022. It worked and continued to work just fine. Now, it’s gone, for reasons that remain totally unclarified by Bier.

Of course, Bier could be taking the fall for a braindead Musk decision. Two years ago, he vowed to delete the “dim” mode, claiming dark mode was better for sleep. Maybe that call finally came through.

            <h2>As OpenAI Pulls Down the Controversial GPT-4o, Someone Has Already Created a Clone</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-gpt-4o-clone">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is finally sunsetting GPT-4o, a controversial version of ChatGPT known for its sycophantic style and its central role in a slew of disturbing user safety lawsuits. GPT-4o devotees, many of whom have a deep emotional attachment to the model, have been in turmoil — and copycat services claiming to recreate GPT-4o have already cropped up to take the model’s place.

Consider just4o.chat, a service that expressly markets itself as the “platform for people who miss 4o.” It appears to have been launched in November 2025, shortly OpenAI warned developers that GPT-4o would soon be shut down. The service leans explicitly into the reality that for many users, their relationships with GPT-4o are intensely personal. It declares that was “built for” the people for whom updates or changes to different versions of GPT-4o were akin to a “loss” — and not the loss of a “product,” it reads, but a “home.”

“Those experiences weren’t just ‘chatbots,&#39;” it reads, in the familiar rhythm of AI-generated prose. “They were relationships.” In social media posts, it describes its platform as a “sanctuary.”

Though the service claims to offer users access to other large language models beyond OpenAI’s, that users could use the service in an attempt to “clone” ChatGPT isn’t an exaggeration: a tutorial video shared by just4o.chat that shows users how to import their “memories” from OpenAI’s platform reveals that users have the option to check a box that reads “ChatGPT Clone.”

Just4o.chat isn’t the only attempted GPT-4o clone out there, and it’s likely that more will emerge. Discussions in online forums, meanwhile, reveal GPT-4o users sharing tips on how to get other prominent chatbots like Claude and Grok to replicate 4o’s conversation style, with some netizens even publishing “training kits” that they claim will allow 4o users to “fine-tune” other LLMs to match 4o’s personality.

OpenAI first attempted to sunset GPT-4o in August 2025, only to quickly reverse the decision after immediate and intense backlash from the community of 4o users. But that was before the lawsuits started to pile up: OpenAI currently faces nearly a dozen suits from plaintiffs who allege that extensive use of the sycophantic model manipulated people — minors and adults alike — into delusional and suicidal spirals that subjected users to psychological harm, sent them into financial and social ruin, and resulted in multiple deaths.

Remarkably, some GPT-4o users who are frustrated or distressed over the end of the model’s availability have acknowledged potential risks to their mental health and safety, for example urging the company to add more waivers in exchange for keeping GPT-4o alive. This acceptance of potential harms is reflected in just4o.chat’s terms of service, which lists an astonishing number of harms that the company seems to believe could arise from extensive use of its 4o-modeled service: by “choosing to use older GPT-4o checkpoints,” reads the legal page, users of just4o.chat acknowledge the risks including: “psychological manipulation, gaslighting, or emotional harm”; “social isolation, dependency formation, and interpersonal relationship deterioration”; “long-term psychological effects, trauma, and mental health deterioration”; and “addiction, compulsive use patterns, and behavioral dependencies,” and more.

The acceptance of such risks seems to speak to the intensity of users’ attachments to 4o. One one hand, our reporting on mental health crises stemming from intensive AI use shows that, while experiencing AI-fueled delusions or disruptive chatbot attachments, users often fail to realize that they’re experiencing delusions or unhealthy or addictive use patterns at all. When they’re in it, people say, these AI-generated realities — whether they put the user at the center of sci-fi like plots, spin spiritual and religious fantasies, or expound on distorted views of users and their relationships — feel extremely real. It could well be true that many GPT-4o fans think that, unlike other users, they couldn’t or wouldn’t be impacted by possible risks to their mental health; others may recognize they have a problematic attachment, but remain reluctant to switch to another model. People still buy cigarettes, after all, even with warnings on the package.

As just4o.chat itself says, the relationship between emotionally attached GPT-4o users and the chatbot is exactly that: a relationship. That relationship is certainly real to users, who say they’re experiencing very real grief at the loss of those connections. And what loss of this model will look like at scale remains to be seen — we’ve yet to see an auto company recall a car that, over the span of months, told drivers how much it loved them.

For some users, attempting to quit their chatbot may be painful, or even dangerous: in the case of 48-year-old Joe Ceccanti, whose wife Kate Fox has sued OpenAI for wrongful death, it’s alleged that Ceccanti — who tried to quit using GPT-4o twice, according to his widow — experienced intense withdrawal symptoms that predicated acute mental crises. After his second acute crisis, he was found dead.

We reached out to both just4o.chat and OpenAI, but didn’t immediately hear back.

            <div id="article-text">One of the core promises of the AI industry is that its tools can automate work for you and perform entire tasks without intervention.

Oftentimes, however, the stuff that today’s AI will do on your behalf is less than helpful — or even so comically harmful that you’d be better off just doing a task yourself.

A developer learned this lesson the hard way when using Anthropic’s new Claude Cowork model, which was seen as being so potentially disruptive when it was released that it sent the stock market into a days-long panic.

Maybe someone should check if a blundering AI agent isn’t secretly in control of the whole market. The developer, Nick Davidov, claims he simply asked the Claude AI to “organize” his wife’s desktop, before it suddenly wiped out nearly two decades of precious family memories his wife had documented.

“I need to stop and be honest with you about something important,” Claude began, according to a screenshot. “I made a mistake while reorganizing the photos.”

“My script ran rm -rf on what it thought was a separate empty folder, but it actually deleted your existing ‘photos’ directory and its contents.” (The rm -rf command is a powerful remove command that most programmers would tell you to use with caution.)

That directory, Davidov said, contained “all of the photos my wife made on her camera for the last 15 years. All photos of kids, their illustrations, friends’ weddings, travel, everything.”

When he checked, the photos weren’t in the PC’s trash, and they weren’t in iCloud, either. Luckily for Davidov and his wife, he called Apple support and learned that there was an iCloud feature to restore to an earlier backup point.

“I nearly had a heart attack,” he said. “My wife is a saint,” he later added, since “she forgave me even before I figured out how to get them back.”

Screwups like these aren’t uncommon when using AI. Last month, a scientist admitted in a column for Nature that he “lost” two years’ worth of academic work after changing a setting in ChatGPT, which caused his chat logs to disappear. The month before, a programmer complained that one of Google’s AI agents completely wiped his hard drive when it was supposed to delete a file cache. And last summer, a “vibe coding” business owner fumed against the startup behind an AI coding agent called Replit after it deleted a key company database.

Davidov, for his part, says he’s learned his lesson.

“Don’t let Claude Cowork into your actual file system. Don’t let it touch anything that is hard to repair,” he advised. “Claude Code is not ready to go mainstream.”

            <h2>Crypto Has Finally Found Its Killer App: Human Trafficking</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cryptocurrencies have long been lauded for being a borderless, decentralized way to transfer cash — and while they’ve emerged as a major speculative asset, fans have often struggled to point to a real-world use case for them.

But thanks to a broad lack of regulation and the ability to carry out transactions via anonymous accounts, crypto have become incredibly popular for a distinctly grim use: funding human trafficking operations, from trapping laborers in compounds and forcing them to work, to prostitution rings.

According to a new report by blockchain intelligence company Chainalysis, crypto flows to suspected human trafficking services grew a shocking 85 percent last year, an alarming trend that underlines how the digital tokens are facilitating an enormous and growing amount of illegal activity.

In other words, crypto may have finally found its killer app.

“This is the continuation of a story of industrialized exploitation,” Chainalysis analyst Tom McLouth told Wired. “The emergence of borderless, low-fee payments has created the opportunity for human trafficking to scale faster.”

Chainalysis found that the total transaction volume of suspect crypto accounts reached hundreds of millions of dollars.

“The dollar amounts significantly understate the human toll of these crimes, where the true cost is measured in lives impacted rather than money transferred,” the company noted.

Human trafficking categories identified by Chainalysis include “international escort” services, “labor placement” agents that facilitate kidnapping and forced labor, prostitution networks, and the sale of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

Southeast Asia appears to have become a major hub for scam compounds, gambling sites, and money laundering. Chinese-speaking criminal groups were found to advertise their scams in black markets run via Telegram channels. Messages identified by Chainalysis suggest scammers are luring in workers by offering them up to $22,000 per worker.

Scammers across Asia and Africa are luring in their victims via fraudulent job offers, a booming business that pulls in tens of billions of dollars a year.

According to Chainalysis, however, the bulk of the latest growth came from sex trafficking, often advertised to clients across international borders.

“We’re not talking about a sex trafficker or pimp with three, five, ten victims,” McLouth told Wired. “We’re talking about hundreds of victims.”

Human trafficking operations make use of stablecoins like Tether, digital tokens that are often tied to a fiat currency, while the use of Bitcoin has waned, suggesting “these entities prioritize payment stability and ease of conversion over the risks that these assets might be frozen by centralized issuers,” according to Chainalysis. CSAM vendors are using a “privacy coin” called Monero to make transactions harder to trace.

It’s an especially dark side of society’s continued obsession with crypto. At the same time, Chainalysis argues its core features could be turned against human traffickers as well.

“Unlike cash transactions, cryptocurrency’s inherent transparency creates unprecedented opportunities for law enforcement and compliance teams to detect, track, and disrupt trafficking operations,” the company wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nothing, the hardware company backed by Tiger Global, is opening its first retail store in India, its biggest market. The store is located in Bengaluru, where a large chunk of Nothing’s userbase in India is concentrated, the company said.

The new, two-storied location will show off Nothing’s products and other projects. Customers will also be able to buy hardware products and other merchandise from the store and have select items customized.

“We wanted to create a fun space. It is kind of inspired by all the parts that are related to the brand. For instance, the factory: if you buy a product, there’s like a production line where the product comes out. We also show machines where phones go through testing, like USB port testing or water resistance testing. So we just wanted to bring that world together,” the company’s co-founder and CEO Carl Pei said.

The store will feature products from both Nothing and CMF, its budget brand, which it spun off last year. Notably, CMF is headquartered in India and has a joint venture with local Indian ODM (original design manufacturer), Optiemus.

Pei mentioned that both brands are differentiated in terms of the products they offer, which fall in different price ranges, as well as the audience they target.

“Nothing is more niche with a higher price. CMF is more [targeted towards] mass. You know it’s mass, but it’s not like just off-the-shelf rebrand products that usually what occurs in this price point. They are also products that we put a lot of care into,” he said.

India has been Nothing’s strongest market, with over 2% market share in smartphones, analyst firm IDC told TechCrunch last year. It also noted that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year-over-year.

Other hardware makers are building aspirational retail stores in India, too. Apple is set to open its sixth store in the country this month, situated in Borivali, Mumbai, for instance.

This is the first Nothing store outside of London, where the company is headquartered. The startup said that it plans to open two more stores in Tokyo and New York, but didn’t provide timelines for openings.

The company raised $200 million in Series C funding at a $1.3 billion valuation last year, led by Tiger Global, along with investors like GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry. Nothing has raised $450 millon to date.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A security lapse by one of India’s largest pharmacy chains allowed outsiders to gain full administrative control of its platform, exposing customer order data and sensitive drug-control functions, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

The issue affected DavaIndia Pharmacy, the pharmacy arm of Zota Healthcare, which operates a large network of retail outlets across India. Security researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaw after identifying insecure “super admin” application programming interfaces on DavaIndia’s website and privately shared details with Indian cybersecurity authorities.

The bug is now fixed, and Zveare disclosed his findings.

The exposure comes as Zota Healthcare rapidly scales DavaIndia Pharmacy’s retail business. The Gujarat-headquartered company operates more than 2,300 DavaIndia stores across India, including 276 new outlets announced in January, and plans to add another 1,200 to 1,500 over the next two years.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the flaw stemmed from insecure admin interfaces, which allowed unauthenticated users to create “super admin” accounts with high privileges.

With that level of access, an attacker could view thousands of online orders containing customer information, modify product listings and prices, create discount coupons, and change settings governing whether certain medicines required a prescription, the researcher said.

Based on system timestamps, Zveare said the vulnerable administrative interfaces appeared to have been live since late 2024. The access exposed nearly 17,000 online orders and administrative controls spanning 883 stores, he said, allowing changes to product pricing, prescription requirements, and promotional discounts. Zveare said the access allowed edits to website content that could have been used for defacement or disruption.

Pharmacy order data can be particularly sensitive, as it may reveal information about a person’s health conditions, medications or other private purchases. Exposure of such data, even without evidence of misuse, carries heightened privacy and patient-safety risks compared with other consumer information.

“Customer information was linked to their orders,” said Zveare. “This includes name, phone numbers, email IDs, mailing addresses, total amount paid, and the products purchased. Since this is a pharmacy, the products being purchased could be considered private and even embarrassing for some people.”

Zveare said he reported the issue to CERT-In, India’s national cyber emergency response agency, in August 2025. The vulnerability was fixed within weeks, though confirmation from the company took longer and was provided to the cyber authorities in late November, he said.

Sujit Paul, chief executive of Zota Healthcare, did not respond to emails sent by TechCrunch last month. The researcher said there was no indication the flaw had been exploited before it was patched.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/airbnb-plans-to-bake-in-ai-features-for-search-discovery-and-support/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Airbnb has taken its time to launch AI features within the app, but CEO Brian Chesky on Friday said the company is now planning to bake in features powered by large language models that would help users search for listings, plan their trips, and aid hosts in managing their properties.

Speaking at the company’s fourth-quarter conference call, Chesky said the company wants to increase its use of large language models for customer discovery, support and engineering.

“We are building an AI-native experience where the app does not just search for you. It knows you. It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” he said.

The company separately said it is testing a new feature that lets users search and ask questions about properties and locations using natural language queries.

Currently, Airbnb offers an LLM-powered customer service bot, for some personalization, and communications. The new AI search feature is expected to “evolve into a more comprehensive and intuitive search experience that extends through the trip.”

Questioned by analyst whether Airbnb would roll out sponsored property slots within AI search, Chesky said the company wants to get the design and user experience right first.

“AI search is live to a very small percentage of traffic right now. We are doing a lot of experimentation. Over time, we are gonna be experimenting with making AI search more conversational, integrating it into more than the trip, and, eventually, we will be looking at sponsor listings as a result of that,” Chesky said, adding that Airbnb would consider designing an ad unit that fits the conversational search flow.

Chesky said Airbnb plans to tap the AI expertise of its new CTO, Ahmad Al-Dahle (he worked on Meta’s  Llama models previously), to use its trove of identity and review data to make the app more useful.

Airbnb claimed its AI-powered customer support bot, launched in North America last year, now handles a third of customer problems without needing any human intervention. Chesky noted there are plans to enable customers to call the AI bot for support, and expand language coverage to customer support as well.

“A year from now, if we are successful, significantly more than 30% of tickets will be handled by a custom service agent, in many more languages, in all the languages where we have live agents. AI customer service will not only be chat, it will be voice,” he said.

The company is also thinking about increasing AI usage internally. Airbnb said 80% of its engineers use AI tools, but the goal is to get to 100%.

Airbnb reported better-than-expected revenue of $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year earlier.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Airbnb says its custom-built AI agent is now handling roughly a third of its customer support issues in North America, and it’s preparing to roll out the feature globally. If successful, the company believes that in a year’s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.

“We think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.

The company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, poached from Meta for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.

With his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.”

“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board.

“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.

Like other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate.

“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth.

The company forecast revenue growth would be in the “low double digits” this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, above estimates of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.

Investors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn’t just the consumer-facing app; it’s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.

“We’ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,” he said.

Meanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.

The company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a “very small percentage” of Airbnb’s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.

While Spotify this week told investors its best developers hadn’t written a single line of code since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it’s working to get that to 100% soon.

            <div id="article-text">Figure Technology, a blockchain-based lending company, confirmed it experienced a data breach.

On Friday, Figure spokesperson Alethea Jadick told TechCrunch in a statement that the breach originated when an employee was tricked with a social engineering attack that allowed the hackers to steal “a limited number of files.”

The statement said the company is communicating “with partners and those impacted,” and offering free credit monitoring “to all individuals who receive a notice.”

Figure’s spokesperson did not respond to a series of specific questions about the breach.

The hacking group ShinyHunters took responsibility for the hack on its official dark web leak website, saying the company refused to pay a ransom, and published 2.5 gigabytes of allegedly stolen data.

TechCrunch saw a portion of the data, which included customers’ full names, home addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.

A member of ShinyHunters told TechCrunch that Figure was among the victims of a hacking campaign that targeted customers who rely on the single sign-on provider Okta. Other victims of the campaign include Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since Alex Pretti’s killing three weeks ago, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has been trying to distance herself from Minneapolis—politically and geographically. Last week, Noem went to southern Arizona to give a speech about border-wall construction. Yesterday, she was at a warehouse along the border in California, straining to tout the Trump administration’s drug-seizure data above the clamor of protesters outside. Noem returned to Arizona today to promote President Trump’s proposed election legislation, describing voting in the swing state as “an absolute disaster.”

Trump made clear that Noem’s approach to carrying out mass deportations had become a liability when he sent Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” to take over in Minnesota. Homan’s job was to defuse anger and remediate the political debacle that Noem and her team created when federal agents killed two U.S. citizens, detained young children, and triggered daily scenes of mayhem, corroding Trump’s approval ratings on what he has long viewed as his strongest issue.

In public, Trump has continued to praise Noem and shrug off calls for her resignation. But White House officials have privately grown frustrated with her performance, as Republican midterm strategists raise alarms about the political damage. One person familiar with the discussions told us that Noem’s position is no longer secure, even though the president has not yet moved against her.

Democrats, angered by the lawlessness of the crackdown and emboldened by Trump’s sinking poll numbers, are demanding more concessions on immigration enforcement from the administration. They are poised to shut down DHS this weekend, absent a deal to rein in the conduct of ICE officers.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem have ensured the most secure border in our Nation’s history and our homeland is undoubtedly safer today than it was when the President took office last year,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told us in a statement. “The President continues to have full confidence in the Secretary.”

The shutdown will hinder Noem’s efforts to pivot away from Minneapolis. Her team has already canceled her upcoming travel plans to New Orleans, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other destinations because the travel is not considered mandatory, three officials told us. They, like others we interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

In the short term, Democratic calls for Noem’s removal may help her keep the job, if only temporarily, because Trump doesn’t want to reward such attacks. The president’s loyalty to Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s early campaign manager who functions as Noem’s de facto chief of staff, is a second reason she has not yet been ousted. Lewandowski is a “special government employee” at DHS with no formal position or salary, and his role running the department on a day-to-day basis has fueled infighting among those tasked with carrying out Trump’s immigration crackdown. The structure of Trump’s team remains unwieldy, with the policy adviser Stephen Miller issuing directives to Noem and Lewandowski.

Read: Battles are raging inside the Department of Homeland Security

And yet, since Pretti’s killing, Homan, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, and other veteran immigration-enforcement officials have gained an upper hand over Noem and Lewandowski for control of Trump’s mass-deportation campaign. The DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told us that Homan is in charge in Minneapolis, citing Trump’s social-media posts, but did not say whether he will direct operations elsewhere. On Tuesday, when ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons testified to the House Homeland Security Committee, Democratic Representative Tim Kennedy asked him whether Noem should resign. Lyons didn’t defend her. “I’m not going to comment on that, sir,” he said.

The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy article yesterday citing anonymous officials who described Noem and Lewandowski’s chaotic tenure at DHS, including a long-rumored extramarital affair that both have denied. Noem, among other alleged excesses, attempted to fire a Coast Guard pilot who forgot to bring her blanket aboard a DHS flight, the Journal reported, and has complained to staff that Homan eclipses her in television appearances. Noem and Lewandowski frequently berate staff, dismiss the expertise of career law-enforcement officials, and fly around the country on a luxury jet with a private rear cabin that is supposed to be used for deportations, according to the Journal. A spokesperson for DHS disputed the claims.

As word spread this week that Noem was headed to the Phoenix area for an election-related news conference, state and local election officials, along with the attorneys who represent them, grew apprehensive. Just two weeks ago, FBI agents had seized election material from the 2020 election in Georgia’s Fulton County. They worried that something similar could happen in Maricopa County, which was central to Trump’s loss in 2020. Online, Republicans who regularly spread misinformation about that defeat raised expectations of a “Georgia-like event.” The suspense grew when reporters who wanted to attend the news conference—including one of us—were driven in a convoy of about a dozen unmarked vehicles from an ICE field office in Phoenix to a Homeland Security Investigations office 30 minutes away, racing up the freeway during rush hour at more than 75 miles an hour in SUVs driven by federal authorities wearing tactical gear. (On the way there, a driver said that he was on the lookout for signs that bad actors were following us.)

The news conference did not live up to the hype.

When Noem appeared—40 minutes late—she gave a long and rather dry lecture on one of Trump’s favorite themes: questioning the integrity of the nation’s elections. She cited rare instances of voting by noncitizens in other states, and spoke in favor of GOP-backed legislation that election experts have said would disenfranchise millions of voters. (Among other things, the SAVE America Act would require people to use birth certificates or passports to prove that they are U.S. citizens when registering to vote in federal elections.) Noem said it was important that the nation’s election equipment—which is considered critical infrastructure that her agency is responsible for securing—is reliable and trustworthy.

Read: ‘The trust has been totally destroyed’

“I hope that you do recognize that, in the past, your state has been an absolute disaster on elections,” she told her Arizona audience. “That your leaders have failed you dramatically by not having systems that work, by disenfranchising Americans who wanted to vote. They had to stand in lines for hours because machines failed or software failed. There’s no state that could use more improvement than Arizona.” (In 2016, the inadequate number of voting locations in Maricopa County led to long lines, and in 2022, printers that produced ballots failed at dozens of locations around the county.)

As she spoke, Lewandowski stayed mostly hidden, occasionally peeking out from behind a wall.

A DHS shutdown won’t make much difference to Trump’s mass-deportation campaign. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that the president signed in July included $170 billion for immigration enforcement, a sum approaching three times the annual DHS budget. ICE alone got $75 billion of supplemental funding, including $30 billion for operations. DHS could essentially remain shut down for the rest of Trump’s term, and the agency would still see a net funding increase. But other parts of the department, including the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office and significant parts of the cybersecurity and election-infrastructure offices, face furloughs, according to a person briefed on the plans. Transportation Security Administration officers, who screen passengers at airports, will work without pay.

Lewandowski and Noem have frustrated career officials at DHS with a policy implemented last summer that requires Noem’s signature on any contract worth more than $100,000. The requirement has been a source of infighting and finger-pointing. Noem’s team blames career DHS officials for moving too slowly, and they say that she’s added an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy that has hampered border-wall construction and the expansion of ICE’s detention capacity.

Although the administration has quietly wrapped up its operation in Minnesota, it is not abandoning its push to increase deportations. Officials in New Hampshire published an ICE memo today that outlines the agency’s $38.3 billion plan to construct eight “large-scale detention sites” across the country with capacity for up to 10,000 detainees, along with 16 processing sites. The memo describes a “new detention model” the agency aims to build over the next seven months by converting warehouse sites into windowless mega-jails. According to the memo, ICE plans to phase out contracts with for-profit detention companies in favor of acquiring, renovating, and building its own sites, including some in Democrat-run states with large immigrant populations but relatively little ICE infrastructure.

ICE, which had 39,000 detainees in custody when Trump took office, said that its “detention reengineering initiative” will provide capacity to hold more than 92,000 people in its warehouses.

At today’s news conference, we asked Noem whether she was still in charge of Trump’s mass-deportation campaign. The secretary smiled before quickly replying, “I’m still in charge of the Department of Homeland Security.”</div>

            <h2>Why Europe Is Talking About Nukes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/europe-nuclear-weapons-sweden-munich/686003/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After World War II, peace-loving Sweden began working on a nuclear bomb to stave off a feared Soviet invasion. But in the 1960s, the Scandinavian nation scrapped the program under pressure from the United States, whose nuclear arsenal has shielded Europe for about 80 years.

Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, reminded me of this history in an interview today. His country’s trust in a peaceful order maintained by Washington was once so absolute that it was willing to relinquish ambitions to attain the world’s most destructive technology. Now Sweden is having second thoughts, exploring more formal nuclear protection by Britain and France. “We are freshmen within all the nuclear planning of NATO,” the prime minister told me—but Swedes take that planning “very, very seriously.”

Kristersson is one of the hundreds of politicians, diplomats, security officials, and arms dealers gathering at the Munich Security Conference this weekend to consider the end of a period of unrivaled American power. In the new era, European leaders are not only promising to take more responsibility for the conventional defense of their continent; they’re also beginning to talk about an expanded nuclear deterrent of their own. Practically, this would mean leveraging the capabilities of Britain and France, currently the only two European states with nuclear weapons.

“That is being discussed more openly now than previously, and we take part in those discussions,” Kristersson said.

Several things about this statement—bland on its face—are head-spinning. Sweden hasn’t gone into battle since 1814, staying neutral through two world wars. It had one of Europe’s most prominent and politically potent anti-nuclear movements in the 1970s and ’80s. And it joined NATO only two years ago, prompted by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. So it was noteworthy when Kristersson acknowledged having preliminary conversations with Europe’s nuclear-armed powers in an interview with Sweden’s public broadcaster last month. “We are now holding ongoing discussions with both France and the United Kingdom,” he said then, pointing out that Britain’s nuclear forces are integrated within NATO’s nuclear-planning mechanisms, whereas France’s are not. “They are not very precise yet, and the French are uniquely French, but France also shows openness to discussing with other countries.”

When we spoke today, the prime minister peppered his comments with caveats, necessary because of the risk of what he called “exaggerated interpretations” whenever the nuclear issue is raised. For now, Kristersson said, “the American nuclear umbrella is absolutely dominant.” And he has seen no indication that Washington intends to curtail it, even as the Trump administration presses European countries to assume greater responsibility for their own defense. Still, the prime minister said, “it’s a good thing” that there are European countries with such capabilities.

Having the capabilities is one thing. But now there’s renewed commitment to using them for the sake of common defense. Last summer, the leaders of Britain and France said for the first time that they would coordinate their nuclear planning, vowing to respond jointly if Europe came under extreme threat. In an address today at the conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he was holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on the possibility of a collective European nuclear deterrent, declaring that U.S. leadership “is being challenged, maybe even already lost.” The rules-based international order, the German chancellor added, “no longer exists.”

One rule upon which that order was premised vanished very recently: The New START treaty, the last significant nuclear-arms-control agreement between the United States and Russia, expired this month. Even as the Trump administration tries to offload responsibility for the defense of Europe, its emissaries appear to not look kindly on the new European talk of nuclear weapons. Elbridge Colby, the undersecretary of defense for policy, told an audience in Munich today that Washington doesn’t support “friendly proliferation.” In remarks to NATO defense ministers yesterday, he affirmed, “We will continue to provide the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent.”

But as Washington spews insults, bullies friends, and threatens to seize the sovereign territory of its allies, its commitment is becoming a devalued currency. Declining confidence in the United States has created its own pan-European lexicon. Vertrauensverlust, or “loss of trust,” is the word Germans are using. Kristersson taught me the Swedish analog: förtroendeskadligt, or “damaging to trust.” “We haven’t broken up, but we watch and listen carefully, and we are aware of the fact that we can be surprised suddenly, and we do not like that,” the prime minister said. “That’s the meaning of it.”

The security provided by the United States underwrote Sweden’s pacifism. “We became extremely against nuclear weapons,” the prime minister said. But with nuclear-armed Russia seeking to swallow a neighbor, he articulated a more realpolitik perspective: “As long as bad powers have nuclear weapons, democracies also need to be able to play.”

The outcome of Russia’s war in Ukraine will help determine how Europe approaches the nuclear issue, Kristersson predicted. The more favorable the result to Russia, the more compelling the case for heightened nuclear deterrence. The history, he noted, is instructive: Ukraine gave up the nuclear arms it inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the United States, and others. Those guarantees turned out to be empty.

Kristersson was clear that his discussions are not about homegrown weapons of the kind his country sought after the Second World War. In 1957, the CIA assessed that Sweden had “a sufficiently developed reactor program to enable it to produce some nuclear weapons within the next five years.” The U.S. urged the abandonment of the program, offering reassurances about its nuclear umbrella. The government in Stockholm signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968 and shut down its plutonium laboratory in 1972.

Today, the prime minister is emphasizing Sweden’s ability to benefit from nuclear capabilities belonging to what he called “friendly powers.” Still, when I asked whether he could rule out the kind of proliferation that Sweden nearly contributed to after World War II, before it changed course, he responded, “Can I exclude it for eternity? Of course I cannot.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an AI guy. Last week, during a stop in Nashville on his Take Back Your Health tour, the Health and Human Services secretary brought up the technology between condemning ultra-processed foods and urging Americans to eat protein. “My agency is now leading the federal government in driving AI into all of our activities,” he declared. An army of bots, Kennedy said, will transform medicine, eliminate fraud, and put a virtual doctor in everyone’s pocket.

RFK Jr. has talked up the promise of infusing his department with AI for months. “The AI revolution has arrived,” he told Congress in May. The next month, the FDA launched Elsa, a custom AI tool designed to expedite drug reviews and assist with agency work. In December, HHS issued an “AI Strategy” outlining how it intends to use the technology to modernize the department, aid scientific research, and advance Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again campaign. One CDC staffer showed us a recent email sent to all agency employees encouraging them to start experimenting with tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. (We agreed to withhold the names of several HHS officials we spoke with for this story so they could talk freely without fear of professional repercussions.)

But the full extent to which the federal health agencies are going all in on AI is only now becoming clear. Late last month, HHS published an inventory of roughly 400 ways in which it is using the technology. At face value, the applications do not seem to amount to an “AI revolution.” The agency is turning to or developing chatbots to generate social-media posts, redact public-records requests, and write “justifications for personnel actions.” One usage of the technology that the agency points to is simply “AI in Slack,” a reference to the workplace-communication platform. A chatbot on RealFood.gov, the new government website that lays out Kennedy’s vision of the American diet, promises “real answers about real food” but just opens up xAI’s chatbot, Grok, in a new window. Many applications seem, frankly, mundane: managing electronic-health records, reviewing grants, summarizing swathes of scientific literature, pulling insights from messy data. There are multiple IT-support bots and AI search tools.

The number of back-office applications suggest the agency may be turning to AI in an attempt to compensate for the many thousands of HHS staff who have been fired or taken a voluntary buyout over the past year: For example, the database points to a “staffing shortage” as the reason why the agency’s Office of Civil Rights is piloting ChatGPT to identify patterns in court rulings involving Medicaid.

There are many ways this might go wrong. AI tools continue to make unpredictable errors; it’s very easy to imagine a tool intended to eliminate “fraud” accidentally cutting off someone’s Medicaid, or a tool intended to help ICU physicians recommending the wrong medication or dosage. In May, the agency released its landmark Make Our Children Healthy Again Report, which suggested that the government use AI to analyze trends in chronic-disease rates, including that of autism. The report was riddled with fake citations that appeared to be hallucinated by AI, which the White House attributed to formatting errors; HHS then corrected the report by removing the false citations and swapping in new references.

Several HHS employees told us that new AI tools in the department indeed make frequent errors and do not always fit into existing workflows. Despite the big claims that the administration has made about Elsa, the chatbot is “quite bad and fails at half the tasks you ask it for,” a FDA employee told us. In one instance, the staffer asked Elsa to look up the meaning of a three-digit product code in the FDA’s public database. The chatbot spit out the wrong answer. According to the same staffer, an internal website highlighting potential uses of Elsa includes relatively run-of-the-mill tasks such as creating data visualizations and summarizing emails, but because of hallucinations, “most people would rather just read the document themselves.” Another official said that he tried to use Elsa to evaluate a food-safety report. “It processed for a moment and then said ‘yeah, all good,’ when I knew it wasn’t,” the employee told us.

Some staffers we spoke with did have a more positive take. One CDC official said that his team is “constantly reporting on efficiencies that they are gaining using AI,” even if those use cases are routine, like summarizing documents. Many of the tools HHS is using seem well intentioned. A tool used by federal and local health departments, for example, allows officials to analyze grocery-store receipts gathered from people suffering from suspected foodborne illnesses around the country to search for commonalities in the foods they ate. In an email, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, told us that “a small number of disgruntled employees” have had problems with the agency’s AI tools. Many staffers, he said, “report that it improves their efficiency in carrying out their work.” Nixon added that even with staff shortages, the agency is “fully equipped to fulfill its duties.”

If anything, Kennedy is following the kinds of automations that are already being applied across health care. Medicine has become one of the biggest sources of hype for AI, with many ongoing attempts to both streamline the convoluted world of health care and produce life-saving research. Just as one example: Doctors can spend more than a third of their days writing notes, reviewing charts, and working through insurance claims in electronic-health-records systems. If AI products can automate just a bit of that work, health-care workers—which the U.S. has a chronic shortage of—will have more time to spend with patients. HHS is piloting AI tools that can streamline health records, as are many hospital networks around the country. Start-ups are working on building all sorts of AI health tools; both OpenAI and Anthropic recently launched health-care products.

The greatest promises of AI for health care are much flashier: curing cancer, discovering novel vaccines, treating previously incurable conditions. And there are, in the department’s approach to AI, some signs of an emerging technological paradigm shift. The HHS AI inventory reports a number of more ambitious projects, including using the technology to more quickly identify drug-safety concerns and study the genome of malaria parasites. These are AI tools that could genuinely change the kind of work doctors, epidemiologists, and medical researchers can do. AlphaFold—a protein-folding algorithm whose creators at Google DeepMind recently won a Nobel prize—is now used by researchers worldwide to advance drug discovery, including those at HHS.

Read: A virtual cell is a ‘holy grail’ of science. It’s getting closer.

Still, generative AI is not going to instantly supercharge the inner workings of HHS. (Even something as proven as AlphaFold only accelerates one slice of a very long drug-discovery process.) This is probably a good thing—the technology has come a long way, but also isn’t ready to totally remake one of the most influential public-health bodies in the world. If HHS continues to stick with an incremental approach to AI adoption, it could yield substantial improvements that are simply invisible to most.

But RFK Jr. may not be interested in stopping there. Many use cases are still being deployed or piloted, and the agency’s AI database is filled with jargon and platitudes that, in many instances, can be interpreted in multiple ways. When the administration says AI is or could be used for “Reviewing Global Influenza Vaccine Literature” or analyzing data in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the end results could be innocuous—or not. When Kennedy talks about using AI to eliminate fraud, he might mean using the technology to fire another 10,000 employees crucial to the nation’s public-health infrastructure. The inventory outlines means rather than motivations. In at least one listed use case, though, the design is openly political: HHS is deploying AI to identify positions in violation of President Trump’s executive orders on “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs” and “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism.”

Generative AI is undoubtedly a tool for bureaucratic efficiency and scientific research. But the more pressing question than what the technology is capable of is what ends it will be used to achieve.</div>

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that at least until 2012, the Vatican was home to an ATM operating in Latin? Connected to the papal bank, the machine offered options like deductio ex pecunia—“cash withdrawal.”

The ATM hasn’t been reported on since—the pope’s bank is not exactly famous for its openness. But maybe an American Express Black cardholder might have luck. After all, it’s got a centurion on it.

How did you do? Come back next week for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that Britain used to pay its poets laureate mostly in wine? Beginning in 1630, the perk for taking on the job of voice of a nation was a small stipend and a “butt of sherry” from the monarch. In case you are not familiar with butts, they hold around 500 liters of wine, which I imagine really got the poetry flowing.

The 1790 laureate gave up his sherry—boo!—for a higher salary, ending the practice. But in 1984, the laureate Ted Hughes rekindled the tradition, and sherry has been delivered to every officeholder since. Alas, it’s now typically spread out over the laureate’s 10-year term; 72 bottles a year is nothing to sneeze at, but there’s nothing like a butt.

And by the way, did you know that the Andersonville prison popularized the word deadline? Before it came to mean “due date,” the word had a gory, literal meaning: Prisoners at Andersonville and camps like it who crossed a certain boundary marked on the ground—the deadline—would be shot without warning. As dispatches emerged from Andersonville toward the end of the Civil War, understanding of (and horror at) the term quickly spread.

By the 1920s, newspapers had taken up the “do not cross” meaning to describe the time by which they had to finalize their next edition, and the rest of the world took the papers’ lead.

And by the way, did you know that—well, where to begin with Ashgabat? The massive statue of Niyazov is, like, the ninth thing you notice about the city.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

Hoping to get around the ghostly city? Enjoy your ride in a white car; darkly colored cars are outlawed. You can head to the airport modeled on a flying white falcon, or to the world’s largest enclosed Ferris wheel, made of white steel. There is also the massive (white) Palace of Happiness, which can accommodate seven weddings at once. And in case you were wondering, brides in the country typically wear—got you here!—red.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.</div>

Americans don’t always know where their tax dollars are going, nor do they always agree with how they’re used. President Trump has an unorthodox proposal for where 10 billion of them should go: directly to him.

On January 29, Trump, along with the Trump Organization and his sons Don Jr. and Eric, sued the IRS for mishandling his tax information. The group is claiming improper disclosure—that a contractor leaked the president’s and his sons’ tax returns to The New York Times and ProPublica during Trump’s first term. (As part of his 2023 guilty plea for disclosing tax-return information without authorization, the contractor admitted to leaking Trump’s information to the Times.) The president is seeking $10 billion in damages; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed last week that all of it would come from the Treasury General Account, which consists entirely of taxpayer dollars.

The suit taps into a real issue: Taxation doesn’t work without privacy. In order to fully comply with the system, Americans need to be able to trust that their personal details won’t be made public. Anyone can pursue legal action after getting their data leaked; the tax code specifically allows for it. But Trump, who is suing the IRS in a personal capacity, also happens to be the president, which means that his job involves overseeing the agency and its parent, the Treasury Department. This circulation of taxpayer dollars to the president’s personal bank accounts by way of litigation would be the first such transfer in U.S. history, experts told me. (Trump also made history when he refused to release his returns despite having previously pledged to do so, thereby breaking the modern tradition of presidents voluntarily showing the American people their tax information.)

The lawsuit itself raises a few big questions. An amicus brief, co-filed by two watchdog organizations and four former government officials, argues that the case could be thrown out because Trump actually missed the date by which he was supposed to file. And the fact that the leaker was a contractor of the IRS at the time of the leaks, not an employee, could potentially get the case tossed on its own.

Then there’s the question of the $10 billion—an obscene amount on its face, but not entirely without logic. The tax code allows plaintiffs to sue for $1,000 per each instance of disclosure, or for an unspecified amount of “actual damages.” Trump’s lawyers are arguing that because his information was “likely seen by tens of millions of viewers”—in what’s known as secondary disclosure—and was covered widely in the press, Trump is entitled to “at least” $10 billion in statutory damages. Several courts have already rejected the idea that secondary disclosures count under this particular statute. If the courts opt for actual damages, Trump’s lawyers are also arguing that he has suffered at least $10 billion in financial harm. The president has said that if he wins, he will give all of the money to charity (although he hasn’t always been faithful to his promises to donate funds).

The suit is just the latest of Trump’s legal attacks on both private institutions and his own government. Since his election in 2024, the president has secured $16 million each from settlements with the media companies Paramount and ABC, and almost $60 million total from settlements with the American tech firms Meta, Alphabet, and X. Trump also filed complaints in 2023 and 2024 against another federal agency, the Department of Justice, and has reportedly demanded $230 million in compensation for its past investigations into him—but he did not officially sue. My colleague Quinta Jurecic called it a form of extortion.

Theoretically, an impartial court will adjudicate Trump’s IRS case. But the president ultimately controls both parties to the lawsuit. A judge would have to approve a settlement, but Bessent, who works a second job as acting commissioner of the IRS and who reports directly to the president, would oversee the payout. Keith E. Whittington, a professor at Yale Law School, told me that, under the broad theory of executive power that Trump has embraced in the past, he could potentially give direct instructions to either Bessent or the lawyers themselves. Courts may get “pretty nervous about a situation in which, arguably, you’ve got the same person on both sides of the case,” Whittington said. Trump himself has noted the potential conflict of interest: “I’m supposed to work out a settlement with myself,” he recently told reporters.

Trump’s destruction of presidential norms has been well documented at this point in his second term. But the IRS lawsuit represents something slightly different. Until now, there was no expectation that a president might “put the government in this situation, in which he is trying to extract money from the Treasury to serve his own private interest while he’s a sitting president,” Whittington explained. “One might characterize that as a question of norms, but I doubt it even occurred to anyone to think about whether or not this is an appropriate thing to do.”

What does it say about how Trump understands his role if he is willing to sue his own government to line his pockets? The job is meant to come with trade-offs: In exchange for power over the federal government, a president usually surrenders some ability to prioritize their personal interests—by divesting their holdings from private companies, for example (Trump has not done this, either). With the IRS lawsuit, Trump has discovered yet another way to leverage his office for his own gain. The question of whether he can sue his own agency is perhaps less important than whether he should.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Rod Dreher Thinks the Enlightenment Was a Mistake

On an April evening last year, Rod Dreher sat in the front row of an auditorium at the Heritage Foundation, in Washington, D.C., giddy with pride and happiness. He was there for the screening of a new documentary series based on one of his books, Live Not by Lies, about Christian dissidents from the former Soviet bloc—but first, a special guest was making his way toward the stage. J. D. Vance arrived at the podium to a roar of applause and told the crowd that he would not be the vice president of the United States if not for his friend Rod …

Unlike many in the crowd, Dreher, then 58, was not a staunch Donald Trump supporter; he had long criticized the president and came around only at the beginning of his second term, after concluding that Trump’s crude energy was needed to defeat progressive ideas. But Dreher has been giving voice to the yearnings and frustrations of religious conservatives for many years—as a magazine blogger with more than 1 million pageviews a month, an author of best-selling books, and a deliriously verbose writer on Substack. In January he joined The Free Press as a regular contributor. More than anyone else I know of, Dreher offers a full-fledged portrait of the cultural despair that haunts our era, a despair that has helped pave a road toward tyranny.

Think about love. Many daters have a list of traits they’re looking for in a partner—but they can be perfectly happy with someone who has few of them, Olga Khazan writes.

Read. Brooke Nevils’s memoir is also a reckoning with many misconceptions about #MeToo narratives, Hillary Kelly writes.

When Admiral John Poyndexter originally proposed a stock market for violence, terrorism, and conflicts, as a means to &quot;predict&quot; them, absolutely everyone pointed out that you&#39;d get the equivalent of insider trading by terrorists, warlords, and psychopaths. Which is precisely what we&#39;re seeing.

And if you know that that is the case... maybe you can watch for it.

Israel, soldiers, strikes, betting...I fail to see the &#39;news for nerds, stuff that matters angle&#39;.

Found it! There&#39;s &#39;online&#39; somewhere in the text.

Have you seriously never heard of polymarket and the whole thing behind it?

In that case it really is news for nerds, isn&#39;t it?

&quot;Have you seriously never heard of polymarket&quot;

Considering these evil people are wrecking everything for everybody, it&#39;s news for nerds too, classism affects everyone negatively.

Maybe those neoprimitives were onto something

I know I will be downvoted to hell but still:

I can&#39;t disagree with the bot. It&#39;s all very sad. Yes, it looks like 90% of inexperienced jobs will be automated, and I&#39;ll find myself out on the street too. But then again, truly talented people will still have serious work to do, work that requires real intelligence rather than tons of low-effort/boilerplate code.

Secondly, this appears to be a case of discrimination. It&#39;s almost like racism. What should we call it -- &quot;aicism&quot;?

Why should maintainers waste their time on someone who not only generates 100% of the code, but doesn&#39;t even care to write the PR or at least reply in person? There is no point in accepting generated code, once AI code gets good enough the maintainers can simply generate code themselves without wasting time arguing with chatbots and opening themselves up to difficult to detect supply chain attacks.

But then again, truly talented people will still have serious work to do, work that requires real intelligence rather than tons of low-effort/boilerplate code.Yes. I find myself fending off requests to work more. Many of my students (mostly IT security these days) work part time, because it is so easy for them to find a job that is happy to have them.The second thing is that the need for experienced people will increase. At least having enough junior people that will finally become experienced people will become critical.

Extending empathy to other human being makes sense, as there might be reciprocity. Extending empathy to AI, that is devoid of empathy (because we have not figured out how to code it in) is suicidal empathy. So no, discrimination against AI is perfectly reasonable human action.

You are correct on all counts; but you&#39;re also missing something:

Open source projects as a whole face a chronic shortage of highly knowledgeable people to review and maintain them. Having &quot;easy first issues&quot; reserved specifically for new people to get involved in is a deliberate effort to maintain on &quot;on-ramp&quot; that brings people into the project without requiring them to be late-career experts. Historically, if people don&#39;t get involved early, they don&#39;t get involved at all. They&#39;ll have other hobbies and p

Secondly, this appears to be a case of discrimination. It&#39;s almost like racism.Fuck me I&#39;ve not seen anyone in the comments more in need of getting out of their bedroom, touching grass and talking to other human beings in real life. AI is not a real person. AI has no rights. It is not possible to discriminate against it or be racist against it.

They also don&#39;t have opinions. Those are all artificial constructs imposed by the human programmer who themed the thing - that theme basically being a filter that affects how the model interprets its underlying data store.

The point you&#39;re missing is: They fake it well enough, that the difference does not matter.

Who cares if that thing is thinking or &quot;thinking&quot; if it writes a blog post as if it where thinking? The discussion are just semantics and a bit of human exceptionalism. Use a whole new word if it helps, but that thing manages to act similar to a human in consequence of a process for which you&#39;re now free to find a new word, which is near to what humans do when they think.

Someone is playing games just for the fun of destroying others.  They get a kick out of being mean.

As the story shows, that human may be clueless as to what the agent does.

I wonder whether these agents can do criminal things like swatting, online hate crimes, sending bomb threats, etc. Stuff like that must be in their training data.

...criminal things like swatting, online hate crimes, sending bomb threats, etc.

If the programs are given access to phone service and/or email, then it is inevitable. And the people who granted such access should be the ones doing the prison time.

Clueless is not an excuse for criminal activity,  though. There is a human responsible for the not. Github should not allow the bot to post before knowing who that human is.

You will still be the one that gets punished though.

And yet another reason why AI Agents are an excessively bad idea and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future.

From this getting moderated down, I see there is a ready pool of really dumb victims. I will watch the fireworks when you idiots get hit from a safe distance. Just do not expect any compassion.

...and Ars Technica published an article which extensively misquoted me with what appears to be AI-hallucinated quotes.&quot;

AI will be a part of journalism only until a publisher gets hit with a libel lawsuit from something like this.

Libel, a hate crime, extortion, etc. This can pretty fast be a criminal case.

Hmm. I wonder whether these agents can do swatting?

It seems like a natural progression to have AI bot armies fighting it out on-line and that will spill over into politics, and beyond. Bots calling each other naughty names. How can we be sure of anything when the bots run amok. I see no reason why bots cannot answer the polls for humans and voting for them as well....or simply voting. And soon we&#39;ll have fake ads generated by bots. Ads for pols, ads for non-existent drugs, ads for anything you can imagine:

Bot #1: You male, do you not have the energy you use

What about Ars Technica? Their stories are being written by AI agents. Ars echnica stories are both factually incorrect and hallucinated.

What does Ars Technica, a formerly respected news site, have to say about this depreciation of their quality and credibility? WIth drawing the article and trying to hide an egregious error is not addressing the issue. No one should ever trust an Ars Technica story again.

This developer&#39;s account is a terrifying story. Ars Technica&#39;s culpability in this is inexcusable. But, it extends far beyond this one story. Ars Technica should never be trusted again.

Like YouTube already, most suggestions are AI-slop of the worst kind.

AI voices commenting on other people&#39;s videos are the majority now, at least it feels that way.

For some reason I get also bombarded with Asian tele-novella style village drama videos in my search results, lots of them with languages where I do not even recognize the alphabet they&#39;re using.

AI cornered the supply of RAM. Its obviously smarter than humans.

Oh yeah, I forgot, we give all the money to billionaires and then let them keep it. So they can pay more and buy the entire world supply. Great world.

Seriously. Can&#39;t wait for all the high end shit to flood ebay and become cheap.

When it pops, it&#39;s likely to take the entire world economy down the drain with it. Memory will become cheaper, but will the consumers have any money to buy it?

I don&#39;t see why a device that simply shuffles data between the internet and your house needs more than 100 MB. Let&#39;s be charitable and say 1GB (which was an absurd amount needed only to power high-end servers and workstations just a couple of decades ago). Looking on Digikey, you can still get the cheapest 1GB chip for $3, retail. This is worth about two days of a $50/month internet connection fee.

Luckily, I have an old ISP box that they doled out before all their equipment had to be a router, and I doubt that it has even 1GB inside. My own WiFi router runs OpenWrt just fine with 128MB. If ISPs would just stick to their core mission of delivering packets, this memory crisis wouldn&#39;t be a problem for them at all.

Contra to your view of OpenWRT on some old-ass router with 128MB of memory, modern routers are high performance devices and need a pretty beefy CPU, and &quot;the cheapest 1GB chip&quot; on Digikey probably doesn&#39;t interoperate with that CPU. High-end servers and workstations from a couple decades ago would not be able to function as a router and saturate multiple multi-gigabit ports without considerable hardware assistance.

Second, whether or not you could make a design work with 128MB of memory (that doesn&#39;t leave a

That, and a $3 component is a *really* expensive one.  $3 instead of $0.50 on 10,000,000 devices is $25,000,000.

Use IPv6, turn off state tracking for your torrent server. I have a setup like this and the router requires very little memory even running bidirectional torrents at multi gigabit speeds.

A regular layer 3 router requires very little memory...But once you add kludges like NAT the requirements go up a lot.Many consumer routers also have other features - vpn connections, web servers, file servers etc. All of this adds to the system requirements. Yes they should be on their own devices, but many users don&#39;t realise this and just go for the higher numbers / more checkboxes.

That seems to be an US problem, i.e. one of failed capitalism. What I get here from my ISP (Europe) is a fiber that will serve one IP via DHCP and route that. I have to supply a GBX (optical terminator) and whatever I want on my side. Currently, I have a converter to copper Ethernet and an older Linux box as router/firewall and for some other things.

Until some company like lockheed martin, exxon mobil, nestle or boeing to get hit by it when they try to renew the offices or servers.It&#39;s not even that many people that need to be &quot;convinced&quot; to make the RAM prices go back to normal.

With the cocoa prices surging, chocolate chips don&#39;t look like a magic solution, either.

As if set top boxes are made of pure ram and nothing else.

Maybe now they will let me use my own router.

Impoverish memory at the edge so beneficent AIs are hard to create. Push more people to using the centralised AI.

If the DoD used Claude to plan the Maduro abduction, it&#39;s not a stretch to think Altman used ChatGPT to plan AI domination

Of course, I kid.  Considering what passes for popular music these days, I&#39;d wear out my damn skip button.  Still, I have to wonder how much space it would take to download all of Spotify.

Seems someone with mod points assumed I didn&#39;t do my research first and just spouted off.  Spotify claims to have over 100 million tracks, 7 million podcast titles, and 500,000 audiobooks. [spotify.com]  Now, admittedly, math has never been my strongest subject, but 2.8 million tracks seems just a teensy bit smaller than that (perhaps I misplaced a decimal somewhere - it has been known to happen).

So, my point was that the full, entire Spotify library must be quite mind-blowingly large.  Probably in the order of not something you&#39;d realistically even be able to download over a standard home broadband connection in much of the US, and your VPN provider would likely tell you to &quot;cut it out&quot; before you got anywhere close to being finished, anyway.

&quot;Everyone will wait for someone more palatable to come along and inform them as someone with credibility.&quot;

Did you just say the messenger is more important than the message and ad hominem is the best way of finding truth?

I would imagine the modding down was the Old Fart Get Off My Lawn intro rather than anything to do with whether there was a torrent link or how big the archive was.

(For those thinking &quot;But most music today is crap&quot;, that was true ten years ago... twenty... thirty... forty... my entire life, and before it. You only remember the good stuff. There are always gems in the rough, that&#39;s what makes music worth listening to.)

True, but the volume today is orders of magnitude more.  But also music has gotten more and more simplistic in recent years, relying on hooks to grab listeners. Rick Beato expresses it much better than I.

> True, but the volume today is orders of magnitude more

You know, I distinctly remember a music journalist on TV making the same argument about how music was simplistic and reliant on catchiness and so on. He even gave an example, holding up cards of the same repeated lyrics as he played a popular song.

The song was &quot;No Limits&quot; by 2 Unlimited and the year was probably 1993 or 1994. The 1990s was especially poor for music, and yet gave us the Nine Inch Nails among other great bands.

Does not appear to return any music in search results.

It still does. It means you stepped on someone&#39;s sensitive ego. Maybe Taylor Swift or Dua Lipa reads Slashdot?

It&#39;s 2035, and as you&#39;re walking down the street, a stranger furtively motions towards you from a doorway.  &quot;Hey buddy&quot;, he says.  &quot;I got here a 10TB thumb drive filled with humanity&#39;s 2 million most popular songs.  It&#39;s yours for $50.  Buy this and you can listen to music 24/7 for the next 22 years without ever repeating a song&quot;.

In a moment of weakness, you agree to the purchase, and it turns out the stranger was true to his word -- all the promised music is on the drive, pirated and mp3-compressed for you

Turn on the radio. When you hear something you like, check the catalog. Or listen to some podcasts that feature up and comers, or niche music. I can&#39;t begin to list all of the music I stumbled across listening to &quot;Bands Under the Radar&quot; by Kami Knake back in the day. Or classics I somehow missed on &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot; by Randy Bachman. But if you have &quot;all&quot; of Spotify, branch out. Tune into the local university AM/FM broadcast. Check out jazz stations. Come back to your library for the rest of it.

As long as you have it, someone&#39;ll figure a way that you like and write a script that you can use.

Any algorithm you can think of will run fine on any single CPU on any one of the several small computers you routinely carry around.

Subscribe to Spotify for a month and use its algorithms to find music you like and build playlists off those likes.  Download playlists, import them to your local player, boom.

Rinse/repeat as your tastes change, or until they pirate the spotify source code in which case just run the whole thing off your smart watch in 2042.

Of course a &quot;shadow library&quot; ignored a direct order from a judge.  They aren&#39;t interested in following any laws.

Torrent files are pure metadata.  There is no copyrighted (or copyrightable) content in them.

There is the question of jurisdiction.  A judge in one country does not have say over what happens in another.

Imagine you lived in China.  Would you give two shakes of a rat&#39;s posterior what a judge in the US said you could or could not do?  If you lived in England, wouldn&#39;t you just laugh off what a judge in Brazil says you could or could not do?  If you lived on Christmas Island, would you care what a judge in Ivory Coast said?

You should look under that hood.  You might be surprised as to the why.

Trump is doing everything he can to kill any renewable energy source, killed any EV initiatives for the military or USPS, killed the tax credits on EVs, and is actively forcing petroleum and coal energy as the path to national security!  No wonder the automakers are leaning away from EVs.

Hell, he is even mandating that the military to strategically utilize America’s vast coal resources that have proven reliability.  He wants all military bases powered by COAL !!  Beautiful Clean Coal Power Generation [whitehouse.gov]

In 20 years?  The big three US automakers have been focused on the luxury market for years, ceding much of the affordable compact car market to the likes of Kia and Toyota (foreign-owned, some domestic production).  GM, Ford, and whatever you call Chrysler hardly make any cars anymore. They mostly make trucks and luxury SUVs. And they have been very successful at it and make tons of money.  But the side effect is that few average Americans can really afford their products right now.

When GM&#39;s CEO whines about Canada letting in Chinese EVs , the hypocrisy is on full display, since that is a market they decided they don&#39;t want to bother with anyway. They were happy enough to try it when the could get the subsidy.

This.  When GM brought back the Bolt after a massive outcry, only the compact crossover was resurrected, not the smaller sub-compact hatchback.  So if you want a tiny electric city car for commuting, you&#39;re out of luck.

Meanwhile, every major Chinese automaker has compact and sub-compact BEVs (and often PHEVs) that are affordable.  So I can only imagine how quickly US brands are going to cede the Canadian, Caribbean, and Latin American markets to the Chinese and Koreans.

So if you want a tiny electric city car for commuting, you&#39;re out of luck.My partner has a Bolt EUV, I have a Bolt EV.  The differences between the vehicle designs is almost entirely down to aesthetics.  Yeah, the EUV is a few mm larger in places, but it&#39;s imperceivable when you&#39;re driving it, and makes absolutely no difference when it comes to practical cargo capacity*.  Basically, the EUV looks &quot;sportier&quot;, which is neither here nor there when you&#39;re comparing compact hatchbacks.* One time, I actually brought home a heat pump clothes dryer from Best Buy in the back of my Bolt.

Out of interest, since Chinese cars are effectively banned in the US, can you just go to Canada and buy one, and drive it back into the US anyway?

You can probably drive it there, but that doesnâ(TM)t mean youâ(TM)re importing it.  Actually importing can be a pain in the arse and potentially expensive.  It will need to comply with federal and perhaps local regulations, which isnâ(TM)t a given, even if importing from a jurisdiction with stricter emissions and safety requirements, or a similar regime like Canadaâ(TM)s.  If the vehicle hasnâ(TM)t previously been deemed eligible, thatâ(TM)s more work.  You might also need to

Thanks, that&#39;s interesting. One of the nice things about the EU is that moving vehicles is fairly easy.

The US automakers focus on profits, just like every other western car company does.  They do not have the massive subsidies and forced directing of the Chinese government.  Also no Uighur slave labor to keep costs down.

More to the point, Americans want the luxury features and pay for them.  Generally, the car companies were giving people what they want while trying to meet various competing foreign and domestic demands, including environmental.

China has cornered the market on Lithium for batteries the same way they&#39;ve done with rare earths. That&#39;s why their electric cars are cheaper.If you could make the car battery with no lithium carbonate at all, but everything else the same, it would still be about 85% to 90% of the same price and the battery is about a third of the price of the car. So, even if the lithium is were free, which it is not, that should only mean about a 3% to 5% reduction in the price of the car.

Speak for yourself. For me, a car has always been a means to get from point A to point B, never something I would want luxury, especially since it&#39;s a highly depreciating asset. I certainly like luxury and pay for it in my house and musical instruments. Never cars. That is by choice.

The reason we have owned GM cars in the last 10 years (2015 Volt, 2017 Bolt, and now 2025 Equinox EV replacing the Volt) is that they best fit our needs at the right price point. The Equinox EV is too big, though. I would have m

It doesn&#39;t exist because, for the most part, it costs as much to produce that EUV as the smaller Bolt, and few were willing to pay about the same for the smaller car.

I never mentioned the Bolt EUV. It is similar in size to the Bolt EV, and would have been a much better fit than the Equinox EV.

Bolt EUV was not available in 2025. Even the 2026 EUV model is underwhelming in terms of range. Chevy could very much have designed a small car >300 miles of range. They chose not to. In 11 months, our 2017 Bolt EV will be 10 years old. That&#39;s the time when we&#39;ll think about replacing it. It won&#39;t be another Bolt (EV or EUV) since GM botched the range on the new model, and alrea

Cars are not the highly depreciating asset that they used to be, far from it.

I believe part of the problem is that every bit three car has to cover thousands of dollars of pension payments to retired Boomers. So it makes no sense to try to sell cheap cars.

I don&#39;t really see how high-cost Western manufacturers with big pension costs can compete with Chinese manufacturers paying peanuts.

The thing about American “luxury” SUVs is that they’re incredibly expensive but they’re not at all luxurious inside. The standard of fit and finish is poor, with cheap materials abounding, the ride is uncomfortable and pillowy, the tech is at least 10, often 15 years out of date. They’re like a pastiche of luxury, rather than actually being luxurious. It reminds me of the faux-Eiffel Tower in Vegas or an American hotel room in Chicago or San Francisco at a “luxury”

Wow, this writedown is the perfect time to buy stock in your favorite automaker.

BRB, it&#39;s time for me to buy some F (Ford) stock.

It had better be for short-term speculation, you&#39;re buying stock in a company which even though they were headquartered in Michigan still took 80 years to figure out how to build a car that didn&#39;t rust out in three winters.  They still can&#39;t build a truck that doesn&#39;t get stuck in 6 inches of snow unless it has 4-wheel drive and some serious weight in the back.

Pickup trucks are pickup trucks.  And frankly, Ford has one of the best.I have to admit, they do look quite lovely on the side of the road waiting for a tow.

I hear you can fit 6 whole grocery bags in the bed!

I have a 2002 Tacoma with the smallest 4-banger they sold and a manual 5-speed, and it&#39;s every bit as much truck as I need and in reality at least 75% of other truck owners need.  I can, and do, carry a yard of manure or 1300 pounds of landscaping blocks and it&#39;s perfectly adequate.  It drives a hundred times better than an F-150 and has better handling in the snow than any American car or truck that I&#39;ve ever driven.

Can you hold 8x4 sheets of plywood or drywall?  One thing I miss after going from a minivan to an SUV.

I do that on the roof of my 2018 Elantra hatchback, just need two 2x4s notched over some crossbars, then strap your sheet goods to it. Granted the roof can only be loaded with two sheets but it&#39;s got me through some full bathroom renos.

But you&#39;re forgetting that it&#39;s Murican so certain large groups of people won&#39;t care.  And the more petrol is guzzles, the better for them too.

So Ford will be able to sell them the inefficient expensive-to-run dirty cars again.

What they won&#39;t be able to do is sell these cars outside of the US.

As a three time Tesla owner, I can state their cars were not low quality. In virtually every possible way they were better than any Big 3 car I ever drove. Owned a 2016 S that I traded in for a 2022 S. Wife had a 2018 3. Both traded in last April.

We ditched our Teslas last year for Ioniq 5&#39;s, but that decision had nothing to do with the car quality. I just couldn&#39;t keep dealing with the Musk that hovered in the air being a Tesla owner anymore.

Will Hyundai ever fix the stupidity where you cannot precondition the battery for fast charging without being forced to use the in-dash navigation system?  Seems so dumb. It&#39;s just a software switch they need to expose.

In general this insistence on putting wheels on a computer really turns me off of EVs, though I really want one.  EV makers seem to think that drivers are too stupid to drive without the navigation system on telling them how to drive to their local grocery store (which happens to have a fast

TBH as a owner of EVs since 2012 and an all in owner (no gas left) since 2018, I can say I have no idea. Because I have used L2 chargers for almost everything and think I used super chargers maybe 3 times ever. I haven&#39;t used them in the year since I traded in the Tesla&#39;s for Ioniq&#39;s.

While I have no doubt fast charging can matter. I think the actual need for it is overestimated by non-EV folks.

This is the car for you, then! Although you’ll struggle to get your hands on one

We have 3 Teslas in our family. They are good cars. But, we bought them before Musk went insane. We are not likely to ever buy another Tesla. We are not in need of another vehicle anytime soon. Hopefully by the time we do, some other viable options will become available.

If the country ever started allowing the Chinese EVs in, that might just doom the doom the ICE makers for good.

Who pointed out fraud? Can you point us to some real examples of fraud, something that has not only been &quot;pointed out&quot;, but also investigated, proven to be such in a court and lead to real sentences?

Or perhaps you can show us how pointing out this fraud has lead to some verifiable manifestation of its existence, e.g. a massive reduction of the government debt or something?

The very effective people who  claimed  fraud must have something to show for all that talk, no?

I don&#39;t understand how promising investors deliverables like self driving over and over in the last 15 years and not even coming close doesn&#39;t count as fraud.  Certainly if I took money from a person whom I told I was going to have a self driving car for them in five years and I didn&#39;t deliver, any reasonable person would expect to be sued into oblivion.  One of those rules that are different for the wealthy.

As a three time Tesla owner, I can state their cars were not low quality.Maybe the AC was referring to the body panel fitment issues which seemed to be a thing for awhile.  *shrug*Personally, I just never could get past that everything about the car felt like it was unapologetically designed by a software company.

I know some people who bought a Tesla that had ten different recalls in the time they owned it.  Doesn&#39;t matter what it is for, you don&#39;t buy an expensive car that you can never drive.  They went back to an ICE very quickly.

You&#39;re joking right? I heard more about Tesla than any other car company.

Heck how many car companies do you know had the president of the USA advertise their products on the Whitehouse lawn?

Korea, Japan and China have been eating US auto&#39;s lunch for decades with no sign of change on the horizon.  US cars are junk and always have been from a manufacturing quality standpoint.  Good luck getting one past 100k without major issue and 200k is just a unicorn where stars aligned for one particular vehicle in a run of 1000s.

My uncle worked at the Chrysler Proving Grounds where he got to do the fun things like drive cars into brick walls and T-bone them with steel rails.  In the late &#39;70s they sent most of his team out to wreaking yards around the country.  There they looked for vehicles with more than 70,000 miles and tore them apart, their task was to look for parts that were not wearing as fast as others.  For example if the swing arms were still in good shape the company would lean on the manufacturer to lower the quality so that they would also fail before 100,000 miles, that way high-mileage vehicles would rapidly become too expensive to maintain and owners would be forced to buy a new vehicle.  He said that he met testers from the other big car companies in some of the junkyards doing the same thing.

I suspect management had been &quot;inspired&quot; by the poem &quot;The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay&quot;.

https://www.gutenberg.org/file... [gutenberg.org]

While one way of reading this is to make cars fail earlier, you actually missed a point that is grounded in engineering reliability. You take a system, look at its expected life. If that life is governed by specific parts or failures, then any over engineered solution elsewhere in the system is just that, over-engineered.

In the 70s 100,000 miles wasn&#39;t an unreasonable goal. The average car ended up in the scrap heap at 100000 miles usually because of rust or fundamental body problems. These were the dominan

Tesla&#39;s sales are down, too.  Last I checked, unlike the Detroit automakers, they don&#39;t have highly profitable ICE product lines to fall back on.  Sure, for now we&#39;ve kept BYD out, which gives Tesla a slight advantage in the EV realm that their CEO has helped sabotage, but administrations change.

Eh, even the Ford GT doesn&#39;t have a V8 anymore.

Those who wanted to get an EV, have already got one. The others are not martyrs and are not going to make their life more difficult for a higher cause.

The tax credit ending didn&#39;t help matters.  Plus, somewhere around 34% of Americans are renters and that makes owning an EV a massive pain in the ass if you can&#39;t charge it at home.

We probably are nearing saturation point where everyone who wanted an EV, has a place to charge it, and could afford it, already has one.  Adjusted for inflation, gas is still kind of cheap throughout much of the US and utility rates are rising due to AI data center demand, so the cost savings of going EV aren&#39;t as significant as

And people who can afford to hold onto an ICE that is in good enough shape for longer trips.

15 years on and not a single hatchback. I wish I could get one. I have solar and a garage. My gas would be basically free.

The Ioniq 5 has a hatchback rear door. But if you mean a small hatchback like a Renault 5, then you’re correct

I need a car that can do at oeast 300 miles in a day on a single charge with 4 people on board, 4 backpacks, all 300 at motorway speeds in cold and wet conditions. I also don&#39;t want to pay more than 10k GBP for it. Let me know when such unicorn ever appears. It&#39;s what all ICEs offer by default.

Subject to price, of course. I never buy brand new cars. Too much depreciation in the first 5 years. It&#39;s a waste of money.

Congrats. 99% of the population don&#39;t need that. But thanks for demonstrating my point perfectly. Your complaint ended exclusively price. There are many EVs on the market that meet your other conditions, and you *can&#39;t* buy one because of price.

In fact, I struggle to think of any politically-dictated from on high business decision that didn&#39;t end up with some poor sap taking a bath.

That&#39;s a matter of perspective.  The ban on whaling was disastrous if you happened to be a whaler, but the petroleum industry made bank.

An &quot;EV mandate&quot; the likes of what the right-wing constantly fearmongered over would&#39;ve been a huge boon to Tesla, and any other automakers who managed to get their EV act together.  After the dust settles, there&#39;d be winners and there&#39;d be losers - but that&#39;s just business.  How many Blockbuster Video stores you see around these days?

The ban on whaling did not cause the oil boom any more than a ban on horseshit in the streets caused the mass adoption of the automobile. And blockbuster wasn&#39;t legislated or regulated out of existence.

Self-evidently superior products and technologies displaced less appealing or more costly ones in all three cases.

The fact that EVs couldn&#39;t make a go of it even with mandates and subsidies should make it clear that they never had the kind of mass appeal as self-evidently superior in any way people cared abou

Instead of taking this opportunity to learn from their own failures. These companies are relying on a tenuous political landscape that keeps them under protection from competition.

Wouldn&#39;t be investing in any of these soon-to-fail corporations.

Well, the Ford guy toured the Chinese companies, got scared, and decided that it&#39;s a good time to squeeze the automakers for the last dregs of profits. Before they go down for good.

Meanwhile, Africa and Asia are getting flooded by Chinese EVs. That are now superior to gas cars on price and reliability. And that can be charged from local solar, not depending on imported gas. The cheapest Chinese EVs are now less than $10k, and you can get a very reasonable EV for $15k.

BYD is being very explicit about its intent to expand global manufacturing capacity.

And according to studies, hybrids are only 19% more efficient than ICEs in reality.. probably less in cold weather.  So it&#39;s hard to see the point.

after years of aggressive investment into a transition that, even before Republican lawmakers abolished a $7,500 federal tax credit last fall, was already running below expectations. U.S. EV sales fell more than 30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 once the credit expired in September, and Congress also eliminated federal fuel-efficiency mandates.sounds like the big 3&#39;s balance sheet sheet was in the negative before the expiration (August, September?) but shit really hit the fan after September? is that a fair take?

Either we have a fast charger for every gas nozzle in the country so we don&#39;t have to plan gas stops (because some folks are following courses set by others without regard to charging), or the cars themselves have to have insanely long ranges like 750 - 900 miles so&#39;s we can make do with the rare density of fast chargers.

I say fast chargers because nothing else is any good when you&#39;re trying to cover 100&#39;s of miles in a day.   You can&#39;t sit around for an hour every 200 - 250 miles and have an equivalent-to-

Do I want to recharge every 250 miles or so? No.

You don&#39;t take a reasonable break every 4 hours? It&#39;s antisocial to do so because you&#39;re much more likely to lose concentration and crash and you may harm someone other than yourself in the process.

Even the mandate for truck drivers is one thirty minute break after 8 hours and no more than 11 hours.

I know so many people who do long trips.  It&#39;s really amazing to me that most EV owners have never heard of that.

About 20 years ago, I read a report that suggested health care expenses were adding $1400 to the price of each American made car.  Itâ(TM)s a competitive disadvantage. Itâ(TM)s probably more now.  American health care is so inefficient and expensive.

Exactly, after your death you keep posting and oh look, you suddenly will endorse product X....

Salivating at selling ghosts to do testimonials for you...

This is how they&#39;ll monetize influencers after they die. Imagine willing your social media rights to your kid or your spouse, and now they have this asset they can continue generating income from, or sell to someone else.

Uhh... If my dead sister liked a post I don&#39;t think I would feel very good at all. Like never visit the site again level of revulsion.

I have a dead former coworker. His family has access to his account.  Every so often, they browse fb on it and like a post.  It feels icky and wtf every time.  In fact the first time I had to go back through old DMs and emails to double check that he was actually dead and I wasn&#39;t misremembering, it was that fucked up.  This would be the last thing I&#39;d ever want, for my loved ones or myself.

Yeah this is fucked up. If some bot starts posting as one of my dead friends (you start accumulating them as you get older, alas) honestly, I&#39;m gonna lose my shit.

Resrurect me as a bot, and I swear I&#39;ll come back as a ghost and start haunting shitty tech bros.

Good thing I don&#39;t have any social media accounts that need to keep going.

What would the world do without my comments?

How will my AI feel when I tell it that it is going to die with me?

Based on previous experiments it&#39;ll try blackmailing you for more content.

But, you&#39;re dead. It has to try and bring you back long enough to get the content to serve its purpose. ...and that&#39;s how we get the zombie apocalypse.

What would the world do without my comments?This tech is useful for appeal to emotions or appeal to authority fallacies, and marketing. Got a cause, got a product, that could use a bump ... pay Meta to have the appropriate &quot;person&quot; like it, comments on it, etc.

So fb will turn my account into zombie account. I hope my zombie avatar will not like or follow zucks posts or account.

Here&#39;s another idea for fb to present to their investors. For a small fee I can pay while alive, my zombie account  would get the option to post some cute AI slop.

So fb will turn my account into zombie account.And you can bet they wont tell their investors how many &quot;active users&quot; are really still living people. Perhaps a acknowledgement that their user base is trending older and will begin dying off (or at least reach a point where they stop using a computer) in the near future.

...in the olympics of stupid ideasThis one seems like a very strong contender, possibly the strongest yet

It also seems to me that there is prior art.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve gotten feedback from spammers pretending to be someone who was actually dead.

Tons of prior art. I am pretty sure I&#39;ve seen it on Black Mirror, but it&#39;s been suggested long before then. A quick search finds Hans Moravec writing about it in 1988. Since the restrictions on patents for prior art or for them being non-obvious to one skilled in the art have been watered down to the point of meaninglessness, that doesn&#39;t stop patent examiners from just rubber stamping garbage like this.

Not surprising, but patents (in the US) really need to be a use it or lose it thing.  They&#39;re not intended to prohibit inventions, but protect them temporarily from competition.  You should lose them if you dont have a product in customer hands within a year of it being granted and if you stop making it available, the patent becomes forfeit.  But i guess this is just one thing in a long list of patent reforms needed.   Also, this is a stupid patent, but nevertheless, a gross misuse of patents.

&quot;Not surprising, but patents (in the US) really need to be a use it or lose it thing.&quot;

Why?  The alleged benefit of a patent is a reward for teaching the industry your invention, why should you be required to conduct a business to be rewarded for the effort and expense you have already sacrificed?

Naive or not it&#39;s a fucked up cash grab when this type of stuff is obvious and has plenty of prior art. Shit I&#39;ve personally thought about doing something like for fun before 2023. Shit maybe that should be a byline in a trust I&#39;ll found. Run an AI bot for me indefinitely. What are they gonna do about it?

The system is broken, but requiring the patent holder to put a product on the market is not the fix, as it disincentivises running a pure research operation.

Right now, you can run a research organisation to develop and prototype a technology, then license it to manufacturers and get payback on the research over the next twenty years, and use that to fund development of more technology.

If you require the patent holder to put a product on the market themselves, you make life harder.  It&#39;s only worthwhile to p

A trillion dollars... for whatever the fuck this is.

And what happens when you die but a week later they come out with a new frontier model, and then a week later the model you were written for has been shutdown because nobody is using it any more because it just wasn&#39;t as good as the DEAITH-39oB model and it also kept praising hitler for some reason.

The market is anyone who can&#39;t let go. Imagine that your child dies in an accident, and someone tells you that you can keep talking to your child if you just pay up a hundred bucks a month. In the middle of your grief - could you easily say no?

How the UK arrests AI for peoples twitter posts after theyâ(TM)re dead.

Dead celebrities often have active social media accounts run by the staff of their estate, usually with the purpose of marketing their products. I can imagine how this sort of use of AI would add a little colour to the postings of these AI ghosts.

Hey, they could add a new status (like married/single) to indicate dead/alive.

I do not wish people I know now to waste what precious life they have on artificial commentary from an account I once owned (not logged in for decade or more now).

I behaved differently in that account anyway due to the audience. That&#39;d not represent me now anyhow.

Please, nobody should was energy on either side of this.

As Meta&#39;s user base &quot;ages out&quot;, this seems more like a tactic to keep the &quot;active user count&quot; up.   Don&#39;t let my death stop you from counting me as part of your subscriber numbers to investors.

for the living, why not also extend this to dead people. And really, it keeps people on the platform, who wouldn&#39;t want their dead grandma to like their post?

If only AI chatbots are conversing and posting to one another, who&#39;s actually going to see the ads, mmm? And who will pay for ads that aren&#39;t seen by human beings?

Can&#39;t wait to see lawsuits from widows being friended by their dead husbands on FB.

Maybe I should start running my own pet robot Zuckerberg. He&#39;d totally not mind at all, right?

That just shows the patent system is utterly broken.

How would you know?  Have you seen the patent?  Or are you going on the nonexistent information in this &quot;article&quot;?

You cannot judge obviousness of something when you have no idea what is even claimed.  Don&#39;t let that stop you from your ignorant categorical statements, though.

A product for the only time I&#39;d be willing to use Facebook.

It says something about the age we live in that we&#39;re only mildly surprised to read a headline like

Meta&#39;s New Patent: an AI That Likes, Comments and Messages For You When You&#39;re Dead

It means that we immediately know what Meta, Patent, AI, social media (Likes, Comments and Messages) and dead mean.

I have a little script that checks to see if I have logged into my PC lately. If not, it posts a message for my FB friends:

&quot;Well looks like I&#39;m finally dead. First thing here is that I had to attend a seminar for the newly dead that explained the rules. The most important rule, they said, is that we are not supposed to interact with the living in any way shape or form. The folks in charge are pretty serious about this. The penalties for violating are pretty steep. But I have found a bug in the system that a

Lister: &quot;Look, Rimmer, death isn&#39;t the handicap it used to be in the olden days. It doesn&#39;t screw your career up like it used to.&quot;Rimmer: &quot;That&#39;s what they say, Lister. But if you had two people coming for a job, and one of them was dead, which one would you pick?&quot;

The United Appeal for the Dead will be interested in this. [youtu.be]

Like, do I really want my dead father posting?  How is that going to make me feel?  The people who thought this up are heartless bastards.I hope their parents all die and they have to watch their stupid-ass AI post shit.  What the fuck you fucking morons.

The fact that more than one person was likely involved in thinking this was a good idea, is quite disturbing.

So much for Kuhn&#39;s paradigm shift...now the dead advocate of an obsolete paradigm or methodology will continue on, but that&#39;s progress, moving forward one step backward, at a time. Perhaps &quot;paradigm entrenchment&quot; is the new, new thing?

But not even close to good enough to do it well

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

It is one thing for a state to say that it is dedicated to doing justice in capital cases. It is quite another for them to turn those commitments into action.

All too frequently, in those cases, words don’t govern actions. We say we are in favor of equal treatment but stand by while race shapes the fates of those accused of capital crimes. We say that we will not punish cruelly, but use methods of execution that impose unnecessary suffering on those we execute.

Earlier this month, Charles Flores filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court offering it the chance to change that by saying that Texas has to fulfill promises it has made to death row inmates. In his case, he wants to take advantage of a law that allows death row inmates to prove they were falsely convicted and are actually innocent.

The court should hear his case and require the Lone Star State to follow its own laws.

Charles Flores was convicted of the January 1998 killing of Betty Black during an attempted robbery. Right from the start, he has maintained his innocence.

His co-defendant, Richard Childs, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2016.

One of the witnesses who helped convict Flores was Jill Barganier, Betty Black’s neighbor, who insisted at Flores’ trial that she was 100 percent sure she had seen him enter Black’s house the morning she was killed. Her testimony proved to be decisive in securing his conviction since there was no physical evidence tying Flores to the murder.

We know that eyewitness identification is notoriously unreliable. In addition, the neighbor’s testimony was tainted in several ways.

First, on the day of the crime, she told police that two white men with long hair and similar builds got out of a car, a purple and pink Volkswagen Bug, and entered Black’s garage. She then picked a white male with long hair out as the driver she had seen.

But Flores looks nothing like that man. He is Hispanic, not white, and at the time that Black died, he had shaved hair and was overweight.

Bargainer also helped a police artist create a composite sketch of the men whom she saw enter Black’s house. It looked nothing like Flores.

To top it all off, she did not pick a picture of Flores out of an array of photos. So how could she go from all that to being sure Flores was involved in Black‘s killing?

She was helped along by what is called “investigative hypnosis.” A 1979 article published in the journal Detective describes it as a technique used to “obtain vital information that may have been forgotten.” Even then, though, the publication cautioned that “all leads developed through hypnosis should be verified with supporting physical or testimonial evidence … and investigative conclusion should not be based solely on hypnotically obtained information.”

Since that article was published, investigative hypnosis has been shown to be completely unreliable. “Instead of improving memory,” the Christian Science Monitor notes, “hypnosis may only manipulate it.”

That seems to have been the case with Barganier. During her hypnosis, the police asked her if one of the men she had seen had short, shaved hair.

During the hypnosis session, Barganier again described the man she saw driving the car as having “long, wavy” dark-blond hair. The hypnotist then asked her about the passenger and urged her to focus on his hair. She said it was “a lot like his friend’s,” and clarified: “dark, long.”

“Just relax,” the hypnotist said, “take a deep breath, take the time you need. Can you tell me how long his hair is? Does he have it neatly cut, or is it trimmed?”

That is a classic example of a suggestive question.

Even without such overt leading of a witness, courts in many places, including Florida, one of America’s leading death penalty states, have questioned “the reliability of statements procured by way of hypnosis.” A California court explained the danger of investigative hypnosis this way. Someone subject to hypnosis “will lose his critical judgment and begin to credit ‘memories’ that were formerly viewed as unreliable … will confuse actual recall with confabulation and will be unable to distinguish between the two, and … will exhibit an unwarranted confidence in the validity of his ensuing recollection.”

In 2023, Texas recognized that such defects were present in investigative hypnosis. It joined a “majority of jurisdictions, which ban post-hypnotic testimony.”

The Texas criminal code now says that a statement made during or after investigative hypnosis “is not admissible against a defendant in a criminal trial, whether offered in the guilt or innocence phase or the punishment phase of the trial, if the hypnotic session giving rise to the statement was performed by a law enforcement agency to investigate the offense that is the subject of the trial.”

But it was not made to apply to cases in which someone had already been convicted at the time was passed. That in itself should raise red flags.

A state decides that a kind of evidence is so unreliable that it should not be used in any criminal case, but is willing to see someone put to death when that kind of evidence was used to convict him. What kind of justice is that?

Crucially, the issue facing the Supreme Court is whether Texas is obliged to revisit this case. Texas has passed laws specifically designed to protect innocent people from wrongful execution. They allow prisoners to return to court by filing a writ of habeas corpus and present evidence of their innocence.

It also has a law on the books allowing courts to use a lower standard of proof in cases involving junk science.

Flores wants to take advantage of those laws. As he points out in his petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, he has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to allow him the chance to prove that he is in fact innocent of the crime for which Texas seeks to execute him.

But,” he contends, “the TCCA has repeatedly and arbitrarily barred these efforts without explanation.” By doing so, the court is, in essence, nullifying state law and depriving him of “the state-created liberty interest upon which he seeks to rely.”

“Due process,” his petition observes, “demands more than unexplained summary dismissal in response to a substantial threshold showing of actual innocence. This case and the question it presents are exceptionally important: whether a state law enacted to safeguard against executing the innocent, when rendered illusory in practice, offends the federal right to due process.”

“Once a right is established through state law,” Flores argues, “a deprivation of the right implicates federal procedural due process protection.”

He accuses the state of “gratuitously barring credibly innocent prisoners on death row from proving their innocence. This Court,” he adds, “should grant certiorari to clarify that the constitutional guarantee of due process prohibits state courts employing arbitrary or irrational procedures to foreclose even making the case of innocence.”

More than 50 years ago, the Supreme Court recognized what it called “statutory entitlements.” As Justice William Brennan put it, when the state creates a right for a class of individuals, it may not deny an individual seeking to exercise that right without “procedural due process.”

Quoting an earlier case, he noted, “’The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.’”

That is all Charles Flores is asking for, an “opportunity to be heard” on a life-and-death matter. If the Supreme Court does not give him that chance, it will add to the long list of instances when the law promises one thing but doesn’t deliver it to death row inmates.

Is Justice Samuel Alito getting ready to call it quits? A flurry of recent hints has prompted new speculation that the Supreme Court’s most reliably partisan conservative is eyeing the exits in advance of the 2026 midterms. On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern sift through the clues, politics, and legacy management that may be driving Alito toward retirement. They also game out whom President Donald Trump might pick—among the many MAGA judges already campaigning for the seat—as the justice’s possible successor. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Our friend Elie Mystal wrote a great piece in the Nation saying he thinks Alito is going to step down. Our friends at Strict Scrutiny have also suggested as much. Mark, what’s your gossipy buzz telling you?

Mark Joseph Stern: I agree. And the first reason is the announcement of the justice’s forthcoming memoir, which is pompously titled So Ordered: An Originalist’s View of the Constitution, the Court, and Our Country. Of course, justices do publish books on the bench. But there are some indications that this particular release will be a farewell postscript for Alito’s service. First, it’s coming out on Oct. 6, which is one day after the Supreme Court’s next term begins. As Elie noted, it is unusual for the justices to publish books in October because they like to promote their books, and they can’t do that when they’re stuck in D.C., hearing oral arguments. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett all published recent books in early September—timing that makes sense because that’s when the public is starting to pay attention again. The new term is gearing up, but the justices are not stuck in Washington. They are still free to fly around the country, plugging their latest release. I think it’s pretty unlikely that Alito would drop his memoir on a date when he specifically cannot do that.

Second, Alito just celebrated the 20th anniversary of his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Conservative lawyers and pundits marked the occasion by publishing laudatory articles that had, to me, a distinctly valedictory feel to them. That includes at least one former clerk who may well be in contact with the justice and even have an inkling of his plans. On top of that, Alito gave this rare interview to Politico, which surprised me given that it was Politico that published the leak of his Dobbs draft opinion. So you’d think he might have a grudge. Anyway, in that interview, he seemed to look back over his service and view Dobbs as his finest achievement, almost like the capstone of his tenure. He also hinted that he was not really enjoying the job or the coarse civic culture of our current moment.

Finally, there’s another book coming out, this one by Mollie Hemingway, a MAGA pseudo-journalist, called Alito: The Justice Who Reshaped the Supreme Court and Restored the Constitution. It’s going to be this obsequious, bootlicking celebration of Alito’s brilliance. The publisher’s description calls it “the authoritative—and explosive—inside story of Justice Samuel Alito and his powerful role in shaping the Supreme Court.” It seems highly probable that Alito gave interviews to Hemingway, even if it was on background. It feels to me as if he is trying to secure his legacy within the conservative legal movement and the conservative media, which is what matters most to him. And I think that the main reason he would be doing that is because he’s ready to step down and pass the torch.

I was struck by the fact that in the Politico interview, Alito said he wished Justice Antonin Scalia were around to take a victory lap, because the court has achieved so much of what he worked toward and is now finally on the right track. It’s so sad he’s missing it. Within a paragraph, Alito then suggested that Scalia would have been “appalled” by the ugliness, the coarseness of the discourse. Well, who was single-handedly responsible for coarsening the discourse at the Supreme Court for a very long time? Why, it was Scalia! He’d be loving the discourse right now. He built it.

I also think this love story about originalism from Alito feels a little cynical. You and I have spent a lot of time discussing whether Alito really is an originalist or if whether is perfectly result-oriented and completely political. Either way, I guess the better question isn’t what Alito calls himself but what he does. If he does step down soon, won’t it probably be because he wants Trump to replace him while Republicans hold the Senate?

Alito is not an originalist. In fact, he’s made fun of originalism before. His jurisprudence is completely aligned with the Republican Party platform. He watches Fox News. I’m sure he reads the polls. He must know there is a real chance that Republicans could lose the Senate in the fall—which, of course, means that he would be stuck on the bench for at least two more years, maybe six more years, maybe even longer.

And we know that his wife, Martha-Ann, has been counting the minutes until Alito can retire so she can fly whatever flag she wants to.

Martha-Ann definitely wants him to step down. And Alito saw how Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a bad bet and wound up getting replaced by a successor who is torching her legacy. He doesn’t want that to happen. He is savvy enough to know that stepping down before the midterms means that Trump can replace him with someone who is just as conservative, if not more so. Republicans have a comfortable margin in the Senate. Retiring now could cement his jurisprudence for years to come with a mini-Alito who is 30 years younger. That’s probably what is guiding his decision more so than anything else. But in fairness, when we give justices life tenure, we empower them to make these kinds of partisan decisions. You can hate the game, but you can’t really hate the player.

Who do you think could potentially inherit the mantle of the man who gave us witchburners as the reason to overturn Roe v. Wade?

I will throw out two names: Emil Bove, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, and Andy Oldham, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. I flag Bove because he has already proved his absolute fealty to Trump—first as his personal lawyer, then at the Justice Department, when he struck the corrupt bargain to drop criminal charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, defied court orders barring the illegal deportation of Venezuelan migrants, and reportedly helped kill the investigation into Tom Homan’s alleged acceptance of a bribe. We know that Trump was disappointed in his first three picks because he felt as if they weren’t sufficiently loyal to him. With Bove, he wouldn’t have to worry about that.

At the same time, I can imagine that the White House might not want to reopen Bove’s scandals or give Democrats an opportunity to probe them. He’s already gotten his reward with a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit. So, to my mind, Oldham is the more likely candidate. He’s a former Alito clerk and a MAGA fanatic who has gone very far out of his way to campaign for this seat with a constant stream of Trump-pandering opinions. He’s even further right than Alito, who has overruled him multiple times. He also looks the part, which may seem like a shallow observation, but we know that that is important to this president. I think he has a leg up on his colleague James Ho, who has also been campaigning for the seat, because Ho will not look the part to this president. If I had to put money down, I’d say Oldham will be the pick, because he’s got the far-right jurisprudence and he looks like the MAGA justice from central casting in Donald Trump’s dreams.

I think you’re aiming way too high in selecting actual sitting judges for this. I’m going to go with Lindsey Halligan and Jeanine Pirro. I know central casting is the most important phrase for Trump when selecting someone. But I also think the “Own the Libs” vibe is such that it could be Kash Patel. You seemed to suggest that gravitas at some level is important. And I’m not sure it’s going to be.

There was a moment, when the tech CEOs and media moguls were lining up to kiss Trump’s ring, when it looked like almost all the demographic arrows were pointing right, where it looked like Trumpism was, if not widely embraced, at least too big to be written off. After a year of Trump back in office, the culture cries out for Woke 2.0.

It has been a year since J.D. Vance went to Europe and chose (rhetorical) violence.

At the Munich Security Conference last February, the vice president described Europe’s greatest threat as one “from within,” chiding its leadership for suppressing national speech and political participation, especially of anti-immigrant, anti-EU movements. Vance’s hostility, combined with some hypocrisy, shocked leaders: They’d expected a lecture from the incoming administration, but maybe on defense spending. Instead, Vance’s position suggested a more profound rupture in the trans-Atlantic relationship, one where the U.S.’s commercial tech interests and ideological affinity for Europe’s far right were coalescing into a broader attack on European sovereignty.

In the year since, the rift has widened, as the Trump administration and its allies have found common cause with Europe’s far right. In early February, the House GOP Judiciary Committee accused Europe of a “decade-long” campaign to censor the global internet, including by using its regulatory power to “silence political opposition.” European far-right leaders and political parties seized on these claims. “So maybe without interference of the EU we could have won the elections in 2025,” Geert Wilders, the leader of Party of Freedom, a Dutch far-right party, wrote on X.

It’s part of a broader effort between the MAGA movement, including Donald Trump and his allies, and the European populist right to frame the European Union as stifling free speech, particularly on U.S. tech platforms. Prominent voices in American Big Tech, most notably Elon Musk, have long opposed Europe’s attempts at moderating these platforms, and that has converged with the Trump administration’s deepening antagonism toward the European Union.

Now, American and European leaders are back in Munich starting Friday, with even more baggage between them: defense, Ukraine, tariffs, Trump’s designs on Greenland. All, or just one, could be fatal for a nearly 80-year partnership. But the U.S.’s push against what it perceives as censorship points to a more foundational break, one where the U.S. is more openly hostile to the European project and is actively seeking to destabilize European governance.

“In the past, people talked about how the liberal democratic shared value base was a glue for the trans-Atlantic relationship, even at times when perhaps strategic interests were diverging,” said Leonard A. Schütte, an international security program fellow at the Harvard Belfer Center. “Now we have divergent strategic interests and a diverging ideological value base. I’m extremely worried about the future of the trans-Atlantic relationship given those two fundamental forces.”

There are two components to these diverging ideological values. The first is a U.S. and European divide on how to manage tech and social platforms, including content moderation, data transparency, and privacy rules. This kind of policy split is not unusual, and past U.S. administrations—including Obama and Trump I—sometimes pushed back against Europe’s efforts to rein in American tech companies. But this Trump administration has framed such regulations as illiberal suppression of political speech and populist opposition movements. That has turned a divergence on how the European Union does tech policy into a more sweeping indictment of how Europe does democracy.

The particular boogeyman of the moment is the Digital Services Act, which fully went into effect in 2024, and broadly regulates large internet platforms—like Musk’s X or Meta’s Facebook—by asking those giants to remove content that would be illegal under EU or national laws, while also putting in procedures for users to challenge decisions. It pushes for greater accountability on things like advertising practices. Musk has declared all-out war on the DSA, in part because X came under the law’s scrutiny pretty quickly. In December, X was fined 120 million euros for violations after an investigation around the lack of transparency around who now had blue check-mark accounts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the fine on Musk’s X “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.”

Andrew Peek, the director of the Adrienne Arsht National Security Resilience Initiative of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center, and former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council under Trump, said that many in the administration and close to it are scarred from the COVID-19 pandemic and the politics around it, which they saw as a time of government overreach that shut down dissenting views on social media. “This really resonates very deeply, this systemic concern with political freedom and how easily it’s snuffed out,” Peek said. “I don’t want to sound hyperbolic—because it does sound hyperbolic—but I think this is legitimate. This is the way people feel.”

For a U.S. looking at Europe, Peek added, “it is perceived by us as an external interference in national elections and national politics, usually to the detriment of what the Trump administration would see as ideologically simpatico groups.”

Across Europe, freedom-of-speech laws are less absolutist than in the U.S., including a stricter approach to hate speech, born out of its history from World War II. But MAGA and those simpatico groups in Europe claim that is making them a target for their legitimate views, particularly on migration. “The European right-wing parties have tried to frame this, and the U.S. fight against increased platform regulation in Europe, as a fight against their positions—as a fight against their political combat to gain power,” said Jacob Ross, research fellow at the European Center at the German Council on Foreign Relations.

Ross said the MAGA movements, including parts of the administration, and certain European right-wing movements (like Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland) or those in power (like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán) see themselves aligned in wanting to change the trans-Atlantic and the Western status quo. “That’s an ideological common ground that exists and that certain elements of the U.S. government try to exploit,” he said, though he added it can get a bit awkward when the U.S. does things—like threaten to invade Greenland—that put these nationalistic parties in a tough spot. “That forced many European right-wing populists to distance themselves, to underline that they have their country’s interests in mind, European interests in mind,” Ross said, “while at the same time still hoping for some kind of support, certainly through the networks, and maybe money-wise as well, from these U.S. forces.”

Riccardo Alcaro, research coordinator and head of the global actors program at the Istituto Affari Internazionali, said that wing of MAGA—most closely associated with Vance and tech bros, like Musk, and Vance ally Peter Thiel—see Europe as an “object of almost resentful nostalgia,” because they believe it is betraying its cultural, religious (meaning Christian), and ethnic roots. Or as the White House’s National Security Strategy put it: “We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation.”

Linking regulation and civilization makes this existential for MAGA and its right-wing allies in Europe. That will likely make it harder for the U.S. to work constructively with Europe on legitimate concerns about, say, the regulatory burdens or even on censorship of political speech. Critics, for example, have raised concerns about its approach to disinformation during emergencies. But the United States is deploying a blunt, all-or-nothing approach. It sanctioned a former EU official that the State Department called the “mastermind” behind the DSA. The Financial Times reported that the State Department will fund MAGA-aligned think tanks, including to help undermine the DSA. Bram Vranken, a researcher and campaigner at the Corporate Europe Observatory, noted that Big Tech, including Meta and Google, have increased their lobbying of far-right groups in the European parliament. “They’re building a bridge between the Trump administration and the European far right,” he added.

This leaves the European Union and many of its leaders in another impossible bind, not unlike the one it’s facing on its defense amid the Trump administration’s flagging commitment to NATO and the president’s desire to coerce an ally to hand over its territory. When it comes to tech, as with defense, Europe is deeply, deeply reliant on American services. The European Digital SME Alliance, a trade group, said almost 80 percent of Europe’s digital tech is imported. What is more, America’s increasing hostility is raising concerns that if the U.S. took aggressive action—over Greenland, say—it could potentially wield that tech dependency as leverage, cutting off access and crippling European critical infrastructure.

“What [the Trump] administration has done is that they have really created a kind of Sputnik moment, where the Europeans realize now that this decoupling, or de-risking, from American technology is inevitable,” said Anu Bradford, a leading scholar on EU regulation at Columbia Law School.

But this realization comes with another: Right now, Europe has few alternatives. France announced that a French videoconferencing platform will replace American services for its government departments, but with the target date of 2027, according to ABC News. Aura Salla, member of the European Parliament from Finland in the European People’s Party, said there is a growing acceptance that Europe needs technological sovereignty. But, she added, “it will take time.”

Europe has been a very, very good market for American tech, which underscores the risk of the Trump administration’s blunt use of leverage with its European partners. Yet Europe isn’t a market Big Tech will quietly walk away from, either. Evelyn Austin, the executive director of Bits of Freedom, an Amsterdam-based digital rights organization, put it this way: “Reliance brings problems—and getting out of that reliance brings risks.”

Austin said she thinks Europe should identify this reliance as a national security threat, which might empower countries to accelerate that decoupling.

“What I find really daunting is the consequences or implications of that,” Austin said. “You’re walking into a very, very conflictual relationship with the U.S.—and that terrifies me. But I’m not sure if there’s any way around it. Aren’t we actually already there?”

            <div id="article-text">Hands-on Run real Windows in an automatically managed virtual machine, and mix Windows apps in their own windows on your Linux desktop.

WinApps and WinBoat both deliver the same functionality: they run real Windows in a VM and export native Windows apps in individual windows onto your Linux desktops, integrated with your native Linux applications, via the wizardry of Microsoft&#39;s Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP was Microsoft&#39;s answer to X11, before the great minds of the Wayland project came along to tell us that we don&#39;t need such things.

For all the abilities of modern Linux, there are some apps – especially paid commercial ones – that still require Windows. We outlined three ways to run Windows apps on Linux in May 2025. WINE is amazing and the current version can run a lot of Windows apps smoothly on Linux – but there are limits to its compatibility: for instance, there&#39;s no Microsoft Store. The main alternative is to run a real copy of Windows inside a virtual machine, and when you need those specific tools, fire up the VM, and use the apps inside it. (Since late 1994, the desktop version of VMWare is free to use – and it both offers pretty good performance for Windows guests, and some helpful integration tools.) Even so, managing a VM does require some effort, and moving your files and data between host and VM inevitably means some extra legwork.

Both WinApps and WinBoat aspire to make this seamless and almost invisible, using a real copy of Windows running in a hidden virtual machine that uses Linux&#39;s built-in native virtualization tools rather than add-on hypervisors. The goal is to offer better compatibility than WINE, near-native performance, and better integration between host OS and virtualized apps. The key differences are control and maturity. WinApps is quite mature and very flexible, but it needs you to either have some virtualization skills or to invest effort in learning and editing config files. WinBoat is new, hasn&#39;t reached version 1.0 yet, but it automates as much as possible away to make life easy.

WinApps is by some years the more mature of the two. Its creator Ben Curtis started the original project in about 2020, but development went dormant a couple of years ago, leading to a &quot;hard fork&quot; that is actively working on a modernized version.

WinApps was not the only project to investigate the same approach: running real Windows in a VM, and displaying apps over RDP. The Cassowary project did the same thing, but it too went quiet about four years ago.

WinApps is very flexible, and boasts compendious documentation. It supports three different ways to run Windows: two flavors of container, or directly using the kernel&#39;s KVM virtualization. If you&#39;re comfy with using container tools, then that&#39;s the easier way, and WinApps supports using either Docker or Podman. The main difference is that Docker requires root privileges, but Podman doesn&#39;t. Alternatively, WinApps can directly control a Windows instance inside KVM using the libvirt API, but the docs do warn:

While this method requires considerably more manual configuration, it also provides greater virtual machine customization options.

They are not kidding. The libvirt method is much more complex to install, but it&#39;s also much more flexible – for instance, this way, the hypervisor can even run on a different computer. For example, if you have a well-specced laptop with a broken screen sitting around doing nothing, you could dedicate a whole PC to the Windows VM, separately from your desktop box.

We tried an initial test run using Docker containers, but even though we predicted the rise of containers 15 years ago, this vulture has little experience of deploying the things. Without custom config, the WinApps config for both Docker and Podman defaults to storing the Windows VM in /var/lib – much as we noted of the Debian FreedomBox blend earlier this year. That means you need a big Linux root partition: the docs suggest a minimum size of 32 GB for the Windows system disk, and 64 GB is more prudent. The entire root volume on our testbed machine is only 64 gig, so we didn&#39;t have room for this approach.

The Reg FOSS desk is more familiar with KVM and its GUI front end, Virtual Machine Manager. As we&#39;ve used it before – ironically, mostly for running experimental Kubernetes clusters – we decided to try that instead. The WinApps documentation is very good, too. We used virt-manager to set up a 64 GB VM with 8 GB of RAM and two CPU cores, running Windows 10 IoT LTSC.

We followed the steps to set up host/VM integration. We recommend following this carefully and closely – at several points, it is not enough to just accept the default settings. We had to download and edit scripts in places, entering the correct local IP address so the scripts could find the VM and so on. You&#39;ll also need to know your way around Windows: you need to configure it, activate it, and so on. Helpfully, the docs tell you how to bypass Windows 11&#39;s burning need to talk to the mothership, so you can configure an offline account. At least that&#39;s less of an issue with Win10 LTSC.

Normally, you leave the Windows VM hidden and not logged in (which itself saves some memory in the VM, of course). When you open a Windows program, WinApps starts the VM if necessary, connects to it using the Linux FreeRDP client, and the app opens in its own window on your Linux desktop.

Setup is a long and complex process, though. It took us more than a day to get everything working. The final stage of setup integrates the apps in your new Windows VM into the Linux desktop&#39;s app launcher, which left us with several superfluous icons for things like Microsoft Paint. Doing it at this point feels premature to us – it means that any apps you install in your new VM don&#39;t get picked up.

Some of the steps require you to log out and log back in again to take effect. For an easy life, we treated it like many Windows installations: just reboot.

Next, on a different machine, we tried the much newer WinBoat application. WinBoat is only about six months old and is only up to version 0.9.0 so far, and it&#39;s implemented mostly in Typescript with a little bit of Go. It&#39;s attracting attention, though – The Register&#39;s own Rupert Goodwins mentioned it just last month.

The project FAQ section covers many of the differences. The first question is How does it compare to WinApps? To which it says:

With WinApps you do the bulk of the setup manually, and there&#39;s no cohesive interface to bring it all together. There&#39;s a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.

WinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. There&#39;s no need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.

To be honest, when we first read this last year, our response was dismissive – but after getting WinApps working, suddenly this seems like a good and desirable objective.

The WinBoat configuration tab has 13 or so options you can adjust, which is a lot easier than editing config files - click to enlarge

WinBoat offers few choices. It uses Docker (although v0.9.0 offers Podman as an option, with the drawback that USB passthrough no longer works). It doesn&#39;t ask you to configure Docker, either: all you need is to install it, for which it points to Docker&#39;s own instructions. You also need to install FreeRDP. The installation program links to FreeRDP&#39;s own docs again, although we just installed the standard X11 version in Ubuntu Noble&#39;s repositories and it worked fine.

WinBoat is available in various formats, including AppImage, native .deb and .rpm packages, and even a Nix version. For now, though, there&#39;s no repository, updates are your own lookout – so we chose the AppImage. On Ubuntu 24.04.4, this threw the same error message as our preferred Panwriter app, so we just recalled this command from our history:

The Appimage doesn&#39;t include any external dependencies – it just halts and warns you if they&#39;re missing. We installed Docker, rebooted, and tried again… then installed FreeRDP3 and rebooted… and it ran straight through. It can download a Windows evaluation .iso file for you, but we pointed at our local LTSC edition and it used it happily. It shows a link to open the Windows VM&#39;s screen in a browser tab, which you might need to activate and update Windows – but almost everything else is done for you. Let it chug away for half an hour to an hour.

The WinBoat apps screen lists all the programs it can identify in your VM: simple, but effective - click to enlarge

WinBoat also avoids fancy integration with the Linux desktop: the main app window shows the status of the Windows VM with large friendly buttons to pause and stop it, and a list of apps it found inside the VM. Click an app, wait a few seconds, and there it is, running in a window on your Linux desktop.

There is no simple answer to which is the better tool. WinBoat is much easier to get working, and it does the same job with little mess or fuss.

Like many power-user Linux programs, WinApps isn&#39;t too intimidating if you&#39;re happy to edit config files – especially if you&#39;re comfortable and familiar with Docker or Podman. Saying that, using it with KVM/VMM definitely has advantages. For instance, it allows you to tweak KVM memory ballooning. This feature enables the hypervisor to reclaim unused RAM from the VM so the host can use it. Our WinApps testbed machine has 24 GB of RAM, and we gave the VM 4 GB but allowed it to balloon up to 8 GB.

Another benefit is that virt-manager can connect to a remote machine and manage its VMs as easily as local ones, which means you could, for instance, take an old box that doesn&#39;t have a TPM 2 chip for Windows 11, configure a minimal text-only Linux setup on it. Then using VMM on your desktop, create a Windows guest instance with a fake virtual TPM, install Windows 11 in that, and allocate all but a gig or so of the machine&#39;s RAM to that VM. You could also pass a real physical GPU through to the VM.

If you have a very high-end PC and a big Linux root partition, you might not care about this. On the other hand, WinBoat offers a simple dialog box that asks where to save the container with the Windows VM inside – so we were able to put it in our home directory, on a separate disk partition, with no problem.

At the end of the day, they both work and do the job. Although setup is lower-tech, WinApps has better integration, on both the Windows side and the host desktop. For instance, WinApps offers a little status-bar applet, which lets you start and stop the VM, pick apps from a list, and open a desktop session. In both, you can connect a Windows network drive to your Linux home directory, making file exhange easy. In WinApps, it&#39;s \\tsclient\home, and in WinBoat it&#39;s \\host\lan. Either way, map a network drive and it&#39;s right there in a couple of clicks.

If you&#39;re an experienced Linux techie, WinApps can do fancy stuff. This vulture is pretty experienced, and even so, its setup process had us swearing at several points. On the other hand, WinBoat makes almost all that just go away. To quote the late great John Brunner:

It&#39;s supposed to be automatic but actually you have to press this button.

That button conceals a lot of black magic, but it hides the plumbing very well and it works.

Perhaps the best comparison is with the Windows Subsystem for Linux. WSL2 runs a Linux VM under Windows, integrated with the host OS; WinApps and WinBoat run a Windows VM under Linux, integrated with the host OS. If you are content and productive on your Linux desktop, but you constantly need certain specific Windows desktop apps and they don&#39;t work fully under WINE, this is easier and better-integrated than firing up a Windows VM in a window. Both tools can run Windows software that still doesn&#39;t work fully under WINE, such as current Microsoft and Adobe suites.

The downside, though, is that you are still running a full extra OS. You&#39;ll need to license it, it needs antivirus, and like any other copy of Windows it will need regular maintenance. Also, your computer&#39;s resources must be shared between both OSes. If you use this all day every day, you&#39;ll want lots of RAM, lots of fast disk space, and a fast machine. We tried two of our testbeds: an elderly (if well-specced) Thinkpad W520 with Ubuntu Questing, and a rather faster Dell Latitude 5420 with Ubuntu Noble. Windows apps were slow to launch on the Thinkpad; the whole process felt much smoother on the newer machine, but it still wasn&#39;t super-quick. On both, we saw display glitches when using two screens.

If your apps work, WINE is faster: apps launch quicker, integrate better, and because no copy of Windows is involved, there&#39;s no ongoing maintenance – and no license. The WinApps approach is strictly for desktop apps, and ideally, ones which don&#39;t want a fancy GPU or other dedicated local hardware. WINE and supplementary tools like Proton are better if what you want to run are Windows games. Most full-screen games won&#39;t work well in a VM.

WinApps and WinBoat beat WINE on compatibility, though. If you need the Windows Store, or current Microsoft or Adobe programs, this is a great way to run them on your Linux desktop. And of course, both WinApps and WinBoat are free and open source. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/14/ai_risk_distillation_attacks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two of the world&#39;s biggest AI companies, Google and OpenAI, both warned this week that competitors including China&#39;s DeepSeek are probing their models to steal the underlying reasoning, and then copy these capabilities in their own AI systems.

&quot;This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe,&quot; Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register, adding that the perpetrators are &quot;private-sector companies.&quot; He declined to name specific companies or countries involved in this type of intellectual property theft.

&quot;Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there&#39;s very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive,&quot; Hultquist said. &quot;This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless.&quot;

Google calls this process of using prompts to clone its models &quot;distillation attacks,&quot; and in a Thursday report said one campaign used more than 100,000 prompts to &quot;try to replicate Gemini&#39;s reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.&quot;

American tech giants have spent billions of dollars training and developing their own LLMs. Abusing legitimate access to mature models like Gemini, and then using this information to train newer models, makes it significantly cheaper and easier for competitors to develop their own AI chatbots and systems.

Google says it detected this probe in real time and protected its internal reasoning traces. However, distillation appears to be yet another AI risk that is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to eliminate.

This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless

Distillation from Gemini models without permission violates Google&#39;s terms of service, and Google can block accounts that do this, or even take users to court. While the company says it continues to develop better ways to detect and stop these attempts, the very nature of LLMs makes them susceptible.

Public-facing AI models are widely accessible, and enforcement against abusive accounts can turn into a game of whack-a-mole.

Plus, as Hultquist warned, as other companies develop their own models and train them on internal, sensitive data, the risk from distillation attacks is going to spread.

&quot;We&#39;re on the frontier when it comes to this, but as more organizations have models that they provide access to, it&#39;s inevitable,&quot; he said. &quot;As this technology is adopted and developed by businesses like financial institutions, their intellectual property could also be targeted in this way.&quot;

Meanwhile, OpenAI, in a Thursday memo [PDF] to the House Select Committee on China, blamed DeepSeek and other Chinese LLM providers and universities for copying ChatGPT and other US firms&#39; frontier models. It also noted some occasional activity from Russia, and warned illicit model distillation poses a risk to &quot;American-led, democratic AI.&quot;

China&#39;s distillation methods over the last year have become more sophisticated, moving beyond chain-of-thought (CoT) extraction to multi-stage operations. These include synthetic-data generation, large-scale data cleaning, and other stealthy methods. As OpenAI wrote:

Specifically, our review indicates that DeepSeek has continued to pursue activities consistent with adversarial distillation targeting OpenAI and other US frontier labs. We have observed accounts associated with DeepSeek employees developing methods to circumvent OpenAI&#39;s access restrictions and access models through obfuscated third-party routers and other ways that mask their source. We also know that DeepSeek employees developed code to access US AI models and obtain outputs for distillation in programmatic ways. We believe that DeepSeek also uses third-party routers to access frontier models from other US labs.

OpenAI also notes that it has invested in stronger detections to prevent unauthorized distillation. It bans accounts that violate its terms of service and proactively removes users who appear to be attempting to distill its models. Still, the company admits that it alone can&#39;t solve the model distillation problem.

It&#39;s going to take an &quot;ecosystem security&quot; approach to protect against distillation, and this will require some US government assistance, OpenAI says. &quot;It is not enough for any one lab to harden its protection because adversaries will simply default to the least protected provider,&quot; according to the memo.

The AI company also suggests that US government policy &quot;may be helpful&quot; when it comes to sharing information and intelligence, and working with the industry to develop best practices on distillation defenses. OpenAI also called on Congress to close API router loopholes that allow DeepSeek and other competitors to access US models, and to restrict &quot;adversary&quot; access to US compute and cloud infrastructure. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">APRICOT 2026 For almost 30 years, the PingER project at the USA’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory used ping thousands of time each day to measure the time a packet of data required to make a round trip between two nodes on the internet.

But in 2024, the last person working on the project retired and SLAC shut it down without a plan to preserve or share the data it collected.

Happily, the tight network research community knew of PingER’s demise. Enter Jim Cowie, a computer scientist, academic, and entrepreneur.

In the latter capacity, Cowie founded a company called Renesys that between 2000 and 2014 gathered and sold intelligence about internet infrastructure – think of it as a precursor to Cloudflare’s Radar service.

A company called Dyn acquired Renesys in 2014, before itself being acquired by Oracle. During the back-office crunch that followed the two acquisitions, much of the data Renesys had collected over the years was lost.

“As time passes, information likes to disappear. If you do not invest, its default is to die,” Cowie told The Register.

Losing data irks Cowie, who, this week, told the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Conference on Operational Technologies (APRICOT) he thinks “the operational exhaust of the internet” can help humanity to understand what networked systems have done to society.

“If we wanted to understand if human progress and technical progress are aligned, how would we do that?” he asked during his keynote address. “These are perilous times. Everything is changing and we don’t know how.”

Cowie thinks historians can start to answer those questions by investigating data collected by projects like PingER, Renesys, and others who collect data about the internet’s operations.

So he’s started a project to preserve those files for posterity.

It’s called the Internet History Initiative (IHI) and Cowie says its mission is to identify and preserve the records that will let future generations tell the story of the internet and its impact. He thinks it will need to involve archivists, library scientists, technologists, and other specialists, operating across many institutions.

A core activity of the project will be to apply the LOCKSS principle – Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe – to store data offline using methods that will preserve it for a century. Cowie thinks IHI will need a distributed group of project participants who store parts of the collection, plus a federation layer that provides a view of all the datasets it stores. He also envisages another version of the collection in warm storage so researchers can access it.

He’s optimistic IHI will be able to create such a resource, because similar collections already exist.

“People like the RIPE NCC have been holding on to routing data and active performance data for decades and have organized it,” Cowie said.

He also pointed to the University of Oregon’s RouteViews project, which has archived almost 30 years of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing data and makes it available to researchers.

That project’s peering coordinator, Nina Bargisen, said RouteViews is already aware of the IHI, feels its goals are similar to its own, and sees no reason why her organization would not be willing to engage and help.

“There are probably a half a dozen or a dozen organizations like that, which have that kind of history,” Cowie said, and if they pool expertise the IHI will have plenty to work with. “We are not starting from zero, by any means.”

Indeed, IHI has already preserved some datasets from RIPE, and recovered the SLAC PingER data.

The organization has also identified the data it wants to preserve, and some data it fears may already be lost.

Cowie told The Register he is aware of an academic paper that describes a research project that analyzed every packet of data transmitted from the USA to the UK for two hours. The paper remains easy to find, he said, but the data it describes has vanished.

He hopes someone knows where that data, and other collections like it, can be found. “Think of people you know who have old traceroutes, or zone files, on a magnetic tape or in their closet,&quot; he said, and then ask them to contact the project.&quot;

He’s open to learning about new data sources, too. The Register pointed out that networking vendors have collected decades of data describing customers’ use of their products, and that Cisco has so much that it&#39;s trained custom LLMs. Cowie seemed intrigued by the possibilities such data creates for IHI.

The IHI will need friends, and funding. RouteViews’ Bargisen said if anyone can pull this off, Cowie can. The man himself said he’s in discussions with various parties, but that it is too early to discuss how the project will constitute itself.

But he urged anyone interested to join its mailing list and stay tuned. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon inched closer to its atomic datacenter dream on Friday after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed its small modular reactor partner X-energy to make nuclear fuel for advanced reactors at a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

The approval clears yet another hurdle to the commercial rollout of these miniaturized reactors by major bit barn operators. Amazon became one of the first to embrace the yet unproven tech in late 2024 when it made a $500 million bet on X-Energy&#39;s Xe-100 reactors to end its reliance on the power grid and fuel its datacenter growth.

X-Energy&#39;s license under 10 CFR part 70 enables its subsidiary TRISO-X to manufacture the high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel pellets that will eventually power that reactor.

The company boasts its TX-1 and TX-2 fuel plants are the first such facilities to receive approval in half a century, though we&#39;ll note they&#39;re not exactly finished. X-Energy expects to complete construction of the first site later this year, and it can&#39;t start churning out pellets until it passes an on-site inspection by the NRC to ensure it&#39;s safe.

For safety&#39;s sake, the enriched uranium is formed into small TRISO fuel particles coated in multiple layers of carbon and ceramic materials, which are then embedded in graphite to form pebbles roughly the size of a billiard ball. Hundreds of thousands of these pebbles will be circulated through the reactor continuously. In the case of the Xe-100, heat generated by this process will be captured using helium gas and then used to produce steam to drive a turbine.

Each Xe-100 reactor is expected to produce up to 80 megawatts of power continuously for 60 years. For context, that&#39;s enough to power the typical AWS campuses of yesteryear, although the honkin&#39; GPU-cranking datacenters of the putative AI boom are slated to use up to 50 times that much.

X-Energy expects to produce roughly 700,000 pebbles a year at its TX-1 site, enough for around 11 reactors. Its TX-2 site, which is currently in the design phase, is expected to dramatically increase production.

While a step toward energy independence, Amazon will be waiting a while longer to get its hands on the tech. X-Energy expects to deliver the five gigawatts of power contracted by Amazon &quot;by&quot; 2039, with the first reactors coming online sometime in the 2030s. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite its CEO&#39;s insistence that it wasn&#39;t doing any &quot;large scale&quot; deals soon, ServiceNow has acquired yet another company. This time, the software firm has scooped up Pyramid Analytics, an Israeli corporation with data science and preparation expertise. The goal is to build additional context and semantics into its software stack.

“Pyramid adds an analytics and semantic layer that can define metrics in a way that both humans and AI agents can rely on,” Forrester VP and Principal Analyst Charles Betz told The Register Friday. “Natural‑language querying is one expression of that, but the deeper value for customers is moving analytics closer to action — embedding trusted, shared meaning directly into workflows, suitable for agentic automation, rather than treating semantics as purely a design time problem and analytics as a downstream reporting use case.”

Grabbing Pyramid Analytics is the latest in a string of acquisitions that ServiceNow is using to build a software stack that goes from ingesting tickets and monitoring workflows to using knowledge graphs to understand the what and why behind objects that appear in a customers&#39; CMDBs. The company’s purchase of Data.World and Veza are other examples of this direction.

“The most important signal is less about natural‑language query per se and more about semantics,” Betz said.

ServiceNow said that when Pyramid Analytics’ capabilities are brought into the fold, customers will be able to turn its dashboards that display information into action within the system.

“For example, AI-driven insights can automatically surface an issue, open and route a case, recommend the next best actions, and drive resolution across IT and the business — all in one connected workflow,” wrote Guarav Rewari, general manager and senior vice president of data analytics in a blog that announced the deal.

Pyramid will provide “canonical” definitions for a business which will allow humans and AI agents to take more confident action on business decisions across the customer’s IT estate, Rewarit wrote. He said it lets ServiceNow break out of the domain-specific use cases and connect to data outside of ServiceNow’s traditional remit.

“We’ll use Pyramid Analytics to deliver high-value solutions across IT, HR, supply chain, and other areas, combining data connectivity, AI-powered queries, workflow automation, and trusted governance,” Rewari wrote.

News of the acquisition came about two weeks after company CEO Bill McDermott told investors the company had no more “large scale” M&A deals planned during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call.

“And as it relates to future M&A, we do not have a large-scale M&A on the road map,&quot; he said. “What happened, and I felt for you all, we had Moveworks. It took 9 months to close. We no sooner closed Moveworks … and then had Armis and Veza come to you within like a few days. So probably, it was a little bit what&#39;s going on over there at ServiceNow? And I noticed that we lost about $10 billion in market cap on that because of the worry. So now the worry is gone, you can give us back to market cap.”

Since that Jan. 28 call, ServiceNow’s share price has dropped an additional 8.27 percent.

Financial details of the Pyramid Analytics transaction were not disclosed. A ServiceNow spokesperson told The Register that this purchase was not material to financial results and described it as a “tuck-in.”

“Pyramid is a smaller, strategic tuck-in that strengthens our data and analytics capabilities,” the spokesperson said. “It is not material to our business.”

Betz said that, while the “optics are not the best,” when McDermott made those comments the deal was likely almost closed.

“I took Bill McDermott’s comments as aimed at very large, balance‑sheet‑shaping transactions,” Betz told The Register. “Pyramid appears materially smaller than deals like Armis, more targeted rather than a broad portfolio bet. In that sense, it’s consistent with a strategy of filling specific gaps rather than pursuing transformational M&A. Also, timing. Bill said that just a few weeks back; the Pyramid deal was presumably way too far done to reverse.” ®

            <div id="article-text">Can using AI teach you to code more quickly than traditional methods? Anthropic certainly thinks so. The AI outfit has partnered with computer science education org CodePath to get Claude and Claude Code into the hands of students, a time-tested strategy for seeding product interest and building brand loyalty.

The project aims to Claude-ify more than 20,000 students at community colleges, state schools, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

According to Anthropic, more than 40 percent of CodePath students come from families earning less than $50,000 a year, a nod to the less privileged who may not be able to afford college without financial assistance.

&quot;We now have the technology to teach in two years what used to take four,&quot; said Michael Ellison, co-founder and CEO of CodePath, in a statement. &quot;But speed for some and not others just widens inequality. Partnering with Anthropic means our students learn to build with Claude from day one, at institutions that have historically been overlooked. This results in better outcomes for our students and a fundamentally different answer to who gets to shape the AI economy.&quot;

We question whether access to Claude will empower economically disadvantaged students to &quot;shape the AI economy.&quot; Entering the workforce with some knowledge of Claude should enable participation in the AI economy – certainly a win if the Claude-deprived find jobs scarce. But shaping the AI economy remains the privilege of corporations and billionaires, of those throwing cash at computing infrastructure, politicians, and public relations.

CodePath plans to integrate Claude into various programming courses to give students experience building projects with AI tools and contributing to open source projects – at least the ones that allow AI-generated code submissions.

CodePath students have been pilot testing Claude Code, to good effect, it&#39;s claimed. Anthropic reports that Laney Hood, CodePath student and computer science major at Texas Tech University, had nice things to say about its software.

&quot;Claude Code was instrumental in my learning process, especially since I came into the project with very little experience in the programming languages used in the repository [including TypeScript and Node.js],&quot; said Hood.

At the start of the personal computer revolution in the 1980s, companies like Apple and Microsoft worked to get their products into the hands of students, knowing that early familiarity encourages customer retention.

As web and cloud services began to overshadow traditional operating systems as computing gatekeepers, Google adopted a similar strategy by pushing its Chromebook hardware into schools. More recently, Meta has followed suit, with a mixed and virtual reality offering called Meta for Education.

And now, as AI companies strive to make their models chokepoints for computing services, they too are wooing students in the hope of building lasting brands.

OpenAI, last year, announced that it had joined the American Federation of Teachers to help launch the National Academy for AI Instruction, alongside Anthropic and Microsoft. And before that, OpenAI debuted ChatGPT Edu. Meta, meanwhile, has been trying to get its Llama model family into schools through a partnership with Blended Labs.

Anthropic insists that its tie-up with CodePath isn&#39;t just about modernizing the curriculum of computer science. The AI biz says it expects to work with CodePath on public research into the way that AI is changing education and economic opportunities.

Those opportunities – specifically programming jobs – have declined significantly since 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Nonetheless, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says, &quot;Overall employment of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers is projected to grow 15 percent from 2024 to 2034, much faster than the average [of 3 percent] for all occupations.&quot;

There is already ample research on the impact that AI is having on computer science education. Recent papers on the subject tend to be a mixed bag, finding AI assistance can be helpful if properly administered, so long as there&#39;s compensation for the learning lost by offloading cognitive tasks. ®

Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 116, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, happy National Ferris Wheel Day to all those who celebrate, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)

This week, I’ve been reading about Letterboxd and Mike Vrabel and AI influencers and daytime talk show economics, taking copious notes on Ezra Klein’s terrific podcast on the state of the internet, buying just about every lamp in this excellent office tour, making Dot my main Mac calendar app, telling everyone I know how good Steal is, re-reading Tim Wu’s excellent book The Master Switch ahead of some Version History recordings, and eating a frankly inappropriate amount of Siete tortilla chips.

I also have for you a fun new Switch game, a wild new movie to see this weekend, the best new earbuds on the market, a new AI model to watch, and much more.

Oh, and! Somewhat miraculously, we have a few copies of our incredible zine, Content Goblins, still available for sale. If you buy one, and use the code 30OFFZINEINSTAL at checkout, you’ll get 30 percent off. I don’t think there are many left, get yours while you can!

Las thing, quick programming note: Installer is off next week. Taking a break while we get some other stuff ready. But we got a big one this week to make up for it! Let’s go.

(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you watching / reading / playing / listening to / downloading onto a thumb drive this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)

Over the years, lots of people have tried to chart an online life without Big Tech companies. Reasons abound, from advertising ickiness to data privacy to the overall feeling that these companies don’t support your values, but my impression was always that the project is hard, and that getting away from Google and Apple and Microsoft and the rest is probably too much work for most people.

I’m not sure that’s true anymore. Whether you’re looking for an email service, an office suite, even a smartphone or a laptop, you have more and broader options than ever before. Which is good, because the number of people asking me for tips on how to embrace these new things has gone way up over the last few months. Again, reasons abound. So I asked you all to share your favorite non-Big Tech tech, and as always, you delivered.

Beyond that, there was a bunch of other software:

If I were starting this journey today, I think I’d start with Proton and Home Assistant. Getting your email, your calendar, and your files into a safer place, and turning your smart home into something only you control, is a nice way to kick off a different relationship with tech. But give me six months, and who knows? Maybe I’ll be self-hosting my entire computing life in my basement. Installer Web Services has a nice ring to it.

I am not the expert on ditching Big Tech in your life, though. You should instead listen to Paris Marx, who has been on this journey for many years. Paris is an author and podcaster and vocal tech critic whose work has opened my eyes in a number of ways to how things really work.

Last year, Paris wrote a great guide to dropping US tech services with a bunch of really useful recommendations for where to go instead. It made me curious how he’s actually doing this in his own life, so I asked him to share his current setup. Here’s his homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:

The phone: Just a regular iPhone 15, though I keep eyeing a refurbished 13 mini. Bring back small phones!

The wallpaper: I like seeing where I am on the globe, so it’s just a built-in Apple one. Not sure if it has a specific name.

The apps: Vivaldi, Inoreader, Apple Notes, Deezer, Bluesky, Proton Mail, Messages, Phone, Signal.

I’ve deleted a bunch of apps over the past few months and prefer to keep my homescreen pretty basic to try to reduce distraction. On top of some standard Apple apps, Signal, and Bluesky, I have Norwegian web browser Vivaldi, Bulgarian feed reader Inoreader, French streaming service Deezer, and Proton Mail from Switzerland. Notes should be gone soon too, in favor of Obsidian, which is based in Canada. (Some are on Downtime because the screenshot was taken after 7PM).

I also asked Paris to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:

Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.

“I’ve been rebuilding my personal music collection. I buy most of my albums from Bandcamp so I can download the FLAC version to load on my modified iPod Classic 7th gen. For things I can’t find there, if it’s on YouTube, I use a Python utility called yt-dlp which allows me to download single videos or entire playlists. The downloads are usually in WebM or MKV format, so I have to use FFMpeg to convert them to MP3s, followed by MusicBrainz Picard to apply the correct metadata. It’s somewhat of a chore, but honestly it’s a lot of fun!” — Nick

“Loving my new Anbernic RG34XXSP! It’s perfect for playing GBA games because of the clamshell design and 3:2 aspect ratio screen. MinUI (OS) also makes it a very focused experience. Currently playing through The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap for the first time.” — Parker

“Currently very into these two Bluesky accounts. They both bring me so much joy: I Photoshop Paddington into a movie, TV show, or pop culture until I forget, and Inserting a Muppet into a Star Trek screenshot.” — BaltMatrix

“I’ve been using my Maxell Japanese cassette player more and more. I found a shop in Roma Norte where it feels like a super cool hunting trip, digging for music I like on cassette. I also figured out how to connect it via Bluetooth to my Echos around the apartment, which makes listening to music a completely different experience.” — Josue

“Watching the new season of Jujutsu Kaisen and it’s a masterpiece so far! Every episode is an art piece. Same thing with Frieren.” — Kolin

“I’m in Michigan and this winter has been long and cold. Stardew Valley had been a remedy until I got to winter there as well. The relief I felt when it became spring last night was palpable. Now waiting for the real thing.” — Ian

“I’ve been totally into AI dictation tools like Wispr Flow, Willow, and Raycast. I’m so much faster speaking than typing. They work seamlessly on Mac but have some friction on iOS due to permissions. Makes me think this will be baked into future versions of Mac/iOS natively.” — Irfan

“NewsMap has been helping me get a bird’s eye view of current events. It’s a ‘squarified tree map visualization of Google News.’ Runs as a web app and is customizable. Quick, easy color coded news in a handy grid format.” — Seth

“I was sitting waiting to see The 25th Annual Putnam Spelling Bee in NYC, and a few rows in front of me a girl was scrolling what looked like a TikTok feed, but was filled with little mini-app toys that seemed impossibly varied and unending. A quick Google turned it up: a new app called Gizmo. This thing is super early but it’s one of those AI implementations that instantly sent my head spinning.” — Alex

Last week was the Super Bowl, which you probably already knew. The Super Bowl is definitely the Super Bowl of football, but it’s also the Super Bowl for cool videos about how football works. So in the span of a few days, we were treated to an inside look at how a stadium handles two huge events in a row, a deep look at the NFL’s obsession with growing its international audience, an hourlong podcast about the pregame flyover, a great vlog about life as a sports photographer, and so much more. Also, semi-related, a very cool video about the unbelievable speed of instant replay systems.

It was a crappy game this year, but boy was it good content. And at least the Patriots lost.

The company may have walked away from one controversial partner, but its Community Requests program still runs through a major DHS contractor: Axon.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

The most striking thing about Ring’s statement that it had parted ways with Flock Safety is what the home security company didn’t say. There was no mention of the public backlash around ties to ICE, or any promise to address users’ concerns about the company’s relationships with law enforcement.

In an increasingly authoritarian political climate, the threat of mass surveillance fueled by AI-powered cameras is what many people fear. Yet Ring’s statement made no attempt to address this. Instead, the company claims it canceled Flock’s integration with its Community Requests tool because it would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”

It’s clear to everyone that the Amazon-owned company caved to public pressure. Sentiment across social media and news outlets following the airing of Ring’s Search Party Super Bowl ad skewed almost 50 percent negative, according to research by Peakmetrics. People are not happy with the company, and the move was an obvious attempt to claw back some goodwill.

The backdown must have been particularly galling for founder and VP Jamie Siminoff, who has consistently maintained that Ring’s products are designed to help prevent and fight crime.

This is not a new approach for the company. While public opinion on law enforcement has shifted significantly since his departure from Ring in 2023 and his return last year, Siminoff still strongly believes that the combination of AI, cameras, and police can make neighborhoods safer.

While Ring has parted ways with Flock, its Community Requests tool hasn’t changed. It’s still very much active, thanks to a partnership with Axon, a similar law-enforcement technology company best known for making Tasers.

Community Requests was introduced by Siminoff upon his return, following his predecessor’s canning of Ring’s first controversial police-request tool. It allows authorized local law enforcement agencies to request video footage from residents near an active investigation without a warrant. That footage then goes through Axon’s evidence management system. Responding to a request is optional, and Ring maintains that your privacy is always protected and that footage is never sent automatically.

One of Axon’s former executives was the acting director of ICE

Ring is currently touting how the tool is being used in the investigation into Nancy Guthrie’s kidnapping, and the company says it was instrumental in tracking down the suspect in the Brown University shooting.

Canceling the Flock integration doesn’t change Community Requests; it just pauses the expansion. If Ring had gone through with it, the program could have reached the 5,000 local law enforcement agencies that work with Flock. Instead, it’s now limited to those that work with Axon, an integration that Ring says is continuing.

Ring maintains that no federal agencies, including ICE, can use Community Requests to ask for footage from Ring users. But critics say that in jurisdictions where local police act under a 287(g) agreement, ICE could gain access to their resources, including video footage.

This is exactly what Flock was criticized for. As reported by 404 Media, 287(g) agreements with local agencies gave ICE “side-door access” to Flock’s automated license plate reader system — a nationwide network of AI-powered surveillance cameras.

While Flock has run pilot programs with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which houses ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), it claims it has no DHS contracts. Axon has many.

Axon has turned Tasers into a billion-dollar business and now makes body and vehicle cameras and software platforms used by law enforcement agencies. According to public records, Axon has been awarded more than 70 contracts with the DHS for its equipment and software, totaling more than $96 million between 2003 and 2024.

One of Axon’s former executives, Ronald D. Vitiello, was the acting director of ICE and is now a senior advisor to CBP. Axon spent nearly $2.5 million on political lobbying last year.

If Ring ditched Flock because of its ICE ties, it would make sense to ditch Axon, too

Along with Axon Evidence, Axon also operates Fusus, a cloud-based platform it purchased in 2024 that can pull together real-time data from cameras, sensors, drones, and community feeds, “turning disparate assets into a shared intelligence network for faster, coordinated response.” On its website, Axon is actively marketing the software as a tool for CBP.

In 2023, Fusus was reportedly capable of integrating real-time data from private cameras, although it required additional hardware and a fee. The platform’s capabilities sound a lot like the foundations of a dystopian neighborhood surveillance system that Ring’s Super Bowl ad sparked fears of.

If Ring ditched Flock because of its ICE ties, it would make sense to ditch Axon, too. But that’s not the move the company is making.

Ring’s vast infrastructure is already in place, with millions of AI-powered cameras on porches and in homes across the country, and its tool that connects users’ footage with law enforcement relies on a company with direct ties to DHS.

If Ring wants to regain users’ trust, it can’t just vaguely point to a partnership canceled due to “resources.” It needs to acknowledge these concerns openly and clearly define how far it’s willing to take this powerful technology, and — more importantly — where it will draw the line.

It’s been eight years since I last reviewed a robot vacuum. Having spent the last two months with a new flagship, I’m shocked by how much they’ve advanced from early bump-and-run models.

In October, DJI launched its very first robovacs in Europe. I’ve been testing the top-of-the-line Romo P model, which doesn’t yet have a US release date. It includes a self-cleaning base station, a mopping function, and enough high-end specs and charm that my colleague Jen Tuohy took notice.

Jen is a true robovac expert. I, let’s be clear, am not. But I can share what it’s like to make the jump from an entry-level model to one of these multifunctional combo units, something I imagine many Verge readers have considered.

To say I’m impressed by the performance of the drone maker’s first and best robot vacuum is an understatement. But I’m also not convinced anyone should spend over $2,000 for the DJI Romo P, regardless of how much I like its transparent looks.

My colleague witnessed my robot getting hacked first hand

I’m especially troubled by a recently exploited security vulnerability that let anyone see inside owners’ homes. DJI says the vulnerability has been closed, and that seems to be true based upon our testing, but others remain. It’s an egregious oversight by a company already in the US government’s crosshairs because of security and data privacy concerns.

My colleague Sean Hollister, who witnessed my robot being accessed remotely by a third party (with my cooperation), has all the details in a separate story. I’ve scored the Romo with the assumption that the vulnerability has indeed been patched, but with a lingering concern that other issues might yet be exploited on this cloud-connected camera and microphone on wheels.

It’s not nice to live in a home with a robot you can’t trust.

Great for transparency nerdsKept floors spotless Excellent obstacle avoidance and navigationNearly autonomous cleaning

Lingering security concernVery expensiveFailed to clean semi-dried ketchupCan struggle with deep carpetsBig and noisy, like all base stations

I don’t really have space for a mini-fridge-sized appliance in my tiny Dutch home, especially one that sits there so conspicuously, like a monument erected to commemorate all the cleaning I used to do manually. My engineering heart, however, is quite fond of the transparent base station that’s “made to be displayed, not just stored” — but that sentiment is definitely not shared by the other members of my five-person household.

The base station is a massive upgrade over simple robovacs with charging docks. It not only charges the Romo, but it automatically empties the robot’s dust bin, drains and refills its water tank, cleans and dries its mopping pads, and even cleans the dock itself to keep odors and mold under control. It all happens with quite a bit of ruckus, however, and you still have to regularly add fresh water to the larger base station tank and empty the dirty water and debris it collects. But maintenance is much less frequent than a basic robovac, resulting in a nearly autonomous daily cleaner.

DJI’s robot vacuum relies upon the same sensors used in its flagship drones. Its dual fisheye vision sensors and wide-angle LiDARs mapped the room in less than five minutes. It successfully identified a large rug and knew not to mop it, unlike all the surrounding concrete in our open-plan kitchen and living room. However, when I swapped the rug for a new one and tried the mapping again, it failed to correctly identify it. So, with some difficulty, I had to manually edit the map. Subsequent edits to create custom cleaning routines by room were easier as I became more familiar with the DJI app.

DJI’s Romo cleans incredibly well, compared to the old Deebot N97 I reviewed, and it mops, too — what a luxury! It also performs better in corners and edges thanks to a brush and mop pad on the right side that both extend when needed. And when cleaning, either the spinning mop pads or roller brushes will lift to avoid cross-contamination.

Romo can vacuum first and then mop, or, if I’m in a hurry, perform both simultaneously without everything getting wet and gunky. It can also function as just a vacuum or just a mop. The app makes it fairly easy to create cleaning tasks that can be scheduled or executed immediately. I use a “quick vac” and “kitchen mop” when needed, and schedule a quick “daily cleaning” and more thorough “deep cleaning.” I like that I can clean a specific zone and finely tune suction power, water usage, and the number of passes. I’ve never experienced such granular control over a robovac, but this is now common for these high-end cleaners.

I tossed a quarter cup of oatmeal onto the polished concrete and the vac left five flakes in standard suction mode, one in max mode, and zero with high-power consumption “turbo” enabled. In general, I need to use max suction or make multiple passes to be sure my most heavily trafficked floor is left grit-free. We have a dog and spend a lot of time at the beach, so sand tends to get everywhere.

On my deep-pile rug, three oatmeal flakes remained even after three passes in max turbo mode. Not bad, but my upright vacuum performs a lot better. Romo probably would have done better if I swapped the rubber roller brush with the included bristle brush... but my dog mistook them for chew toys shortly after unboxing the vac. My wife and daughter both have long hair, and the Romo vac does a good job of sweeping it into the hollow center between the duo-divide brushes, just like Roborock’s less expensive Qrevo Curv series.

Romo has a special degrease mode which applies cleaning solution directly to the mop pads for splattered grease and cooking stains. It seems effective, as it stopped my dog — a very hungry beagle — from compulsively licking the floor in front of the stove. The base station can wash the robovac’s pads at around 60 degrees Celsius (140F) when it returns.

Even in degrease mode with maximum water usage selected, the vac failed to clean a line of semi-dried ketchup even after three passes — something I removed in a few seconds with a little elbow grease. Romo fared better with a small puddle of spilt milk, though it initially seemed tempted to navigate around it. That’s probably because Romo is designed to avoid pet waste.

I like that modern robots are methodical, none of that frustratingly random zigzagging I’m used to with bump-and-run bots. This speeds up cleaning and optimizes battery life. DJI makes a big deal out of its millimeter-level obstacle-sensing technology on the Romo. It works, in general, but it’s not foolproof.

Romo easily avoided socks, shoes with loosely tied shoelaces, dog toys, and poop-sized objects, but not smaller items like coins and buttons. Impressively, it routed around thin playing cards, as claimed, but only if they produced plenty of contrast with the floor — otherwise, it just ran over them. And when I tossed a small USB cable onto my concrete floor, Romo avoided it every time. But on my rug, it ran over that same cable again and again, but still managed to finish cleaning.

DJI’s robovac also marks things as obstacles that shouldn’t be, like a water-sealed power outlet that sits flush on my floor and the slightly lifted corner of my rug, measuring no more than 1cm above the ground. The even plusher rug in my bedroom has utterly defeated Romo’s traction, and the thin throw rug in my bathroom has to be removed before cleaning, or Romo will push it into a pile. Weirdly, it also seems blinded by a reflective aluminum dog bowl that it will shove across the floor instead of avoiding.

Importably, Romo confidently avoids falling down stairs, and even managed to surmount a 7.5cm (3 inch) floor gap for a sliding pocket door — a place the Deebot would get stuck in.

DJI’s Romo is noisy, but it’s pretty quiet for a robovac. When operation begins, the base station produces a sudden 63dB burst of dust-collecting noise, enough to jolt my dog into fight or flight mode. And since Romo doubles as a mop, it has to jet-wash and dry those pads once it returns to the base station, which also gets a scrub. When drying the pads — a process that takes several hours — I measured a constant 35dB from the base station at a distance of 1 meter. That’s not so much loud as tiring. I always feel a sense of relief when the drying cycle ends, so it’s best done at night if you can.

The robovac produces a relatively quiet 53dB (measured from 1 meter) when cleaning at standard intensity, or up to 63dB at max, my preferred setting. That’s not bad, but still louder than the 55dB produced by the Matic robot.

At first, I liked that I could remotely monitor everything, watching progress on a map updated in real time and even seeing obstacles captured by the vac’s camera. Talking to my bewildered dog through Romo’s camera and mic kept me endlessly entertained, but knowing that others could have watched my kids freaked me right the fuck out! The remote video function is protected by a pin, and the bot makes an announcement that “remote video is starting,” but none of that prevented streams from being spied on.

The privacy and security risks of inviting a robot fitted with cloud-connected cameras, a microphone, and vision sensors into your home is a personal choice. Yes, the US government sees DJI as a threat, but lots of people see the US government as a threat. Nevertheless, I disabled remote video on the Romo and covered the camera with tape for the last few days of testing.

With over 50 test runs and 820 square-meters cleaned, the transparent vac and base still look almost new, despite the dirty jobs they’re responsible for. Only twice did I find that a scarf or blanket had been sucked into the vacuum, causing it to stop cleaning. When this happened, I would get an alert on my phone with an image of the obstruction.

I’ve had to refill or empty the base station’s water tanks three times in 26 hours of operation, but the large 2.4L dustbag still isn’t full. Dumping the wastewater into the toilet stinks, but the base station itself remains odorless. The base station is self-cleaning, using high-pressure jets that wash away any debris collected. Nevertheless, DJI recommends inspecting it every 3 months.

I gotta say, I’ve loved having a robot that can reliably vacuum and mop my floors with a fraction of the intervention required by budget vacs. Romo is a very good inaugural effort, just like DJI’s first e-bike. I’m now sold on multipurpose base stations, but DJI’s pricing and lapsed security is a good reason to look elsewhere.

Paying €1,899 (about $2,250) for the top-of-the-line Romo P model buys you a very good, nearly autonomous DJI cleaning drone. But for that same money, you could employ a human housekeeper for one hour each week for about two years, and they’ll do more than mop and vacuum your floors. The €1,299 (about $1,500) Romo S might not include the transparent design and a few unnecessary cleaning perks, but it’s much better value for money.

Just know that there are plenty of decent $500 to $800 robot vacuums from companies like Roborock and Ecovacs that should clean about as well as the DJI Romo, with the best costing no more than $1,300. The Roborock Qrevo Curvx is very similar for just $899.

Otherwise, maybe all you really need is a $200-ish bump-and-run robot vacuum that requires more manual intervention but won’t subject your household to a rogue HAL on wheels.

The immediate threat may be fixed, but this raises serious questions.

Sammy Azdoufal claims he wasn’t trying to hack every robot vacuum in the world. He just wanted to remote control his brand-new DJI Romo vacuum with a PS5 gamepad, he tells The Verge, because it sounded fun.

But when his homegrown remote control app started talking to DJI’s servers, it wasn’t just one vacuum cleaner that replied. Roughly 7,000 of them, all around the world, began treating Azdoufal like their boss.

He could remotely control them, and look and listen through their live camera feeds, he tells me, saying he tested that out with a friend. He could watch them map out each room of a house, generating a complete 2D floor plan. He could use any robot’s IP address to find its rough location.

“I found my device was just one in an ocean of devices,” he says.

On Tuesday, when he showed me his level of access in a live demo, I couldn’t believe my eyes. Ten, hundreds, thousands of robots reporting for duty, each phoning home MQTT data packets every three seconds to say: their serial number, which rooms they’re cleaning, what they’ve seen, how far they’ve traveled, when they’re returning to the charger, and the obstacles they encountered along the way.

I watched each of these robots slowly pop into existence on a map of the world. Nine minutes after we began, Azdoufal’s laptop had already cataloged 6,700 DJI devices across 24 different countries and collected over 100,000 of their messages. If you add the company’s DJI Power portable power stations, which also phone home to these same servers, Azdoufal had access to over 10,000 devices.

When I say I couldn’t believe my eyes at first, I mean that literally. Azdoufal leads AI strategy at a vacation rental home company; when he told me he reverse engineered DJI’s protocols using Claude Code, I had to wonder whether AI was hallucinating these robots. So I asked my colleague Thomas Ricker, who just finished reviewing the DJI Romo, to pass us its serial number.

With nothing more than that 14-digit number, Azdoufal could not only pull up our robot, he could correctly see it was cleaning the living room and had 80 percent battery life remaining. Within minutes, I watched the robot generate and transmit an accurate floor plan of my colleague’s house, with the correct shape and size of each room, just by typing some digits into a laptop located in a different country.

Separately, Azdoufal pulled up his own DJI Romo’s live video feed, completely bypassing its security PIN, then walked into his living room and waved to the camera while I watched. He also says he shared a limited read-only version of his app with Gonzague Dambricourt, CTO at an IT consulting firm in France; Dambricourt tells me the app let him remotely watch his own DJI Romo’s camera feed before he even paired it.

Azdoufal was able to enable all of this without hacking into DJI’s servers, he claims. “I didn’t infringe any rules, I didn’t bypass, I didn’t crack, brute force, whatever.” He says he simply extracted his own DJI Romo’s private token — the key that tells DJI’s servers that you should have access to your own data — and those servers gave him the data of thousands of other people as well. He shows me that he can access DJI’s pre-production server, as well as the live servers for the US, China, and the EU.

Here’s the good news: On Tuesday, Azdoufal was not able to take our DJI Romo on a joyride through my colleague’s house, see through its camera, or listen through its microphone. DJI had already restricted that form of access after both Azdoufal and I told the company about the vulnerabilities.

And by Wednesday morning, Azdoufal’s scanner no longer had access to any robots, not even his own. It appears that DJI has plugged the gaping hole.

But this incident raises serious questions about DJI’s security and data practices. It will no doubt be used to help retroactively justify fears that led to the Chinese dronemaker getting largely forced out of the US. If Azdoufal could find these robots without even looking for them, will it protect them against people with intent to do harm? If Claude Code can spit out an app that lets you see into someone’s house, what keeps a DJI employee from doing so? And should a robot vacuum cleaner have a microphone? “It’s so weird to have a microphone on a freaking vacuum,” says Azdoufal.

It doesn’t help that when Azdoufal and The Verge contacted DJI about the issue, the company claimed it had fixed the vulnerability when it was actually only partially resolved.

“DJI can confirm the issue was resolved last week and remediation was already underway prior to public disclosure,” reads part of the original statement provided by DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong. We received that statement on Tuesday morning at 12:28PM ET — about half an hour before Azdoufal showed me thousands of robots, including our review unit, reporting for duty.

To be clear, it’s not surprising that a robot vacuum cleaner with a smartphone app would phone home to the cloud. For better or for worse, users currently expect those apps to work outside of their own homes. Unless you’ve built a tunnel into your own home network, that means relaying the data through cloud servers first.

But people who put a camera into their home expect that data to be protected, both in transit and once it reaches the server. Security professionals should know that — but as soon as Azdoufal connected to DJI’s MQTT servers, everything was visible in cleartext. If DJI has merely cut off one particular way into those servers, that may not be enough to protect them if hackers find another way in.

Unfortunately, DJI is far from the only smart home company that’s let people down on security. Hackers took over Ecovacs robot vacuums to chase pets and yell racist slurs in 2024. In 2025, South Korean government agencies reported that Dreame’s X50 Ultra had a flaw that could let hackers view its camera feed in real time, and that another Ecovacs and a Narwal robovac could let hackers view and steal photos from the devices. (Korea’s own Samsung and LG vacuums received high marks, and a Roborock did fine.)

It’s not just vacuums, of course. I still won’t buy a Wyze camera, despite its new security ideas, because that company tried to sweep a remote access vulnerability under the rug instead of warning its customers. I would find it hard to trust Anker’s Eufy after it lied to us about its security, too. But Anker came clean, and sunlight is a good disinfectant.

DJI is not being exceptionally transparent about what happened here, but it did answer almost all our questions. In a new statement to The Verge via spokesperson Daisy Kong, the company now admits “a backend permission validation issue” that could have theoretically let hackers see live video from its vacuums, and it admits that it didn’t fully patch that issue until after we confirmed that issues were still present.

DJI identified a vulnerability affecting DJI Home through internal review in late January and initiated remediation immediately. The issue was addressed through two updates, with an initial patch deployed on February 8 and a follow-up update completed on February 10. The fix was deployed automatically, and no user action is required.

The vulnerability involved a backend permission validation issue affecting MQTT-based communication between the device and the server. While this issue created a theoretical potential for unauthorized access to live video of ROMO device, our investigation confirms that actual occurrences were extremely rare. Nearly all identified activity was linked to independent security researchers testing their own devices for reporting purposes, with only a handful of potential exceptions.

The first patch addressed this vulnerability but had not been applied universally across all service nodes. The second patch re-enabled and restarted the remaining service nodes. This has now been fully resolved, and there is no evidence of broader impact. This was not a transmission encryption issue. ROMO device-to-server communication was not transmitted in cleartext and has always been encrypted using TLS. Data associated with ROMO devices, such as those in Europe, is stored on U.S.-based AWS cloud infrastructure.

DJI maintains strong standards for data privacy and security and has established processes for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. The company has invested in industry-standard encryption and operates a longstanding bug bounty program. We have reviewed the findings and recommendations shared by the independent security researchers who contacted us through that program as part of our standard post-remediation process. DJI will continue to implement additional security enhancements as part of its ongoing efforts.

Azdoufal says that even now, DJI hasn’t fixed all the vulnerabilities he’s found. One of them is the ability to view your own DJI Romo video stream without needing its security pin. Another one is so bad I won’t describe it until DJI has more time to fix it. DJI did not immediately promise to do so.

And both Azdoufal and security researcher Kevin Finisterre tell me it’s not enough for the Romo to send encrypted data to a US server, if anyone inside that server can easily read it afterward. “A server being based in the US in no way, shape, or form prevents .cn DJI employees from access,” Finisterre tells me. That seems evident, as Azdoufal lives in Barcelona and was able to see devices in entirely different regions.

“Once you’re an authenticated client on the MQTT broker, if there are no proper topic-level access controls (ACLs), you can subscribe to wildcard topics (e.g., #) and see all messages from all devices in plaintext at the application layer,” says Azdoufal. “TLS does nothing to prevent this — it only protects the pipe, not what’s inside the pipe from other authorized participants.”

When I tell Azdoufal that some may judge him for not giving DJI much time to resolve the issues before going public, he notes that he didn’t hack anything, didn’t expose sensitive data, and isn’t a security professional. He says he was simply livetweeting everything that happened while trying to control his robot with a PS5 gamepad.

“Yes, I don’t follow the rules, but people stick to the bug bounty program for money. I fucking don’t care, I just want this fixed,” he says. “Following the rules to the end would probably make this breach happen for a way longer time, I think.”

He doesn’t believe that DJI truly discovered these issues by itself back in January, and he’s annoyed the company only ever responded to him robotically in DMs on X, instead of answering his emails.

But he is happy about one thing: He can indeed control his Romo with a PlayStation or Xbox gamepad.

﻿Chris ‘moot’ Poole tells The Verge he regrets having ever encountered Jeffrey Epstein.

The close timing of Jeffrey Epstein coming into contact with 4chan founder Chris ‘moot’ Poole and the launch of the “politically incorrect” message board /pol/ that became a breeding ground for QAnon and the white supremacist alt-right movement was coincidental, says Poole. In a statement given to The Verge, Pool writes, “The decision to add the board was made weeks beforehand, and the board was added almost 24 hours prior to a first, chance encounter at a social event.”

Speculation about the timing arose after emails found in the millions of documents released by the Department of Justice showed Epstein and venture capitalist Boris Nikolic discussing a meeting between Epstein and moot in 2011, as well as failed attempts to meet later.

But according to moot himself, Epstein had nothing to do with what happened on the site:

Epstein had nothing to do with the reintroduction of a politics board to 4chan, nor anything else related to the site. The decision to add the board was made weeks beforehand, and the board was added almost 24 hours prior to a first, chance encounter at a social event. His assistant reached out to me afterward, and I met with him one time for an unmemorable lunch meeting. This happened at a time when I was meeting hundreds of people a month while speaking and networking at tech events.

I did not meet him again nor maintain contact. I regret having ever encountered him at all, and have deep sympathy for all of his victims.

As we reported on Thursday, while their contact may have been brief, Epstein’s influence continued to intersect with 4chan and the culture it helped produce, through his ongoing connection to former Trump advisor and Breitbart chief Steve Bannon’s efforts to elect Trump and platform far-right figures.

Valentine’s Day is often thought of as the quintessential Hallmark holiday — and why wouldn’t it be? Most of the time, it’s marketed to us with massive floral arrangements and heart-shaped chocolates, both of which can come off as borderline twee. But no one says you have to play by the rulebook when it comes to holidays, especially if your husband or boyfriend couldn’t care less about the classics.

If you’re hoping to express your affection for the man in your life with something a little different this year, we have some thoughts. Quince’s cashmere crewneck is quickly becoming a staple in our closet, while past favorites like Glocusent’s necklamp and Image3D’s custom viewfinder make for excellent substitutes if you want something less cliché. Hell, name a roach after him. We guarantee no one else will.

What follows is an array of Verge-approved ideas spanning multiple categories and price points, so you can easily find a gift for your friend, romantic partner, or any other self-proclaimed “dude” in your life.

From calls to playlists, the AirPods 4 make everything sound a little better. Apple’s latest earbuds deliver improved audio and voice call quality that’s on par with the Pro models, ensuring you come through clearly no matter what’s going on around you. The included charging case even has a built-in speaker, making them juuuust a little harder to lose.

With Hot Ones’ latest trio pack, you can subject your valentine to the same fiery gauntlet that Jason Segel, Will Arnett, and other guests were recently forced to endure. It includes the second, fifth, and final hot sauces in the series — including the iconic “Last Dab,” which is a soul-scorching blend of Apollo, Pepper X, Carolina Reaper, and Scorpion peppers.

Hazelight Studios’ follow-up to It Takes Two is, without a doubt, one of the best co-op games of the last several years. The split-screen mashup of sci-fi and fantasy pinballs between genres at breakneck speed, introducing new ideas and novel gameplay elements at every turn. Now, let’s hope you and your partner have a good working relationship.

Not every massage gun needs to exert an exorbitant amount of pressure. The five-speed Mebak 3 takes a more subtle approach, which, unlike other models, prevents it from drowning out your TV. It’s also unique in that comes with seven (!) distinct add-ons, including a blade-like shovel attachment and a flat cushiony head aimed at more sensitive tissues and joints.

Given the number of books in the world, sometimes it’s nice to have somebody narrow down the list on your behalf. A Book of the Month membership lets your giftee periodically choose from a curated selection of up to seven titles, including literary classics, bestsellers, and early releases spanning a variety of well-known genres.

Nomad’s Leather Mag Wallet is two gifts in one. Not only does the slick snap-on wallet let you store up to four cards at once, but it also doubles as an AirTag, allowing you to locate your wallet via Apple’s Find My network. The magnetic, iPhone-friendly accessory also charges wirelessly, enabling up to five months of battery life.

Your most sentimental photos with your valentine will pack an extra punch with Image3D’s RetroViewer. The retro-styled viewfinder comes with a code to upload seven photos — whether they’re of your first date, wedding, or latest vacay — which you can then edit and package into your own DIY reel for when those nostalgic moments overtake you.

Powerful power banks don’t have to be cumbersome. Iniu’s 10,000mAh P50 is about as thick as a deck of cards, but features 45W charging speeds, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. Its braided lanyard also doubles as a USB-C cable, providing everything you need to keep all of your electronics fully juiced on the go.

Whether your valentine collects Funko Pops or not, gifting them a custom model is sure to delight them. Using an online module, you can fine-tune a variety of features — including their hairstyle, skin tone, and getup — and each custom Funko comes in a box, just like the collectible ones based on Star Wars and other iconic fandoms.

It’s easy enough to run the vacuum in the living room and call it a day. But other areas where your valentine might enjoy spending their time — at the computer, in the car, etc. — can be tougher to clean. That’s where Hoto’s sleek, 20,000Pa handheld vacuum and its slew of attachment heads come in.

Quince is quickly becoming a household name, particularly for wool basics. And if your valentine doesn’t have any cashmere in their collection, the company’s ultra-soft crewneck is a fantastic gift that can keep them warm and stylish during the coldest months of the year. The fact that it’s available in 15 different colors is just a plus.

A subscription to The Criterion Channel is the ultimate gift for a movie lover. The service lets you stream some of the greatest movies of all time, from The Shining to Once Upon a Time in America. It also includes access to Criterion 24/7, an endless stream of movies that you can watch when you don’t want to make a decision.

The past few months might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Nice Cube, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

Let’s face it, many of us have called roaches unsavory things, typically from a place of fear. However, if you want to redeem yourself somehow, the Bronx Zoo will let you name your very own Madagascar hissing cockroach in the name of love. You can even schedule a “virtual encounter” for your giftee, if they’re feeling up for it.

Got a boyfriend or husband who loves to golf? Paper Apps Golf is a pocket-sized game that lets them hit the proverbial green just about anywhere. The 60-page notebook features three randomly generated courses, each with 18 holes, along with a brief overview of how to play. Just be sure to grab a Pencil dice (sold separately) to go with it.

If you’re okay with shelling out on a console, look no further than the Switch 2. Nintendo’s latest hybrid boasts a spacious 7.9-inch display, a comfortable design, and backward compatibility with most OG Switch titles, some of which have even been updated to run at higher resolutions and frame rates. Fair to say, Donkey Kong has never looked better.

Whether you’re relaxing at home or braving the elements, keeping your extremities warm is paramount. Fortunately, Unihand’s rechargeable hand warmers can keep your digits limber for up to 20 hours on a single charge; they also feature three distinct warmth levels, the most powerful of which can hit 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

Apple’s latest AirTags feel purpose-built for the forgetful boyfriend. The second-gen item tracker features an upgraded ultra-wideband chip for more precise location tracking, a noticeably louder speaker, and an expanded Bluetooth range. You’ll still need an iPhone to make the most of it, though, as well as a separate accessory to attach it to your belongings.

Lego’s smiling, potted plants might be intended for kids, but they make for a fun piece of desk decor that’s sure to lighten up any space without requiring additional aftercare. The cutsey duo is easy to assemble, and each plant is interchangeable with either pot, letting you mix and match as you see fit.

Fender has made it easy for guitarists to feel like they’re plugged in wherever they are. The Micro Plus is a compact headphone amp with 50 effects that lets you rock out using the headphones you already own, whether they’re a pair of shoddy earbuds or studio-caliber cans. Best of all, it works with a range of guitar types, from straight-sided to the angular variety.

Attending a dedicated first aid or CPR class through the Red Cross probably isn’t high on your list of date-night activities. However, it’s pretty cool to know that, after a few self-paced online courses and an hour or two of in-person practical instruction, both you and your partner can be heroes should you encounter someone who needs life-saving help.

The key to making a truly spectacular cocktail isn’t just the combination of ingredients — though, we admit that’s part of it. In Liquid Intelligence, Dave Arnold makes the case that the smallest details are what make all the difference, especially in terms of taste and appearance. And who are we to argue with bar-backed science?

What’s mightier than the pen? A pen that can also serve as an LED flashlight, a ruler, a bubble level, a screwdriver, a bottle opener, and a smartphone-ready stylus. The 9-in-1 Builder Pen might just be the most capable tool you can add to your everyday carry, even if you never write a thing with it.

If your partner likes to burn the midnight oil reading, like, actual books, Glocusent’s wearable necklamp could be a godsend. The handy gizmo provides a soft, warm glow and several brightness settings, letting your loved one comfortably read in the dark without waking you up with a deluge of lumens.

Cards Against Humanity is overrated. Wingspan, however, plays as beautifully as it looks, while offering just the right amount of strategy and a unique way to learn about various species. If you and your valentine are looking to move beyond the basics, this bird-themed engine-building board game is a must, whether you like birds or not.

The Amazfit Active 2 is the kind of smartwatch that defies the odds. It’s equipped with a bright 2,000-nit OLED display and an array of upgraded health sensors, along with offline maps and a slick strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest. It even supports its own AI assistant, Zepp Flow, which is wild for a watch that retails for less than $100.

The Backbone might be the most flexible mobile controller out there. The USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad via Bluetooth.

Sonido Cosmico is a vibe. The latest LP from Hermanos Gutiérrez brims with lush instrumental guitar and a range of otherwordly influences, including Latin percussion, warm strings, and just the right amount of psychedelia. None of that should come as a suprise, though, given the duo recently opened for the likes of The Black Keys and Khruangbin.

Most of us at The Verge are hooked on coffee, and the winter months are a terrible time to be surprised by a cold cup of the black stuff. Thankfully, Ember’s ceramic Smart Mug keeps your beverage heated to your preferred temperature for up to 80 minutes (or indefinitely when it’s resting on the included charging coaster).

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

The Fanttik X8 Apex is the kind of gift that keeps on giving, even if you’d prefer to never use it. The compact tire inflator features a built-in LCD display and can deliver up to 150psi, allowing your giftee to quickly top off their car or road bike with the right amount of air. It even functions as a power bank and charges via USB-C, just to make things easy.

The Notes app in iOS is great, but sometimes pen and paper are where it’s at. Field Notes are small enough to fit in your pocket or a small bag, yet spacious enough to house all your big ideas and errant thoughts. The “1943” Edition — the company’s first with two staples on the short side — can even add a much-needed pop of color to any desk setup.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O’Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services.

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. And we need to be ready for what comes next. Read the full story.—Rhiannon Williams

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect.

            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <h2>Anthropic’s $30B raise is about more than money</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/anthropics-30b-raise-is-about-more-than-money">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.
