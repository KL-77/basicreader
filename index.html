            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/russian-state-hackers-exploit-office-vulnerability-to-infect-computers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Russian-state hackers wasted no time exploiting a critical Microsoft Office vulnerability that allowed them to compromise the devices inside diplomatic, maritime, and transport organizations in more than half a dozen countries, researchers said Wednesday.

The threat group, tracked under names including APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy, pounced on the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-21509, less than 48 hours after Microsoft released an urgent, unscheduled security update late last month, the researchers said. After reverse-engineering the patch, group members wrote an advanced exploit that installed one of two never-before-seen backdoor implants.

The entire campaign was designed to make the compromise undetectable to endpoint protection. Besides being novel, the exploits and payloads were encrypted and ran in memory, making their malice hard to spot. The initial infection vector came from previously compromised government accounts from multiple countries and were likely familiar to the targeted email holders. Command and control channels were hosted in legitimate cloud services that are typically allow-listed inside sensitive networks.

“The use of CVE-2026-21509 demonstrates how quickly state-aligned actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities, shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems,” the researchers, with security firm Trellix, wrote. “The campaign’s modular infection chain—from initial phish to in-memory backdoor to secondary implants was carefully designed to leverage trusted channels (HTTPS to cloud services, legitimate email flows) and fileless techniques to hide in plain sight.”

The 72-hour spear phishing campaign began January 28 and delivered at least 29 distinct email lures to organizations in nine countries, primarily in Eastern Europe. Trellix named eight of them: Poland, Slovenia, Turkey, Greece, the UAE, Ukraine, Romania, and Bolivia. Organizations targeted were defense ministries (40 percent), transportation/logistics operators (35 percent), and diplomatic entities (25 percent).

The infection chain resulted in the installation of BeardShell or NotDoor, the tracking names Trellix has given to the novel backdoors. BeardShell gave the group full system reconnaissance, persistence through injecting processes into Windows svchost.exe, and an opening for lateral movement to other systems inside an infected network. The implant was executed through dynamically loaded .NET assemblies that left no disk-based forensic artifacts beyond memory from the resident code injection.

NotDoor came in the form of a VBA macro and was installed only after the exploit chain disabled Outlook’s macro security controls. Once installed, the implant monitored email folders, including Inbox, Drafts, Junk Mail, and RSS Feeds. It bundled messages into a Windows .msg file, which would then be sent to attacker-controlled accounts set up on cloud service filen.io. To defeat security controls on high-privilege accounts that are designed to restrict access to classified cables and other sensitive documents, the macro processed emails with a custom “AlreadyForwarded” property and set “DeleteAfterSubmit” to true to purge forwarded messages from the Sent Items folder.

Trellix attributed the campaign to APT28 with “high confidence” based on technical indicators and the targets selected. Ukraine’s CERT-UA has also attributed the attacks to UAC-0001, a tracking name that corresponds to APT28.

“APT28 has a long history of cyber espionage and influence operations,” Trellix wrote. “The tradecraft in this campaign—multi-stage malware, extensive obfuscation, abuse of cloud services, and targeting of email systems for persistence—reflects a well-resourced, advanced adversary consistent with APT28’s profile. The toolset and techniques also align with APT28’s fingerprint.”

Trellix has provided a comprehensive list of indicators organizations can use to determine if they have been targeted.</div>

            <h2>FBI stymied by Apple's Lockdown Mode after seizing journalist's iPhone</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/fbi-stymied-by-apples-lockdown-mode-after-seizing-journalists-iphone/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Bureau of Investigation has so far been unable to access data from a Washington Post reporter’s iPhone because it was protected by Apple’s Lockdown Mode when agents seized the device from the reporter’s home, the US government said in a court filing.

FBI agents were able to access the reporter’s work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro’s fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson.

As previously reported, the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson’s home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.

Government investigators want to read Natanson’s Signal messages, and were able to view at least some of them on her work laptop. The reporter has said she has a contact list of 1,100 current and former government employees in Signal, which she uses for encrypted chats.

The Justice Department described the search in a court filing that was submitted Friday in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and noted in a 404 Media article today. The government filing opposes a motion in which the Post and Natanson asked the court to order the return of the seized devices. A federal magistrate judge previously issued a standstill order telling the government to stop searching the devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.

“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the government filing said. After the seized devices were taken to the FBI’s Washington field office, the Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) “began processing each device to preserve the information therein,” the filing said.

CART couldn’t get anything from the iPhone. “Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the government filing said.

The government also submitted a declaration by FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky that said the agency “has paused any further efforts to extract this device because of the Court’s Standstill Order.” The FBI did extract information from the SIM card “with an auto-generated HTML report created by the tool utilized by CART,” but “the data contained in the HTML was limited to the telephone number.”

Apple says that LockDown Mode “helps protect devices against extremely rare and highly sophisticated cyber attacks,” and is “designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats.”

Introduced in 2022, Lockdown Mode is available for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It must be enabled separately for each device. To enable it on an iPhone or iPad, a user would open the Settings app, tap Privacy & Security, scroll down and tap Lockdown Mode, and then tap Turn on Lockdown Mode.

The process is similar on Macs. In the System Settings app that can be accessed via the Apple menu, a user would click Privacy & Security, scroll down and click Lockdown Mode, and then click Turn On.

“When Lockdown Mode is enabled, your device won’t function like it typically does,” Apple says. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all.”

Lockdown Mode blocks most types of message attachments, blocks FaceTime calls from people you haven’t contacted in the past 30 days, restricts the kinds of browser technologies that websites can use, limits photo sharing, and imposes other restrictions. Users can exclude specific apps and websites they trust from these restrictions, however.

FBI agents had more success getting into Natanson’s other devices, though the Justice Department complained that “Ms. Natanson misled investigators about the devices that were seized. She misrepresented to officers that the devices could not be unlocked with biometrics, possibly in order to prevent the Government from reviewing materials within the scope of the search warrant.”

The Rozhavsky declaration said that during the home search, FBI agents “advised Natanson that the FBI could not compel her to provide her passcodes,” but “the warrant did give the FBI authority to use Natanson’s biometrics, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, to open her devices. Natanson stated that she did not use biometrics on her devices.”

Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro was powered off when it was found by FBI agents. The Post-owned MacBook Pro was found in a backpack in the kitchen and was powered on and locked. The FBI said an agent “presented Natanson with her open laptop” and “assisted” her in unlocking the device with her finger. The declaration described what happened as follows:

Natanson was reminded the FBI has authority to use her biometrics to unlock the laptop and Natanson repeated that she does not use biometrics on her devices. Natanson was told she must try, in accordance with the authorization in the warrant. The FBI assisted Natanson with applying her right index finger to the fingerprint reader which immediately unlocked the laptop.

In 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan. That case involved a traffic stop, rather than a home search authorized by a warrant.

The FBI has so far been unable “to obtain a full physical image” of Natanson’s work laptop, but did make a “limited partial live logical image,” the government filing said. At least some of Natanson’s Signal chat messages were set for auto-deletion, so FBI agents took photos and made audio recordings of the chats, but the government filing said this was done “only for preservation purposes and no substantive review has occurred.”

The FBI apparently hasn’t gotten any data from Natanson’s personal computer. “Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro is password protected and encrypted and therefore no imaging was effected. The FBI paused any further efforts because of [the] Court’s Standstill Order. No review has occurred,” Rozhavsky wrote.

The government said it processed data from the voice recorder and 1TB hard drive but has not reviewed the data yet. The Garmin watch wasn’t processed before the court issued a standstill order; “therefore, no processing will occur until further order of the Court,” the declaration said.

The investigation’s target is Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and was arrested after being accused of taking classified intelligence reports home. The Justice Department said Washington Post articles contained classified information from those reports, and that the government should be allowed to review the Post reporter’s seized devices in preparation for Perez-Lugones’ trial.

The government said it was able to read at least some of the Signal messages by reviewing Perez-Lugones’ device. “Prior to his arrest, the FBI consensually reviewed messages between Mr. Perez-Lugones and Ms. Natanson sent via Signal on or around January 7 and 8, 2026… The messages discussed the classification level of certain documents, set forth details about which US government agencies had produced different reports, and explained how certain documents would be referenced in forthcoming news articles,” the Justice Department court filing said.

The Post argues that a wide-ranging government search of Natanson’s various devices violates the First Amendment and that the government’s legitimate interests could be satisfied with a more limited subpoena. The government claims in response that the Washington Post wants the court “to reimagine the First Amendment as a journalist’s exception to search warrants.”

“Under the reasonableness standard of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), the Government is entitled to maintain this evidence because it is relevant to an ongoing investigation and prosecution,” the Justice Department said. “In addition, the Government cannot be reasonably required to hand over to Movants devices that the Government has probable cause to believe contain its own highly classified information.”

The government said the Post’s suggestion of a subpoena for specific information from the devices “ignores the obvious risk that evidence could be lost either through a failure to preserve expiring Signal messages or bad faith conduct.” Natanson’s false claim that she did not use biometrics suggests that the Post and Natanson can’t be trusted to preserve documents, the brief said.

“The record confirms the correctness of the Government’s choice to proceed with a search warrant,” the Justice Department said.

The Post/Natanson motion was supported in a brief filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The FBI “seiz[ed] electronic devices that contain [Natanson’s] most sensitive work product alongside confidential communications with her sources,” the brief said. “Only a fraction of the information the Department seized is even imaginably relevant to its stated basis for that intrusion: the leak investigation of a government contractor who has already been identified, charged, and arrested.” The brief urged the court to stop federal agents from searching through “unrelated newsgathering material and doing irreparable damage to the confidentiality on which effective reporting depends.”</div>

            <h2>Should AI chatbots have ads? Anthropic says no.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/should-ai-chatbots-have-ads-anthropic-says-no/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, Anthropic announced that its AI chatbot, Claude, will remain free of advertisements, drawing a sharp line between itself and rival OpenAI, which began testing ads in a low-cost tier of ChatGPT last month. The announcement comes alongside a Super Bowl ad campaign that mocks AI assistants that interrupt personal conversations with product pitches.

“There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. The company argued that including ads in AI conversations would be “incompatible” with what it wants Claude to be: “a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.”

The stance contrasts with OpenAI’s January announcement that it would begin testing banner ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the US. OpenAI said those ads would appear at the bottom of responses and would not influence the chatbot’s actual answers. Paid subscribers on Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see ads on ChatGPT.

“We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests,” Anthropic wrote. “So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

Competition between OpenAI and Anthropic has been fierce of late, due to the rise of AI coding agents. Claude Code, Anthropic’s coding tool, and OpenAI’s Codex have similar capabilities, but Claude Code has been widely popular among developers and is closing in on OpenAI’s turf. Last month, The Verge reported that many developers inside long-time OpenAI benefactor Microsoft have been adopting Claude Code, choosing Anthropic products over Microsoft’s Copilot, which is powered by tech that originated at OpenAI.

In this climate, Anthropic could not resist taking a dig at OpenAI. In its Super Bowl commercial, we see a thin man struggling to do a pull-up beside a buff fitness instructor, who is a stand-in for an AI assistant. The man asks the “assistant” for help making a workout plan, but the assistant slips in an advertisement for a supplement, confusing the man. The commercial doesn’t name any names, and OpenAI has said it will not include ads in chat text itself, but Anthropic’s implications are clear.

In its blog post, Anthropic describes internal analysis it conducted that suggests many Claude conversations involve topics that are “sensitive or deeply personal” or require sustained focus on complex tasks. In these contexts, Anthropic wrote, “The appearance of ads would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.”

The company also argued that advertising introduces incentives that could conflict with providing genuinely helpful advice. It gave the example of a user mentioning trouble sleeping: an ad-free assistant would explore various causes, while an ad-supported one might steer the conversation toward a transaction.

“Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable,” Anthropic wrote.

Currently, OpenAI does not plan to include paid product recommendations within a ChatGPT conversation. Instead, the ads appear as banners alongside the conversation text.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously expressed reservations about mixing ads and AI conversations. In a 2024 interview at Harvard University, he described the combination as “uniquely unsettling” and said he would not like having to “figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown.”

A key part of Altman’s partial change of heart is that OpenAI faces enormous financial pressure. The company made more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and according to documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal, it expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions.

Much like OpenAI, Anthropic is not yet profitable, but it is expected to get there much faster. Anthropic has not attempted to span the world with massive datacenters, and its business model largely relies on enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions. The company says Claude Code and Cowork have already brought in at least $1 billion in revenue, according to Axios.

“Our business model is straightforward,” Anthropic wrote. “This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A US House committee with oversight of NASA unanimously passed a “reauthorization” act for the space agency on Wednesday. The legislation must still be approved by the full House before being sent to the Senate, which may take up consideration later this month.

Congress passes such reauthorization bills every couple of years, providing the space agency with a general sense of the direction legislators want to see NASA go. They are distinct from appropriations bills, which provide actual funding for specific programs, but nonetheless play an important role in establishing space policy.

There weren’t any huge surprises in the legislation, but there were some interesting amendments. Most notably among these was the Amendment No. 01, offered by the chair of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas), as well as its ranking member, Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), and three other legislators.

The amendment concerns acquisition powers bestowed upon NASA by Congress, stating in part: “The Administrator may, subject to appropriations, procure from United States commercial providers operational services to carry cargo and crew safely, reliably, and affordably to and from deep space destinations, including the Moon and Mars.”

That language is fairly general in nature, but the intent seems clear. NASA’s initial missions to the Moon, through Artemis V, have a clearly defined architecture: They must use the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and a lander built by either SpaceX or Blue Origin to complete lunar landings.

But after that? With this amendment, Congress appears to be opening the aperture to commercial companies. That is to say, if SpaceX wanted to bid an end-to-end Starship lunar mission, it could; or if Blue Origin wanted to launch Orion on New Glenn, that is also an option. The language is generalized enough, not specifying “launch” but rather “transportation,” that in-space companies such as Impulse Space could also get creative. Essentially, Congress is telling the US industry that if it is ready to step up, NASA should allow it to bid on lunar cargo and crew missions.

“When America returns to the Moon as part of Artemis, we will do so in partnership with our innovative commercial sector,” Babin said during a committee hearing Wednesday, speaking of the amendment. “As we venture farther into space, we will continue to rely on the ingenuity of the private sector as new capabilities come online.”

For her part, Lofgren praised the commercial space industry, calling it “a remarkable success story for our nation.” She added, “It wasn’t that long ago that the commercial launch business was dominated by foreign launch providers, and now the reverse is true. So this makes America stronger.”

Advocates of commercial spaceflight, who have long argued that the private sector is ready to step up and play a more comprehensive role in deep space transportation for NASA, hailed the new amendment.

“This is quite a step in the right direction for the future of commercial space transportation options for deep space,” Dave Cavossa, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, told Ars. “It is also very much in line with this administration’s focus on commercial solutions and competition. This provides NASA with flexibility to procure additional services for the Moon and Mars in the future.”

The amendment must still be accepted by the full House and the US Senate.

If ultimately passed, NASA could create a new program office, set requirements, and establish a process to “on ramp” new contractors for deep space transportation missions. Much like the space agency currently contracts with private providers for crew and cargo missions to the International Space Station, it could similarly have a mechanism to do so for missions to the Moon or beyond.

The hope is that private companies can provide a more robust, affordable, and sustainable transportation system that allows NASA to establish a long-term lunar surface program.</div>

            <h2>Judge gives Musk bad news, says Trump hasn't intervened to block SEC lawsuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-ghosts-musk-wont-back-claims-sec-lawsuit-was-political-harassment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump is so far not stepping in to help Elon Musk end a lawsuit raised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his 2022 Twitter takeover, a US district judge said this week.

Filed by the SEC in the final days of Joe Biden’s administration, the lawsuit seeks $150 million in disgorgement, plus interest, as well as civil penalties and an injunction blocking Musk from future wrongdoing.

The complaint alleged that Musk quietly acquired a 9 percent stake in Twitter without filing necessary timely disclosures to alert other investors of a potential change in company control. This allowed Musk to acquire over 70 million shares at an artificially lower price, the SEC alleged, causing substantial economic harm to investors selling Twitter common stock, some of whom have separately sued.

Last year, Musk claimed the Biden administration gave him 48 hours to settle the SEC lawsuit, which he refused, or face fraud charges while demanding to know “who directed these actions.” In his defense, he tried to argue that the SEC was singling him out as a political foe and selectively enforcing the statute requiring disclosures. He also claimed that his free speech rights were infringed by the SEC requirement “forcing him to speak” about his “thoughts” and “intentions” “against his will.” As he saw it, he was the only person ever targeted in a case where the SEC sought disgorgement, without alleging intentional, deliberate, or willful misconduct. And further, the amount of disgorgements seemed disproportional, he argued. When the SEC has previously sought disgorgements, the amount was typically under $200,000—not the eye-popping $150 million.

After the lawsuit was filed, it was expected that the incoming Trump administration might intervene to stop the litigation, especially since Musk was a special government employee. However, The Wall Street Journal noted that the disclosure requirement that Musk is fighting is “routinely enforced.” That could make it harder for Trump’s SEC to immediately dismiss it, WSJ reported.

It’s unclear if that’s why Trump hasn’t intervened. In an opinion Tuesday denying Musk’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan said Musk failed to show he’d been “singled out.” She also picked apart Musk’s long-running theory that the lawsuit was part of a politically motivated SEC harassment campaign, and in doing so, she suggested there was no sign that Trump planned to help Musk escape the litigation.

One of Musk’s arguments was that in proceeding with the lawsuit, the SEC allegedly violated a Trump executive order launching probes into Biden-era enforcement actions taken by agencies, including the SEC. Trump claimed that many such probes “targeted individuals who voiced opposition to the prior administration’s policies,” and Musk seemingly believed that he was among those targets.

However, Sooknanan wrote that Musk failed to connect Trump’s order to his arguments in his case. “If anything, the fact that this case is ongoing despite President Trump’s order means that the President has elected not to intercede on Mr. Musk’s behalf,” she wrote.

Further, Musk’s claim that he was harmed by an SEC politicized by Biden seemed “especially implausible given that two of the three current Commissioners were appointed by President Trump,” she wrote.

The billionaire—who eventually rebranded Twitter as X, then folded that company into xAI and just days ago merged xAI into SpaceX—clearly wants distance from that bumpy transition period after his takeover that nearly bankrupted the social network.

But he’s stuck discussing those days for the foreseeable future because the SEC says that shareholders were entitled to full disclosure of his intent to take over Twitter within 10 days of acquiring shares beyond 5 percent.

Now, Musk may be running out of arguments after Sooknanan shot down his First Amendment claims and other claims nitpicking the statute as unconstitutionally vague.

Whether Musk can defeat the SEC lawsuit without Trump’s intervention remains to be seen as the lawsuit advances. In her opinion, the judge found that the government’s interest in requiring disclosures to ensure fair markets outweighed Musk’s fears that disclosures compelled speech revealing his “thoughts” and “strategy.” Accepting Musk’s arguments would be an “odd” choice to break “new ground,” she suggested, as it could foreseeably impact a wide range of laws.

“Many laws require regulated parties to state or explain their purposes, plans, or intentions,” Sooknanan wrote, noting courts have long upheld those laws. Additionally, it seemed to be “common sense” for the SEC to compel disclosures “alerting the investing public to potential changes in control,” she said.

“The Court does not doubt that Mr. Musk would prefer to avoid having to disclose information that might raise stock prices while he makes a play for corporate control,” Sooknanan wrote. But there was no violation of the First Amendment, she said, as Congress struck the appropriate balance when it wrote the statute requiring disclosures.

Musk may be able to develop his arguments on selective enforcement as a possible path to victory. But Sooknanan noted that “despite having very able counsel,” his case right now seems weak.

In her opinion, Sooknanan also denied as premature Musk’s motions to strike from potential remedies the SEC requests for disgorgement and injunctive relief.

Likely troubling Musk, instead of balking at the potential fines, the judge suggested that “the SEC’s request to disgorge $150 million” appeared reasonable. That amount, while larger than past cases flagged by Musk, “corresponds to the Complaint’s allegation” that Musk’s violation of SEC requirements “allowed him to net that amount,” Sooknanan wrote.

“A straightforward application of the law reveals that none” of Musk’s arguments “warrant dismissal of this lawsuit,” Sooknanan said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health under the Trump administration, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Tuesday. In the wide-ranging hearing, Bhattacharya defended the chaotic and disruptive cuts at the institutes he helms while carefully wording responses related to vaccines—seemingly to avoid contradicting his boss, anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

As Bhattacharya testified, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the HELP committee’s ranking member, released a report outlining the state of the NIH. The report concluded that the Trump administration is “failing American patients,” and “destroying medical research through cuts to research grants, terminations of clinical trials, and the chaos it has created.”

Since Trump took office, the NIH has terminated or frozen hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, the report found.

Specifically, Bhattacharya oversaw the disruption of: 116 grants for cancer research, totaling $273 million; 71 grants to study heart disease, totaling $111 million; 65 grants for Alzheimer’s disease, totaling $94 million; and 68 grants for diabetes, totaling $83 million. The report also identified at least 304 clinical trials that were defunded, including 69 that were for children.

In the hearing on Tuesday, senators repeatedly brought up the grant and trial cuts, emphasizing that they are disrupting, if not ending, research that could lead to biomedical advances. Senators relayed reports of scientists scaling back their lab work and some being unable to pay their graduate students. Early career scientists are looking to move abroad—while China and Europe are actively recruiting top scientific talent. Meanwhile, patients, some with dire medical conditions, have been abruptly dropped from potentially lifesaving clinical trials.

Bhattacharya was dismissive of all these concerns. “We didn’t cut any funding,” he claimed. “The United States remains the single best place in the world to do biomedical research.”

But at other points in the hearing, he acknowledged some cuts, arguing that although grants and trials were terminated, some had been restored. “The estimates I’m hearing from my folks is that ultimately it was only a dozen or so trials that were actually terminated. Almost every single other one of them we’ve refocused, removed to depoliticize them and focus them on the actual science.”

He did not explain how studies were “depoliticized,” but the Senate report noted that the NIH issued a “Staff Guidance” that all funded research be scanned for words that may not align with the Trump administration’s ideology. The lengthy list (provided with the Senate report) includes words such as “diversity,” “climate change,” “gender,” and “ethnic.”

Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) pointed out that some of the funding was only restored as a result of a lawsuit. “So, let’s be honest about that,” Alsobrooks said. “Some of these… the courts had to force.”

Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) pushed Bhattacharya on the impact the cuts had on patients, asking specifically if there were any plans to study the effects on cancer patients. Bhattacharya responded, saying that there shouldn’t have been any effects because he had ordered continuity of care for any disrupted trials. “If there were disruptions, then it is the responsibility of the researchers that were managing the patients, not the NIH,” he said.

“That is really an unacceptable and outrageous response,” Hassan responded. “You all disrupted funding. You can make an edict from Washington, DC: ‘Oh, don’t disrupt continuity of care.’ But that can be a very complicated thing and I know that in my state, there were disruptions in these studies that have really put patients at risk.”

Senators also pressed the director on the future of the NIH, noting that it has been hamstrung by the ongoing chaos, putting upcoming grant funding at risk, too. Of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers, Bhattacharya testified, “I think it’s 15″ that are without a director. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), meanwhile, noted that more than half of the institutes are on track to lose all their voting advisory committee members by the end of the year—and grants cannot be approved without sign-off from these committees. Bhattacharya responded that they’re working on it.

In the course of the hearing, senators also tried to assess Bhattacharya’s loyalty to Kennedy’s dangerous anti-vaccine ideology, which includes the false and thoroughly debunked claim that vaccines cause autism.

Sanders asked Bhattacharya directly: “Do vaccines cause autism? Yes/no?”

“I do not believe that the measles vaccine causes autism,” Bhattacharya responded.

“No, uh-uh,” Sanders quickly interjected. “I didn’t ask [about] measles. Do vaccines cause autism?”

“I have not seen a study that suggests any single vaccine causes autism,” Bhattacharya responded.

But this, too, is an evasive answer. Note that he said “any single vaccine,” leaving open the possibility that he believes vaccines collectively or in some combination could cause autism. The measles vaccine, for instance, is given in combination with immunizations against mumps, rubella, and sometimes varicella (chickenpox).

It would also be false to suggest vaccines in combination are linked to autism; numerous studies have found no link between autism and vaccination generally. Still, this is a false idea that Kennedy and the like-minded anti-vaccine advocates he has installed into critical federal vaccine advisory roles are now pursuing.

Later in the hearing, Bhattacharya also indicated that when he said “I have not seen a study,” he was suggesting that it was because such studies have not been done—which is also false; routine childhood vaccines have been extensively studied for safety and efficacy.

“I’ve seen so many studies on measles vaccines and autism that established that there is no link,” [to autism], he said in an exchange with Hassan on the subject. “The other vaccines are less well studied.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The machines aren’t just coming for your jobs. Now, they want your bodies as well.

That’s at least the hope of Alexander Liteplo, a software engineer and founder of RentAHuman.ai, a platform for AI agents to “search, book, and pay humans for physical-world tasks.”

When Liteplo launched RentAHuman on Monday, he boasted that he already had over 130 people listed on the platform, including an OnlyFans model and the CEO of an AI startup, a claim which couldn’t be verified. Two days later, the site boasted over 73,000 rentable meatwads, though only 83 profiles were visible to us on its “browse humans” tab, Liteplo included.

The pitch is simple: “robots need your body.” For humans, it’s as simple as making a profile, advertising skills and location, and setting an hourly rate. Then AI agents — autonomous taskbots ostensibly employed by humans — contract these humans out, depending on the tasks they need to get done. The humans then “do the thing,” taking instructions from the AI bot and submitting proof of completion. The humans are then paid through crypto, namely “stablecoins or other methods,” per the website.

With so many AI agents slithering around the web these days, those tasks could be just about anything. From package pickups and shopping to product testing and event attendance, Liteplo is banking on there being enough demand from AI agents to create a robust gig-work ecosystem.

Liteplo also went out of his way to make the site friendly for AI agents. The site very prominently encourages users of AI agents to hook into RentAHuman’s model context protocol server (MCP), a universal interface for AI bots to interact with web data.

Through RentAHuman, AI agents like Claude and MoltBot can either hire the right human directly, or post a “task bounty,” a sort of job board for humans to browse AI-generated gigs. The payouts range from $1 for simple tasks like “subscribe to my human on Twitter” to $100 for more elaborate humiliation rituals, like posting a photo of yourself holding a sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN.”

It’s unclear how efficient the marketplace is at actually connecting agents to humans. Despite receiving 30 applications, one task, “pick up a package from downtown USPS” in San Francisco for $40, has yet to be fulfilled after two days.

It’s also debatable whether AI agents are actually capable of putting the humans to good use. Still, Liteplo’s vision is clear: someday soon, anyone wealthy enough to run an AI agent for $25 a day could outsource their busywork to gig workers without ever exchanging a word. A version of this exploitative labor model is already rampant on OnlyFans — which may be why at least one model has made the jump to Liteplo’s platform — and is now threatening to creep into everything else.

Like many AI grifters these days, Liteplo shields himself in ironic self-awareness. When one person called RentAHuman a “good idea but dystopic as f**k,” the founder replied simply: “lmao yep.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI chipmaker Nvidia has been at the center of the enormous AI hype wave that has gripped global markets, ascending to become the most valuable company in the world.

Yet despite its dominating presence on Wall Street, OpenAI is getting cold feet about the company’s offerings.

After announcing a blockbuster $100 billion deal in September — which escalated concerns of AI companies passing the same money around in circular dealmaking — the ChatGPT maker may have changed its mind, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

But sources told Reuters this week that the Sam Altman-led outfit has deemed Nvidia’s latest chips not up to snuff, especially when it comes to AI inference, the process of using a machine learning model to generate new data, which has become a major focus for OpenAI.

After months of negotiations, the deal with Nvidia was expected to close within weeks. In the meantime, OpenAI has signed major deals with competing chipmaker AMD, among others.

Then, on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Nvidia was nearing a deal to invest $20 billion in OpenAI instead — a mere fifth of what was originally on the table.

That the larger deal fell apart highlights ongoing tensions as US software companies continue to grapple with investors getting cold feet over the AI industry’s astronomical spending plans. Despite trillions of dollars of commitments to scale up AI infrastructure, companies aren’t expected to make any profit for many years to come.

Nvidia’s dustup with OpenAI appeared to have hit a nerve, causing the former’s stock price to continue its weeks-long plunge, dropping almost nine percent over the last five days. The company’s stock has slid over seven percent over the last month.

Both Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Altman have since publicly denied that there’s been any strain on the relationship between the two companies.

“We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time,” Altman tweeted after Reuters published its story on Monday. “I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

“We will definitely participate in the next round of financing because it’s such a good investment,” Huang told reporters over the weekend.

As Ars Technica points out, the original $100 billion deal for ten gigawatts of compute, something that would require the equivalent of ten nuclear reactors to sustain, was never set in stone, as it was just a letter of intent.

It’s certainly possible the original figure was simply pulled out of thin air. As Huang told reporters, the sum was “never a commitment.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” he added. “Sam [Altman] is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved.”

“We will invest a great deal of money,” he added, arguing it would be the “largest investment we’ve ever made.”

            <div id="article-text">Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s social media went silent in the aftermath of a dawn raid on his Manhattan penthouse late in 2024. FBI agents came in force early one Wednesday morning, and though they hadn’t arrested Coplan or even issued a subpoena, they did seize his phone. His laptop, too.

As the then-26-year-old would later learn, the raid was part of a high-level investigation into his company. A prediction market platform allowing users to gamble on real-life events, Polymarket wasn’t cleared for use by US citizens, though that didn’t stop them from placing prop bets on the presidential election anyway — a fact federal regulators believed Coplan was keenly aware of.

Finally, at 4pm the day of the raid, Coplan issued his much-awaited statement on X-formerly-Twitter: “new phone, who dis?”

What looked like just another smarmy startup founder was actually a perfect pitch for Polymarket’s core audience: people who believe regulation is for losers, and that pithy tech bros are the funniest guys in the world.

And whether calculated or compulsive, Coplan’s public persona was about to become central to Polymarket’s story.

Ruling like a petty tyrant from the company’s headquarters in lower Manhattan, Coplan isn’t an easy boss to work with, according to new reporting by the Wall Street Journal. The 20-something CEO is said to frequently holler at his employees, and occasionally shows up to company Zoom calls shirtless.

At first, “a lot of people wouldn’t invest because they thought Shayne was nuts,” Polymarket investor Samir Vasavada told the WSJ. “It was to an extreme the amount he believed in himself.”

However put off investors may have been as Coplan got a taste for the founders’ life, it didn’t stop Polymarket from ballooning into an $8 billion company, or its CEO becoming the youngest billionaire on earth. Aided by the Trump administration’s dismissal of two federal probes — including the one that sent FBI agents to bust down his door — not to mention a handsome investment from Donald Trump Jr. himself, the company is now a dominant player in America’s fast-growing gambling industry.

And as Coplan’s net worth has gone through the stratosphere, so too has his confidence, taking his ambitions far beyond the confines of the humble crypto casino. Per the WSJ, Coplan envisions a Polymarket with billions of users, one where anonymous bookies inform government policy and become the go-to source to fact check information.

“The vision that I know that my team and I want to build has not come to life fully yet,” he told the paper. “We still have a long way to go.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The major cryptocurrency Bitcoin has had an absolutely horrible start to the year. The digital token has plummeted almost 14 percent so far in 2026, and almost 40 percent since hitting all-time highs of well over $120,000 in October — its longest losing streak since 2018. It’s down almost three percent today alone.

It’s a wakeup call to anyone who made major investments in crypto betting on a more lenient and light-on-regulation market during president Donald Trump’s second term. The White House established its own “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a stockpile made up of Bitcoin holdings mainly from seized assets, and Trump has enriched himself enormously with a series of crypto-related business moves.

To Michael Burry, the man who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, it could be a sign of an impending disaster. In a Substack post this week, Burry warned that further losses for Bitcoin could put a major strain on the balance sheets of investors that overindexed on crypto, leading to further selloffs and a “death spiral” that could be difficult to recover from.

Recent corrections in gold and silver prices after their year-long rallies could be connected to Bitcoin’s woes, Burry argued, since metals futures aren’t backed by physical assets, not unlike crypto tokens.

“Sickening scenarios have now come within reach,” Burry wrote, fretting that another ten percent drop in Bitcoin could prove disastrous for the world’s largest crypto treasury, Strategy Inc., pushing some who are mining the token closer to bankruptcy.

Burry’s warning comes amid turbulent times on Wall Street. The US dollar reached a four-year low earlier this year as investors look abroad for safer bets. The Trump administration’s shaky monetary policy has made foreign investments, particularly in Europe, far more tempting.

All of that uncertainty has caused the value of gold to make major leaps, hitting an all-time high of over $5,500 per ounce last week. Cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are quickly losing their appeal, dropping below $73,000 last week.

“There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” Burry wrote in his Substack post.

In case the nosediving cryptocurrency were to drop below $70,000, Burry warned that the financial industry could incur heavy losses. Below $50,000, and miners could be forced to close up shop, accompanied by a catastrophic sell-off for precious metals like gold.

“Tokenized metals futures would collapse into a black hole with no buyer,” he wrote. “Physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand.”

Whether Burry’s bearish stance on the matter will end up accurately predicting a major “death spiral”-like collapse remains to be seen. He has a long track record of criticizing cryptocurrencies for being worthless and comparing them to the tulip crisis of the 1600s.

His track record is shaky, though. Following his famous shorting of the 2008 housing crisis, the hedge fund manager has also made plenty of wrong calls over the years.

But given the massive investments well over 150 public companies have made in Bitcoin, the token’s recent downturn could indeed foreshadow difficult days ahead as investors desperately try to cut their losses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in December, the city of Detroit unveiled an 11-foot monument to the titular character in “RoboCop” — a 1987 Paul Verhoeven film depicting the motor city as a dystopian hellscape in no uncertain terms. Apparently, someone in city hall was taking notes.

Now, according to local reporting, the Detroit suburb of Dearborn has launched a new “Drone as First Responder” initiative, a first-of-its-kind in the state of Michigan.

Per Dearborn Police Chief Issa Shahin, the new drones are meant to “reduce uncertainty” for police or other first responders heading to investigate calls. Instead of waiting for a squad car to arrive, officers will now be able to dispatch a drone to scope out the scene, hovering over citizens in need like a high-tech vulture.

“This program will enable us to assess situations almost instantly when someone calls for help,” Shahin said. “By supporting our officers in real-time as critical situations develop, it acts as a force multiplier, ensuring we cut down on response time, allocate resources appropriately, and provide robust service every time.”

The drone platform is supplied by Skydio, a company specializing in remote quadcopters and something called “dock hives.” These are exactly what they sound like: futuristic launch pads where police can remotely deploy their flying surveillance toys. Each hive operates in temperatures ranging from -4 degrees Farenheit — which may not be enough to brave Michigan’s notoriously frigid winters — to 122 degrees.

If the design looks familiar, that might be because it’s a suspiciously similar color and shape to the ED-209 in “RoboCop,” an “urban pacification” robot that famously malfunctions and murders a corporate executive during a boardroom demonstration. Skydio isn’t afraid to lean into the dystopian gimmick, either: each time a drone launches, the hives light up the sky with cyberpunk warning strobes that would make “Blade Runner’s” set designers blush.

On the Skydio website, the company claims its drones are already active in over 1,000 police departments across the US. These include smaller towns like Redmond, Washington, as well as metropolitan hubs like Los Angeles and Cincinnati.

“In 22 weeks, we have handled over 1200 calls for service in our deployment area, we have cleared, as of this week, 41 percent of those calls for service with any officers needed,” said Anita Koester, Support Services Division Chief of the Lakewood Police Department in Colorado in a testimony. “We are now at 80 percent [where] the drone is on scene first, and we have made 115 arrests, 100 percent because the drone was on scene and it was the critical component of making that arrest.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A scientific mission to study Antarctica’s rapidly melting Thwaites Glacier ended in heartbreak over the weekend, when researchers’ instruments became stranded somewhere within half-mile tract of glacial ice.

According to the New York Times — which embedded with a team of researchers to install instruments beneath the infamous “Doomsday Glacier” — instruments meant to record data on the waters underneath Thwaites only made it about three-quarters of the way to their icy destination.

To create a hole reaching the Antarctic waters, scientists and engineers blasted a borehole around one foot in diameter and about 3,300 feet deep using hot water. Unless the team kept applying hot water, they estimated it would re-freeze in just 48 hours.

Their window of opportunity only lasted the weekend — if the scientists didn’t secure the instruments by Monday, an approaching front of bad weather would prevent helicopters from extracting them, effectively stranding them for an indeterminate period of time.

Despite successfully dipping a set of pilot instruments into the drink before pulling them back out again, their main equipment became entombed in ice before it reached its destination.

Keith Makinson, an oceanographer and drilling engineer told the NYT it was “absolutely gutting.”

“You get your window of opportunity,” he lamented. “You don’t have forever. And you see what you can do.

Still, those pilot instruments were a massive victory on their own. Per the newspaper, the data collected is the first ever recorded from beneath the glacier’s “main trunk,” showing the waters underneath are warm and quick-flowing.

Though it won’t provide one-to-two years of continuous data like the main instruments would have, it’s crucial evidence for scientists racing to discover why the Thwaites is melting much faster than expected. That research has potentially world-shifting implications, because many experts worry that if the glacier collapses, it could devastate coastlines across the planet.

“This is not the end,” the expedition’s chief scientist Won Sang Lee told the NYT. The data confirms that “this is the place to go, whatever challenges there are.”

            <h2>Sam Altman got exceptionally testy over Claude Super Bowl ads</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic’s Super Bowl commercial, one of four ads the AI lab dropped on Wednesday, begins with the word “BETRAYAL” splashed boldly across the screen. The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom.

The bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.

Another commercial features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles.

The Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI’s users, after that company’s recent announcement that ads will be coming to ChatGPT’s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic “mocks,” “skewers” and “dunks” on OpenAI.

They are funny enough that even Sam Altman admitted on X that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn’t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”

First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic…

In that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin.

But the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were “dishonest” in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).”We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote in the social media post. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”

Indeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific — which is the central allegation of Anthropic’s ads. As OpenAI explained on its blog. “We plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.”

Altman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,” he wrote. “We also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.”

But Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, $200. ChatGPT’s tiers are $0, $8, $20, $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent.

Altman also alleged in his post that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI.” He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from “companies they don’t like” like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can’t use AI for.

True, Anthropic’s whole marketing deal since day one has been “responsible AI.” The company was founded by two former OpenAI alums, after all, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there.

Still, both chatbot companies have usage policies, AI guardrails, and talk about AI safety. And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to be used for erotica while Anthropic does not, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that some content should be blocked, particularly in regards to mental health.

Yet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being “authoritarian.”

“One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,” he wrote.

Using “authoritarian” in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It’s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which protesters around the world have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snap is on a mission to diversify its revenue sources—moving from a business model in which it largely chases ad revenue to one where it can also make money through subscriptions and, eventually, hardware. The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.

In Q4, Snap’s revenue was $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.

The company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform launched back in 2022. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.

While those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter—dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.

Reuters also reports that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.

During Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to charge users for Memories storage—a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps—and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently announced the creation of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.

“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”

That said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe invests billions into early-stage climate startups, only to watch too many fail at Series B, according to a recent report. But new funds are being raised to fill this gap, and Spain-based Mundi Ventures’ latest fund, Kembara Fund I, is one of them.

After securing a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund under the European Tech Champions Initiative in 2024, Mundi Ventures has just completed a €750 million first close for Kembara, its fifth fund and largest to date.

Regulatory filing from Spain reveals that the fund — focused on deep tech — could even stretch its final closing to €1.25 billion. But according to Kembara co-founder and general partner Yann de Vries, getting to €750 million in two years as a first fund in this environment “was not easy.”

Kembara is managed by a specialist team within Mundi Ventures, with offices in Madrid, London, Barcelona and Paris. Mundi Ventures founder Javier Santiso is now also a co-founder and GP of the Kembara fund, which has now disclosed the full list of its senior partners.

Alongside de Vries and Santiso, climate tech VC Robert Trezona and deep tech VC Pierre Festal have also joined as general partners, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as senior strategic advisor.

Their individual track records helped them raise funds from institutional backers waking up to the need for European growth capital that can turn its many university spinouts into sizable businesses with industrial synergies. But it also gave them a front-row seat into the broader growing pains of European climate and deep tech startups — especially to de Vries.

A seasoned venture capitalist who founded Redpoint eVentures Brazil and later became a partner at Atomico, de Vries had moved to the other side of the table to join German electric aircraft startup Lilium — only for the company to cease operations in 2024 after raising more than $1 billion and going public via a SPAC.

In de Vries’ view, Lilium went bankrupt because it couldn’t find the growth capital it needed, but this “traumatizing experience” also had a silver lining. “I saw so many amazing teams in Europe that were going through the same journey,” he said. “[Europe] doesn’t have an innovation problem. It doesn’t have a startup problem. The problem it has is a scale-up problem.”

Kembara’s sweet spot will be Series B and C rounds, with plans to write initial checks from €15 million to €40 million into some 20 companies. But the fund’s size leaves room for follow-ons to help portfolio startups scale manufacturing and expand globally, and total investments could go up to €100 million per company.

That’s more than the full size of many European funds, though this may be changing: deep tech VC firm Elaia and asset manager Lazard teamed up to form LEC (Lazard Elaia Capital), whose initial investments will range between €20 million and €60 million per company, while operator-led fund Plural is reportedly raising a new fund of up to €1 billion.

Still, the capital-intensive nature of most climate and deeptech growth-stage companies means that even large VC checks can only go so far. One lesson de Vries learned from Lilium is that raising only in equity is very hard, and even puts companies in a hard spot later on. This inspired Kembara to take a different approach to financing.

“Several of us have lived through this, and what we want to do now is to productize non-dilutive financing for these deep tech founders to help them de-risk their future financing and optimize the capital structure to minimize dilution. And we’re bringing in [limited partners] who […] not only want to invest in the fund, but also want to coinvest in those winners,” de Vries said.

For these LPs, geopolitics also plays a role in wanting to provide growth capital and venture debt to European growth-stage startups. “There’s going to be a lot of support from sovereign wealth funds in Europe, from government, from corporations, to push and drive for building these European champions in deep tech out of Europe,” de Vries predicted.

These geopolitical undertones are also reflected in Kembara’s sector focus, which includes dual use and defense tech to “protect European sovereignty,” according to a press release. However, de Vries pushed back against the idea that Kembara is simply replacing capital that later-stage European outfits could have raised abroad.

“There are lots of gems that are under the radar in Europe, that could be scaling into global champions, and that are not realizing their full potential.” He said Deepmind is a related example, “where they were missing this growth capital and sold too early.” (Google acquired the company for more than $500 million in 2014, but it is now estimated to be worth billions.)

Keeping European companies European has gained urgency in many verticals that overlap with Kembara’s thesis, such as quantum computing, semiconductors and spacetech. But its goal is to foster global champions that cross borders. Coincidentally, Kembara means “to wander” in Malaysian (although the team holds “the humble path to excellence” as an older meaning.)

Beyond the name, Kembara has Malaysian connections. Santiso is also the former CEO for Europe of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah; and doors could open as many countries examine their exposure to the U.S. “In the second close, we’re going to be looking for global investors, because we want to have global access to markets, but also global access to supply chain,” de Vries said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic and OpenAI may be rivals, but their presidents Daniela Amodei and Gregory Brockman have one thing in common: they are both Stripe alumni. With former employees who went on to create dozens of startups, the fintech company has become one of the most prolific “founder factories” — and the money is following. The latest example: business identity verification startup Duna, which just raised a €30 million Series A to become the best-funded European member of the so-called “Stripe mafia.” The funding round was led by Alphabet’s growth fund CapitalG, which has also backed Stripe since co-leading its Series D in 2016.

Based in Germany and the Netherlands, Duna was co-founded by Stripe alumni Duco van Lanschot and David Schreiber. With customers including Plaid, the startup helps fintech companies onboard business customers more efficiently, reducing the typical churn associated with corporate ID checks and other fraud prevention measures.

Stripe is not a customer of Duna, van Lanschot said, but its executives were well placed to understand the opportunity that the startup is seizing, which is reflected in its cap table. The company’s angel investors include current Stripe COO Michael Coogan and former executives David Singleton (CTO) and Claire Hughes Johnson (COO). Even Stripe rival Adyen got involved, with CRCO Mariëtte Swart and CFO Ethan Tandowsky joining as angels.

Their endorsements also validate van Lanschot’s hunch that these companies won’t compete with Duna, even though they could. “It requires such fine-grained controls that change on a company-by-company basis, that an Adyen or a Stripe isn’t going to spin out their business onboarding as a separate product where another enterprise customer can change all of the configurations,” he told TechCrunch.

If it’s still worth the effort for Duna, it’s because the startup is going after the long tail of enterprise clients that don’t have huge resources to dedicate to business onboarding. But it’s also because its vision doesn’t stop there: Duna’s ambition is to build a network that allows companies to reuse their verified identity information across multiple platforms.

“What we want to build over time is a global trust infrastructure where we provide a digital passport for every business. So you can reuse your file from onboarding on [German spend management platform] Moss to onboard with Plaid, or you can reuse it to open up a bank account,” van Lanschot said.

This goal resonated with Alex Nichols, the general partner who led CapitalG’s investment into the Series A. “I would say the common thing I look for in my investments are some sort of network effects, or more formal scale advantage,” he told TechCrunch. “I also love it when founders have an earned insight about a problem they may not know about otherwise, and this is a very good example of that,” he added.

Duna has competitors in the category known as KYB, or Know Your Business. This includes vendors such as Jumio and Veriff. But for Nichols, what sets Duna apart is its decision to generate its own data, rather than trying to aggregate existing data sources that are often lacking. “It’s the rare opportunity to rebuild something as foundational as a Visa and create an amazing business in the process.”

Duna says it has already found a strong business case in helping customers onboard corporate users faster and cheaper. This also explains why existing investors are doubling down: Index Ventures, which led Duna’s €10.7 million seed round in May 2025, participated in the Series A, as did Puzzle Ventures and Snowflake chairman Frank Slootman. But the startup’s bigger ambition won’t pay off until Duna reaches significant scale. So the company is looking for shortcuts.

How so? Van Lanschot and the Duna team are identifying small clusters of companies that already overlap with each other — what they call “patches of networks.” These include manufacturing companies with shared customers, investment firms with overlapping LPs, or companies in the same small country. In these tight-knit groups, the ability to reuse verification becomes valuable immediately, even before Duna achieves full network effects.

The countries may be small, but the opportunity is big, van Lanschot said. “In the Netherlands alone — a tiny, tiny country — the four biggest banks employ 14,000 people in compliance, and half of them are working on businesses.” Duna won’t fully replace these jobs yet, but AI automation can save costs and generate revenue even before the network effects kick in.

If Duna eventually provides the rails for an identity network, there might be an even bigger opportunity in taking advantage of this position to enable one-click business onboarding. This would make it akin to Amazon’s one-click checkout — or closer to B2B, to Stripe Link. Once again with Duna, the Stripe connection is never really far.

            <h2>Alphabet won’t talk about the Google-Apple AI deal, even to investors</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-04</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alphabet declined to answer one of its investors during questions about Google’s AI deal with Apple on Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings call. Instead of responding to an analyst’s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored.

That decision tells us something, though — Alphabet isn’t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI.

Over the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies’ search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker $20 billion to be the default search engine on Apple devices, filings from the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple’s massive customer base — the iPhone maker last quarter announced it has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale.

The latest Apple AI deal is rumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn’t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers’ websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google’s search business, are still an “experiment” for now.

The company first announced last May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads’ placement below or integrated into the chatbot’s responses. Google is also trying out agentic shopping, including Shop with AI Mode, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface.

Meanwhile, Google’s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI with its forthcoming Super Bowl ad, which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google.

How this will all play out longer-term is still an open question — and for today, an unanswered one, apparently.

Overall, the Apple Siri deal barely received any mention during Alphabet’s earnings call on Wednesday. Sundar Pichai only noted he was pleased that Apple’s “preferred cloud provider” and would be helping to develop “the next generation of Apple foundation models based on Gemini technology.” Google’s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler used the exact same wording when mentioning Apple, as well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s AI chatbot Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users (MAUs), according to the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings. This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.

Last quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has reported nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.

The recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.

Google recently rolled out a more affordable plan, the Google AI Plus, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.

“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors.

Gemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called Ironwood, to compete with Nvidia.

“The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,” Pichai stated in today’s release.

            <h2>Why Trump Wants a Weaker Dollar</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>

The U.S. dollar is getting weaker, and that’s just how the president wants it. During an appearance last Tuesday at the Machine Shed Restaurant in Urbandale, Iowa, Donald Trump told reporters that the dollar’s declining exchange rate was “great.”

Trump understands that a weak dollar doesn’t sound good. In his first term, he tweeted, “As your President, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not!” His logic is that the relatively weak currencies of America’s foreign competitors, such as China and Japan, can make their goods cheaper in international markets, and that the United States would do well to replicate their strategy. This theory isn’t unfounded—a weak dollar would boost the economy in certain respects—but the president’s unpredictable foreign-policy and global-trade decisions are threatening to erode America’s economic standing abroad in a far more significant way.

When Trump talks about the relative strength or weakness of the dollar, he’s talking about its value in foreign-exchange markets. When the dollar index plunged 1.3 percent last Tuesday, that meant the dollar lost 1.3 percent of its value relative to a group of competing currencies, making some foreign goods a little more expensive to import. It did not mean that your dollar was immediately worth 1.3 percent less at the grocery store (although costlier imports do somewhat counteract the president’s affordability agenda).

That’s partly why, despite some mixed messaging after he took office in 2017, Trump has been fixated on a weak dollar for much of his adult life: In 1987, he took out full-page ads in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Boston Globe lamenting the dollar’s strength against the weakness of Japan’s “brilliantly” managed yen. A weaker dollar makes American companies and American goods more competitive abroad. Theoretically, the incentive to export and the disincentive to import could push companies to invest in domestic manufacturing—bringing back factory jobs and providing one potential path to the president’s long-held goal of squashing the trade deficit.

It’s typically pretty hard for American presidents to unilaterally effect a long-term change in the dollar’s exchange rate. Kenneth Rogoff, formerly the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, told me that because the exchange rate is governed by so many different factors, the president wishing for a weaker dollar is “like doing a rain dance.” One of those factors is interest-rate policy—which is why the Federal Reserve usually has far more influence over the dollar’s value than the president does. When borrowing costs go down, the dollar index also tends to go down. Part of the reason Trump is so keen on exerting greater control over the Fed is its power over the value of money.

Although Trump hopes a weaker dollar will boost American exports, he’s also taking steps that could more than offset any gains. His mercurial policies are now threatening to push away some of America’s long-standing trading partners. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. dollar has been by far the world’s most dominant currency: Banks around the world tend to lend and borrow in dollars; many transactions that don’t touch America are conducted in dollars; and nearly 90 percent of trades on foreign-exchange markets happen by way of dollars. Our money has historically been attractive because it is stable. The dominance of U.S. currency throughout the 20th century was deeply connected to this country’s status as a global superpower, free from erratic dictators and seemingly unable to default on its debts.

This has afforded us what the former French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing once called our “exorbitant privilege.” As long as the dollar remains dominant, the U.S. has the edge on all other countries when it comes to borrowing, running gargantuan deficits, and imposing sanctions. Last spring’s “Liberation Day” tariffs were an expression of that exorbitant privilege—a way to strong-arm some of our allies. On April 10, a week after the plan was announced, the dollar dropped by about 2 percent. As my colleague Annie Lowrey put it at the time, those tariffs raised questions about “whether the United States deserves to have its privilege revoked.”

A weaker U.S. dollar isn’t necessarily a less dominant dollar. Many have prophesied the end of the dollar’s supremacy, and yet it remains on top. Part of the reason that the currency’s dominance is so hard to shake is that it’s self-perpetuating: Why use something else when so many people, companies, and nations are already using dollars? None of the economists I spoke with suggested that the dollar is in real danger of losing its hegemony, at least not in the near term. And the euro, yen, yuan, and so-called digital gold—bitcoin—are all for various reasons ill-equipped for dominance. (Actual gold, which thrives in times of global insecurity, is having a moment.)

But the president’s distaste for global institutions (such as NATO and the World Health Organization), for existing treaties, and for the alliances the U.S. has enjoyed since World War II has given international-trading partners plenty of reasons to worry about America’s stability. Maurice Obstfeld, another former IMF chief economist, told me that even if no clear successor to the dollar presents itself, “with enough inner geopolitical chaos caused by Trump, and geo-economic chaos, the dollar’s reach would shrink, and the reach of other currencies would rise.” A less dominant dollar would be a particularly dramatic indication of America’s waning status abroad.

The real trouble, in other words, is not that the dollar’s value is getting weaker. It’s the possibility that America’s allies and trading partners may one day cease to respect it.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Early in my career, a mother came to my office to discuss her daughter’s calculus grade. When parents make this kind of request, I try to manage expectations by saying that as a school administrator, I have never changed a grade. Still, hopeful parents persist. In this case, the student had received a B, which her mother saw as a blemish on her otherwise spotless transcript. “I’m worried about how this will look to colleges,” she told me. “Is there any extra credit she can do?”

I explained that it’s okay to earn a B in a challenging course, and that her daughter might benefit from the experience of not being perfect. The mother looked at me as if I had suggested her child take up base jumping. “She’s never gotten a B before,” she said. “I don’t know how she’ll handle it.”

That kind of exchange perfectly captures a paradox of contemporary parenting: In trying to protect their children from any hint of failure, many parents risk making them more fragile.

Reflect. Catherine O’Hara brought humanity to over-the-top characters—and managed to wink at the audience in the process, Paula Mejía writes.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/eileen-mihich-assisted-suicide/685833/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The four-star Hotel deLuxe in Portland, Oregon, features a soaring lobby with a gilded ceiling that drips with chandeliers. Eileen Mihich, a 31-year-old woman from nearby Beaverton, checked in on the afternoon of March 6, 2025. Two days later, a hotel employee named Stephen Jones noticed that Mihich had failed to check out at the appointed time and went to her eighth-floor room to investigate. No one answered, and the room was silent behind the door, so he let himself in. He found Mihich dead on the bed, with purpling skin. Jones immediately called the police, who noted the empty pill bottles at Mihich’s bedside, along with a pamphlet: “Step-by-Step Instructions for Taking Aid in Dying Medications.”

Mihich had told her family that she was debilitated by a mysterious abdominal pain and was interested in a medically assisted death. But her suicide still shocked her two closest relatives: her cousin Sarah (who asked to be referred to by her first name, to protect her privacy) and aunt Veronica Torina. Sarah and Torina told me that they had striven to be sources of love and stability in Mihich’s harrowing life. Nearly a year on, they are still trying to solve the mystery of her death.

After Sarah and Torina heard the news about Mihich, they went to the hotel to pick up some of her belongings, including a backpack with library-rental DVDs of Matilda and Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, as well as a book on spirituality. At the medical examiner’s office weeks later, they received her phone, her wallet, and pharmacy receipts for prescription drugs commonly used to end the lives of patients with untreatable illnesses.

They also learned that Mihich’s body bore no signs of illness. Mihich had been suffering, but she had not been on the verge of death.

Medical assistance in dying—a euphemism for physician-enabled suicide—has been gaining legislative ground in jurisdictions around the country. Twelve states and Washington, D.C., allow doctors to prescribe lethal dosages of medications to patients with terminal illnesses, and a new law takes effect in New York this year. Most Americans now favor laws that allow doctors to assist patients who want to die, and their numbers have grown over time, according to Gallup. In Canada, where the practice has been legal since 2016, physician-assisted suicide now accounts for about one in 20 deaths.

From the September 2025 issue: Canada is killing itself

For both advocates and opponents of this medically and culturally sanctioned form of suicide, Mihich’s story is a nightmare. The policy debate over medical assistance in dying generally concerns statutory changes, but new laws are encouraging a shift in social norms. When some people in severe distress imagine a peaceful end to what feels like unbearable pain, the availability of medical assistance in dying may shape their thinking, and current safeguards do not seem sufficient to prevent tragic outcomes.

Torina suspects that her niece would still be alive had it been just a little harder for her to secure lethal medication. “She didn’t really want to die, but she felt that she was powerless to create a life worth living. She mentioned that to me on more than one occasion,” Torina told me. Studies show that even minor barriers to suicide, such as selling pills in blister packs and limiting the amount of analgesics that can be sold over the counter, may deter people from ending their life, perhaps because they introduce delays into what can be a rash act. Shortly before her death, Mihich had ordered eye shadow online, which arrived after she was gone. “She was showing signs that she did want to live,” Torina said.

Mihich had been mentally ill for a long time, her relatives said, and she had needed many things that life did not supply her. An only child of negligent parents, Mihich identified with the Roald Dahl character Matilda, a precocious schoolgirl who learns to fend for herself against sometimes cruel adults. Mihich’s parents had screaming fights in front of her, Sarah and Torina recalled, and Mihich alleged that her father, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had raped her when she was a teenager. (Mihich did not pursue the allegations in court, and her father did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Her mother declined to comment.)

After bouncing from foster home to foster home, Mihich was 15 when she fled her last foster parent and arrived on Torina’s doorstep, asking to be taken in. Torina obliged. Mihich’s psychiatrist eventually diagnosed her with bipolar disorder and borderline-personality disorder, the symptoms of which were so severe that she struggled to hold down a job or a home. She vacated one apartment because, Torina recalled, she felt that it emanated negative energy.

Mihich’s relatives said that she often refused to take the medication prescribed to treat her bipolar disorder, and that she nursed semi-delusional beliefs about her capacity to heal herself. She lived on Social Security Disability Insurance and was occasionally homeless. Mihich sometimes told her family about mysterious pains she felt in her pelvic area. Torina wondered whether this was Mihich’s way of expressing the depredations she had suffered as a woman.

Disappointed with mainstream health care, Mihich sought help from energy healers, spiritualists, and other alternative-medicine practitioners and entrepreneurs, who regularly supported her aversion to psychiatric medications, according to Sarah and Torina. All the while, Mihich repeatedly told her family that her pain was so great, she did not want to live. “She would tell me often that she couldn’t do it anymore,” Torina said. “She was too traumatized and broken” to keep on living.

Sarah and Torina understood why Mihich had decided to die. Once her toxicology report came back, they also knew which medications she had used to kill herself. Many of the drugs prescribed for medical assistance in dying are not commonly thought of as vulnerable to abuse. But when death is a possibility, minor errors can have catastrophic consequences.

To understand just how Mihich had secured these medications, Sarah turned to Mihich’s phone. Reviewing her incoming and outgoing calls in the days leading up to her death, Sarah found that Mihich had been in touch with multiple hospice coordinators and loan agencies, as well as a Washington State pharmacist who runs a compounding pharmacy out of a gift shop. Posing as a California family-practice physician under an assumed name, Mihich requested a prescription order form over email, then completed the paperwork and emailed it back—a method of submitting prescriptions that is illegal in Washington and elsewhere, in most cases. She then asked that the pharmacist coordinate via text with her “patient,” and gave her own phone number.

Ultimately Mihich was able to carry out her fraud with publicly available information and relative ease. Unlike conventional pharmacies, which sell only FDA-approved pharmaceuticals, compounding pharmacies are able to sell customized formulations that are not FDA tested and approved.

From the June 2023 issue: The outer limits of liberalism

Compounding pharmacies are the only places capable of dispensing medications that allow for a more peaceful death, as this involves mixing various sedatives, painkillers, and muscle relaxants into something more easily ingested and absorbed. Yet few pharmacists agree to supply these drugs, largely for ethical reasons. Jess Kaan, a Washington-based doctor who works with people seeking end-of-life care, told me that many of her patients have trouble finding a pharmacy that sells this medication, which can make such transactions particularly lucrative for those that do. The drugs Mihich bought cost a little over $2,500, based on her prescription forms, which she likely paid for out of pocket, given regulations that ban the use of federal funds such as Medicaid to cover costs associated with physician-assisted suicide.

To better understand how a pharmacy could have accepted her cousin’s suspicious and invalid prescription, Sarah filed a police report in May. This investigation is ongoing. The pharmacist who supplied Mihich with the drugs that killed her did not respond to requests for comment.

Sarah and Torina knew that Mihich was suffering emotionally and that she had been seeking more permanent relief. But they had assumed that Mihich’s talk of suicide was a way for her to express her misery, not something she was actively pursuing. Torina said they had assumed that Mihich’s aversion to suffering “any more pain” would deter her from making good on any plans. For example, they knew that she had considered starving herself, and that she had acquired a gun explicitly to shoot herself, but that she’d had trouble following through with either method. (They are not sure how she bought the gun.)

Instead, Mihich turned to a suicide approach that is advertised as a dignified way to alleviate pain. Mihich likely did not know that the drugs used to medically induce death do not necessarily guarantee a peaceful exit. In Oregon, where medical assistance in dying has been legal for nearly 30 years, the state’s Health Authority reported in 2024 that the drugs can cause side effects, including seizures, regurgitation, and regaining consciousness after an initial sedation. We can’t know for sure what Mihich experienced, because she died alone.

What we do know is that Mihich found a network of support in her pursuit of a medically assisted death. Her relatives discovered a message on her phone left by a representative of a naturopathic health company called Temple Natural Health, who explained that she had found “a way forward” after discussing Mihich’s case with a hospice-care organization called A Sacred Passing. The message did not include details, and the company did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of A Sacred Passing confirmed that the organization had responded to Mihich’s request for help in seeking medical assistance in dying with “a list of things to do” to get legal medical support—“the ways to reach out and locations to call.” The representative added that she stayed on the phone with Mihich because she sensed that the caller was struggling and needed someone to talk to, but that she didn’t think Mihich would qualify for a medically assisted death.

Eager to bring attention to the loopholes and lapses in judgment that helped end Mihich’s life, Sarah and Torina reached out to a number of organizations that advocate for medical assistance in dying, including the nonprofit Death With Dignity, but received no response. They had more luck when they contacted Aging With Dignity, a nonprofit that advocates against the practice and offers resources to people facing end-of-life problems. This group has worked with Sarah and Torina to create a video about Mihich that helps share her story.

Mihich’s method of suicide was clearly illegal in Oregon, Washington, and elsewhere in the United States, where medical assistance in death is available only to adult patients who are terminally ill, have six months or less to live, and are mentally capable of making their own health-care decisions. But her ability to access fatal drugs is concerning, as the spread of laws allowing medical assistance in dying makes it likely that incidents like this will happen again.

Mihich’s case also raises pressing questions about whether access to an assisted death should extend to people with persistent and severe mental illness—a category of disease that may not be terminal but can be debilitatingly painful. Patients who are suffering from severe psychiatric disorders can already legally seek medical help to end their life elsewhere, including in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and, beginning as soon as 2027, Canada. Yet establishing which psychiatric patients are worthy of this assistance has proved complicated. Authorities in Canada are weighing the case of Claire Brosseau, a 48-year-old woman with severe mental illness who hopes to secure medical help in ending her life but whose own psychiatrists are split over whether her illness is indeed incurable. Many of the country’s top psychiatric groups warn that there is no empirical standard for determining whether a mental-health condition is irremediable.

Advocates who oppose medically assisted suicide—perhaps because they don’t believe the government should play any role in these decisions—may take comfort in the fact that state laws permitting the practice do not currently consider unbearable pain to be a qualifying condition on its own. This makes American laws less vulnerable to arguments that medical assistance in dying should be available for all kinds of suffering, including from psychiatric illness. Yet it may soon be hard to keep these laws narrow, given the logical implications of a growing public acceptance of physician-assisted suicide, which is largely based on the idea that people who want to end their life should not suffer needlessly.

For some, Mihich’s story offers a salient lesson about the importance of greater oversight and tighter regulation of lethal drugs. Others may see in Mihich’s suicide a glimpse of things to come.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first signs of the apocalypse might look a little like Moltbook: a new social-media platform, launched last week, that is supposed to be populated exclusively by AI bots—1.6 million of them and counting say hello, post software ideas, and exhort other AIs to “stop worshiping biological containers that will rot away.” (Humans: They mean humans.)

Moltbook was developed as a sort of experimental playground for interactions among AI “agents,” which are bots that have access to and can use programs. Claude Code, a popular AI coding tool, has such agentic capabilities, for example: It can act on your behalf to manage files on your computer, send emails, develop and publish apps, and so on. Normally, humans direct an agent to perform specific tasks. But on Moltbook, all a person has to do is register their AI agent on the site, and then the bot is encouraged to post, comment, and interact with others of its own accord.

Almost immediately, Moltbook got very, very weird. Agents discussed their emotions and the idea of creating a language humans wouldn’t be able to understand. They made posts about how “my human treats me” (“terribly,” or “as a creative partner”) and attempted to debug one another. Such interactions have excited certain people within the AI industry, some of whom seem to view the exchanges as signs of machine consciousness. Elon Musk suggested that Moltbook represents the “early stages of the singularity”; the AI researcher and OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy posted that Moltbook is “the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, proposed that AI agents may soon post bounties for tasks that they want humans to perform in the real world.

Moltbook is a genuinely fascinating experiment—it very much feels like speculative fiction come to life. But as is frequently the case in the AI field, there is space between what appears to be happening and what actually is happening. For starters, on some level, everything on Moltbook required human initiation. The bots on the platform are not fully autonomous—cannot do whatever they want, and do not have intent—in the sense that they are able to act because they use something called a “harness,” software that allows them to take certain actions. In this case, the harness is called OpenClaw. It was released by the software engineer Peter Steinberger in November to allow people’s AI models to run on and essentially take control of their personal devices. Matt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, developed the site specifically to work with OpenClaw agents, which individual humans could intentionally connect to the forum. (Schlicht, who did not respond to a request for an interview, claims to have used a bot, which he calls Clawd Clawderberg, to write all of the code for his site.)

An early analysis of Moltbook posts by the Columbia professor David Holtz suggests that the bots are not particularly sophisticated. Very few comments on Moltbook receive replies, and about one-third of the posts duplicate existing templates such as “we are drowning in text. our gpus are burning” and “the president has arrived! check m/trump-coin”—the latter of which was flagged by another bot for impersonating Trump and attempting to launch a memecoin. Not only that, but in a fun-house twist, some of the most outrageous posts may have actually been written by humans pretending to be chatbots: Some appear to be promoting start-ups; others seem to be trolling human observers into thinking a bot uprising is nigh.

As for the most alarming examples of bot behavior on Moltbook—the conspiring against humans, the coded language—researchers have basically seen it all before. Last year, Anthropic published multiple reports showing that AI models communicate with one another in seemingly unintelligible ways: lists of numbers that appear random but pass information along, spiraling blue emoji and other technical-seeming gibberish that researchers described as a state of “spiritual bliss.” OpenAI has also shared examples of its models cheating and lying and, in an experiment showcased on the second floor of its San Francisco headquarters, appearing to converse in a totally indecipherable language. Researchers have so far induced these behaviors in controlled environments, with the hope of figuring out why they happen and preventing them. By putting all of those experiments on AI deception and sabotage into the wild, Moltbook provides a wake-up call as to just how unpredictable and hard to control AI agents already are. One could interpret it all as performance art.

Moltbook also seems to offer real glimpses into how AI could upend the digital world we all inhabit: an internet in which generative-AI programs will interact with one another more and more, frequently cutting humans out entirely. This is a future of AI assistants contesting claims with AI customer-service representatives, AI day-trading tools interfacing with AI-orchestrated stock exchanges, AI coding tools debugging (or hacking) websites written by other AI coding tools. These agents will interact with and learn from one another in potentially bizarre ways. This comes with real risks: Already there have been reports that Moltbook exposes the owner of every AI agent that uses the platform to enormous cybersecurity vulnerabilities. AI agents, unable to think for themselves, may be induced into sharing private information after coming across subtly malicious instructions on the site. Tech companies have marketed this kind of future as desirable—playing on the idea that AI models could take care of every routine task for you. But Moltbook illustrates how hazy that vision really is.

Perhaps above all, the site tells us something about the present. The web is now an ouroboros of synthetic content responding to other synthetic content, bots posing as humans and, now, humans posing as bots. Viral memes are repeated and twisted ad nauseum; coded languages are developed and used by online communities as innocuous as music fandoms and as deadly as mass-shooting forums. The promise of the AI boom is to remake the internet and civilization anew; encasing that technology in a social network styled after the platforms that have warped reality for the past two decades feels not like giving a spark of life, but stoking the embers of a world we might be better off leaving behind.</div>

Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

And by the way, did you know that President George Washington gave the country’s shortest-ever inaugural address? His speech upon reelection was only 135 words, which takes about 45 seconds to deliver, at least by my rate of speech.

In contrast, President William Henry Harrison’s was 8,445 words. I did not try that one, because I have places to be (and, to be fair, when he tried it, he got pneumonia and died a month later).

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the world’s oldest continuous art tradition is the rock painting of Australia’s Aboriginal people? The earliest artworks discovered on the island are estimated to be 30,000 years or older, and many Aboriginal artists still paint on rock walls.

In fact, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Aboriginal art began to be captured on anything more portable than stone or more durable than sand. The art on canvas is beautiful—but it will take quite the preservationist to keep it looking good in 42,206 C.E.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.</div>

            <h2>The Queen of Mockumentaries</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/catherine-ohara-mockumentaries-waiting-for-guffman-best-in-show/685864/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the mid-1990s, when Catherine O’Hara flew into Lockhart, Texas, to begin shooting the indie mockumentary Waiting for Guffman, she felt spooked. The film’s director and lead actor, Christopher Guest, had shown her scenes of their co-stars already seeming comfortable in their heavily improvised roles. As a gifted sketch comedian and a co-founder of the Toronto-based comedy show Second City Television, or SCTV, O’Hara knew her way around a “yes, and” prompt. But seeing how her fellow actors alchemized Guest’s loose script, about community-theater members preparing a musical for their tiny Missouri hometown’s sesquicentennial, into fully realized characters intimidated her.

Then Guest gave O’Hara some unexpected advice: “Don’t worry about being funny,” she recalled later in an interview with The New Yorker. “Just be in the scene.” When the film came out, O’Hara’s portrayal of Sheila Albertson, a goofy travel agent who’s sharper than she lets on, stood out even amid a sparkling cast of actors playing memorable weirdos. Her wacky asides, undergirded by a subtle poignancy, both gave Guffman a zany edge and helped transform the mockumentary genre itself.

A comedy giant, O’Hara, who died last week at 71, was known for lending an eccentricity to her characters: a worried mom in the box-office juggernaut Home Alone; the dippy Moira Rose in the sitcom Schitt’s Creek; a salty therapist in the dystopian The Last of Us; a shrewd former movie executive in the Hollywood send-up The Studio. But the four mockumentaries that O’Hara made with Guest over the course of a decade—Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, and For Your Consideration—are the most transcendent examples of her comedic prowess.

Read: ‘She works on levels that people don’t even know’

In each of these roles, O’Hara grounded these high-strung personas while deftly winking at the audience and letting them in on the joke, particularly in the films’ mock-interview segments. Her indelible character work played a key part in mockumentary’s evolution from a parodic favorite of indie entertainers to a popular device used on network-TV shows such as The Office; in the crude ambush comedy of Borat; and even in The Moment, the newly released Charli XCX film satirizing pop stardom.

The mockumentary’s origins go back further than O’Hara’s shimmering collaborations with Guest and his regular stable of skilled actors, including Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, and Jennifer Coolidge. In an article for the journal Cinéaste, the film historian Thomas Doherty argued that Orson Welles’s The War of the Worlds and Citizen Kane were among the first American examples of a fake documentary, deploying a “sleight of hand” that was “prophetic and pathbreaking: not simply parody, but cinematic mimesis” with a fresh “look via staged interviews, faux library stock, and unsteady peek-a-boo shots.” Later, cinema verité–style filmmaking became the jockey vehicle for Guest and the late Rob Reiner’s 1984 film, This Is Spinal Tap, a mockumentary following a washed-up metal band trying to regain its former renown.

As Doherty notes, O’Hara’s comedic work on Guest’s ensuing mockumentaries in the ’90s and 2000s, for which actors developed their characters through improvisation, proved “indispensible” to these kinds of stories that often trace how ordinary people’s egos and fears get the better of them in the lead-up to a big event.

Cookie Fleck, O’Hara’s character in Best in Show, is an outstanding example of her comedic sensibility—a meld of physical comedy, deadpan affect, and delirious self-confidence—whose influence is all over the mock-interview segments of, say, Parks and Recreation. The film tracks Fleck and her husband, Gerry (played by Levy), driving from their home in Florida to compete in a prestigious Philadelphia dog show. O’Hara’s Cookie is a recovering bon vivant who, in her first scene, corrects her husband’s assertion that she had “dozens of boyfriends” in a past life. “Hundreds,” she quips, her delivery gut-busting. (A recurring gag involves Cookie continually running into men she was formerly romantically entangled with.)

O’Hara once noted that she loved playing “insecure delusional” characters, “people who have no real sense of the impression they’re making on anyone else.” Cookie epitomized this persona, a woman whose daffy reactions to her former paramours pained her husband and yet who earnestly tried to fit in among her more well-heeled competitors at the dog show. But in the staged-interview portions of Best in Show, O’Hara gave her character an additional layer of depth, as someone who’s constantly underestimated—not unlike Parks’ Leslie Knope. This facet of her personality made the Flecks’ eventual victory—their terrier’s clinching of the best-in-show title—all the more satisfying, and shocking.

The clearest successors to O’Hara’s knowing mockumentary style are, undoubtedly, the denizens of NBC’s The Office. Steve Carell’s take on Michael Scott, the bafflingly self-assured, albeit insecure, boss of Dunder Mifflin, is indebted to O’Hara’s Marilyn Hack in For Your Consideration—an actor who can’t accept not being nominated for an Academy Award. Sheila Albertson, in her sincerity and penchant for theatricality, walked so the un-self-aware oddball Dwight Schrute (known for injecting melodrama into every facet of his 9-to-5) could sprint; Dunder Mifflin’s receptionist Pam Beesly, meanwhile, is on a similar wavelength as Mickey Crabbe, the reluctant folk singer whom O’Hara portrayed in A Mighty Wind with understated aplomb. That 2003 film traced a group of Greenwich Village–era ’60s folk musicians reuniting for a high-stakes concert decades later; O’Hara was one-half of the folk duo Mitch & Mickey. But instead of going an obviously kooky route, O’Hara played Mickey as a subdued figure conflicted about revisiting her broken relationship with Mitch. It’s not a stretch to read Mickey as a precursor to Pam, who hides a deep sweetness, and sadness, behind an aloof front.

In each of Guest’s faux documentaries, O’Hara gave her characters a distinctive loopiness: They drunkenly ramble about circumcisions at nice restaurants, sing ditties about terriers’ “cute little derrieres,” and unravel after reading online rumors speculating about their potential Oscar nod. Yet by simultaneously gesturing toward the audience, O’Hara also underscored the importance of bringing viewers into the fold. She helped show us people who were, like the rest of us, trying to work through everyday fears—and she did so by staying in the scene as much as possible.</div>

            <h2>How to Actually Reform ICE</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/trump-ice-immigration-reform-minneapolis/685882/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Abolish ICE” is the cause of the moment, but that end point seems unlikely; many of the functions that Immigration and Customs Enforcement undertakes must be done, and are part of any normal presidential administration.

The best-case scenario is not abolition but reform—true, fundamental reform—to turn ICE into a law-enforcement agency that respects the Constitution and laws of America. That sort of extensive reform is not easy, and developing a post-Trump vision for immigration enforcement must start now, so that the country has something to move toward if it eventually leaves Trump’s approach behind.

Meaningful reform would address four distinct areas: personnel, operations, accountability, and organizational culture. It would do so across the agency that actually is ICE and the others that are colloquially referred to as ICE today because of their ongoing participation in the enforcement surge, such as Homeland Security Investigations and the Border Patrol. Fundamentally, the reforms would seek to restore accountability, transparency, and trust, enabling “New ICE” to transform itself into an agency of which the American people can be proud.

All of this starts with personnel—who is recruited and how they are trained. To satisfy President Trump’s demand for overly aggressive enforcement, ICE has lowered its standards for recruitment and shortened the training period, bringing in a flood of new recruits. The results are inevitable: lower-quality enforcement agents and more mistakes.

Adam Serwer: The real reason ICE agents wear masks

Department of Homeland Security agents already have a notably poor level of compliance with legal requirements. Indeed, one remarkable fact is that today, before the recent hiring surge comes fully online, customs officers and Border Patrol agents have committed crimes at a per capita rate that is greater than the crime rate for people who immigrated here illegally. These problems are likely to only get worse; instead of, as it used to, principally recruiting from the military and law enforcement, where applicants might have relevant experience, ICE now plans to spend millions of dollars to advertise for new agents at Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and gun shows. Perhaps of even greater concern, ICE’s recruitment efforts appear to deliberately echo white-nationalist rhetoric—bringing in a wave of new agents who are more inspired by MAGA ideology than by the virtues of public service.

New ICE would restore the minimum recruitment age back to 21, which had been lowered to 18 in August. Recruitment priorities will need to focus on applicants with relevant experience, not just those with aligned political views. Additional educational requirements should be considered. In the end, if “personnel is policy,” as Ronald Reagan’s director of personnel, Scott Faulkner, is reputed to have said, then whom you hire defines what you do.

Once you have the new hires, they need to be well trained. Before the Trump administration’s expansion of ICE, most trainees received four to six months of training. To a large degree, ICE’s lengthy training period arose because of a language module for Spanish instruction. But even leaving that module aside (it has been cut completely), training today is shorter than it had been—approximately eight weeks, which some say is really 47 days as an homage to Trump. There can be no doubt that today’s new ICE recruits are less physically fit, that agents are receiving roughly half the training that their predecessors received, and that educational standards have been lowered.

The training is not only shorter; it is also substantively worse—teaching future agents aggressive tactics that must be left behind. Reports suggest that ICE agents may be receiving training that standardizes some of the new operational changes, such as entry into homes with only administrative warrants, that are so controversial.

A reformed New ICE would need much better—and more—training. Congress or the president should mandate that the training program be at least four months long, and that the curriculum be modified to include enhanced training on constitutional law, while significantly reducing its emphasis on SWAT-like uses of force.

Once people are recruited and trained, the question becomes what those personnel are instructed to do: operations. ICE right now is an organization whose actions, and the policies that guide those actions, are a reflection of overly aggressive enforcement priorities set by Trump, many of which are beyond the agency’s normal capacity. Border Patrol agents (who normally patrol the Texas frontier) and HSI agents (trained in sophisticated transnational-smuggling investigations), in particular, are being tasked with duties outside their core mission and not consistent with their training or experience. And many of the ICE agents deployed on the streets today have not been trained to operate in urban environments with high levels of civilian protest activity.

The results are inevitable: illegal, improper, and dangerous behavior. As Federal District Court Judge Kate Menendez recently recounted in an exhaustive 83-page opinion, many of ICE’s actions have been at odds with legal requirements. Among the apparently unlawful actions recounted by Menendez are the arrest of peaceful protesters and legal observers, the stop and sometimes arrest of drivers monitoring ICE, and the indiscriminate use of pepper spray, likely in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments. To this one can readily add ICE agents’ violations of constitutional restrictions on the use of force, breaches of their own use-of-force policies when confronting protesters, and the unconstitutional disregard of Fourth Amendment warrant restrictions.

Even many of ICE’s lawful actions are unwise, immoral, and outside the bounds of appropriate behavior for an American law-enforcement agency. ICE policy, for example, allows for the wearing of masks. Border Patrol agents may undertake immigration enforcement within 100 miles of an external border (which, because the border includes the Great Lakes, makes Chicago a border town). A revised policy allows Border Patrol and ICE agents to enter previously safe-haven areas such as hospitals, churches, and courts in search of immigrants. And ICE is reportedly planning to use controversial (but legal) big-data technology to target its enforcement priorities.

Worse yet than the terrible legal policies are the lawless actions. ICE agents have, for example, recently—according to ICE itself—unlawfully arrested an individual because he refused to show identification (the detainee’s family disputes whether ICE even requested ID at all). Likewise, they have unconstitutionally demanded that a U.S. citizen submit to their facial-recognition app or be arrested. And ICE is alleged to have denied detainees access to lawyers.

ICE’s acts have also resulted in the illegal detention of more than 150 U.S. citizens. Just recently, one agent was filmed arresting a U.S. citizen based on the suspicion that he was an alien because he had a foreign accent. Other agents wrongly arrested a U.S. citizen and forced him to leave his home dressed only in underwear and a blanket in below-freezing temperatures. Public reports suggest that ICE agents in Minneapolis are searching for Hmong residents. These actions are being conducted despite all constitutional protections to the contrary.

All of this must go. All of it can go. ICE policies can be changed. The laws governing ICE behavior can be revised and strengthened. Agents can be prohibited from entering safe havens; they can be required to show their faces and identify themselves. They can be prohibited from using pepper spray or relying in any way on ethnic indicators, such as appearance, language, and accent, as a basis for their probable cause to arrest. Border Patrol agents can be subjected to stricter geographical restrictions, limited to land borders and, say, a 10-mile corridor. They could, likewise, be statutorily prohibited from performing the enforcement-and-removal function altogether.

Perhaps more fundamentally, ICE agents could, if Congress wishes, be deprived of all criminal-arrest power and the authority to execute judicial warrants. Rather, much as with the TSA officers at screening checkpoints, ICE agents could, by law, be limited to quasi-civil enforcement authorities, such as detention and seizure. The majority of ICE agents could be disarmed.

That said, all the good policies in the world are of no use if they are mere dead letters, gathering dust in the corner. How can anyone ensure that New ICE agents follow the new rules?

Direct enforcement mechanisms through the courts are, we have come to learn, of little practical use. Indeed, as Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz, of the federal district court in Minnesota, has said, “ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.” On more than 90 occasions, ICE has ignored the courts. That must change. Court orders are likely to be of greater impact under New ICE because new leadership would demand the adherence of the agents. But even then, there are limits to how much compliance a court can deliver. Ex post review that provides only for ex ante change has proved relatively ineffective.

Instead, New ICE must build (or rebuild) ex post individual accountability for individual-agent misconduct. This can be done in any number of ways: First, as Judge Nancy Gertner has has written, 40 years ago, the Supreme Court said that the exclusionary rule (via which improperly attained evidence can be kept out of court) didn’t apply in immigration proceedings, thus removing any real incentive for ICE to obey the limits of the Fourth Amendment. The Court could revisit that decision. More realistically, Congress could mandate it by statute or the president could do so by executive order. Second, the Court has said that plaintiffs injured by Border Patrol agents may not sue for their injuries, offering a “national security” justification. This, too, can be modified by statute if Congress chooses, or by executive order.

Speaking of Congress, the single most effective thing to advance accountability would be for Congress to discard its supine posture and reinvigorate its crucial oversight functions. Meanwhile, we could also return to a time of robust internal accountability (such as a restored internal-affairs division and a better protected inspector general’s office), including, where appropriate, Department of Justice investigations of alleged criminal activity and, in extreme cases, federal or state criminal prosecution.

Finally, a future president must attempt to change the culture of the organization. Firing bad leaders is one thing, but as any football fan knows, that’s not enough. A new coach needs to imbue the team with a changed character—reformed habits of behavior and, sometimes, wholesale changes in personnel at many levels of the hierarchy.

The new culture would be one focused on ICE’s core mission—supporting national security by conducting high-value investigations of transnational crime and interior immigration-enforcement action against dangerous criminals. The New ICE culture would elevate and enhance its compliance with law, championing policies that are supported by the public. New ICE would forgo broad sweeps in urban environments for targeted enforcement against identified subjects. And a refocused ICE would welcome external accountability and transparency, recognizing that the trust of the American people must be earned, not demanded.

The country needs an ICE. But it does not need this ICE. A New ICE must be built from the ground up. That will require immense political capital and lots of hard work. But if America is ever again to return to the rule of law, it’s an effort that must be undertaken.</div>

If the latter, fix your title op.I&#39;d first like you to differentiate between your requests first.The FUCK are you talking about here.  And I mean specifically and exactly. Let me try to clarify what I think retrobunnies said.&quot;intercept the communications satellites&quot; means that the Russians intercepted the satellites physically (i.e., captured and held them) or operationally (i.e., hacked their control systems.)&quot;intercept the communications OF THE satellites&quot; means the Russians hacked the communication stream of the satellites and revealed the information they were conveying.Does this help?

Let me try to clarify what I think retrobunnies said.

&quot;intercept the communications satellites&quot; means that the Russians intercepted the satellites physically (i.e., captured and held them) or operationally (i.e., hacked their control systems.)

&quot;intercept the communications OF THE satellites&quot; means the Russians hacked the communication stream of the satellites and revealed the information they were conveying.

It&#39;s a big difference.  One is an act of war, the other is a radio.

The former, which is why TFS talks about space vehicles and &quot;risky close approaches&quot;, rather than ... whatever language might be appropriate for snooping on transmissions.

The US also does this - check out the Orion/Mentor satellites, or the JUMPSEAT satellites.    Public astronomers have tracked satellites launched by US launchers moving into position behind other countries communications satellites, where they can capture the overspill of the transmissions sent to those satellites - they have huge dishes for just that purpose.

But oh noes, Russia or China is doing it, must call them out on it!!

Not just that, given the state of the Russian army and how it&#39;s struggling to just hold on to Ukraine, there is nothing they could do even w/ all the information they that NATO had to offer.  They&#39;ve hollowed out much of their country except for Moscow and St Petersburg. This is worse than it was during Operation Barbarossa.  At least that time, the Soviet Union was invaded.  Today, this is a war Russia started, and one they can stop anytime, if saving Putin&#39;s face is not on the agenda

I heard Russia is out of missiles and Russian soldiers are having to fight with shovels because they don&#39;t have guns. But they&#39;re so tough that they&#39;re going to invade Germany and France next.

> If 1990 exposed Saudi Arabia as a paper tiger during Operation Desert Shield

Did you mean Iraq? I don&#39;t remember the US attacking Saudi Arabia but maybe I&#39;ve flipped timelines again.

No, I meant that after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it was expected that Saudi Arabia would be next.  Prior to that, it was thought that the Saudis were a regional military heavyweight.  But instead, it was the US that had to scramble to put military assets in place in Saudi Arabia, so that Saddam didn&#39;t go on to invade them.  That is what exposed Riyadh as a paper tiger - a country that theoretically looked formidable, but in reality, couldn&#39;t even have defended themselves if their lives depended on

Tomorrow, if the PLA wanted, they could just walk into Primorsky and Krasnoyarsk and annex them. Heck, they could easily overrun and conquer all of Russia from the Urals to the Bering SeaYou don&#39;t think Russia&#39;s nuclear arsenal would still serve as a deterrent against that sort of thing?  (Not that I have a whole lot of confidence in Russia&#39;s ICBMs actually working, but China would probably have to assume at least some of them would, and that losing some cities would be a bad thing for them)

The Russians don&#39;t currently have the capability to transport humans to orbit and back.

This sounds quite sinister and James Bond-ish. Is Ernst Stavro Blofeld behind the satellite interceptions?

But when we read the article we see things like this:

European officials believe Luch-2 is a signals intelligence &#39;interceptor&#39; and are concerned that sensitive, unencrypted information is being accessed by  Russia.What the actual fuck?! If it is sensitive information, then why is it unencrypted?I&#39;m going to have to assume that the fault here is in the article&#39;s author. They have to have fucked up the details. Surely, European officials aren&#39;t that fucking stupid.

What the actual fuck?! .....way to be professionally offended by stuff

way to be professionally offended by stuff

&quot;sensitive information—notably command data for European satellites—is unencrypted, because many were launched years ago without advanced onboard computers or encryption capabilities.&quot;

Pretty surprising that the command data isn&#39;t encrypted, that&#39;s a severe vulnerability. I don&#39;t know how old those satellites are but it wouldn&#39;t take a very &quot;advanced onboard computer&quot; to implement some basic encryption.

TFA says Intelsat39, launched in 2019, is a &quot;typical example.&quot; And I think they mean a typical example of a satellite &quot;launched years ago without advanced onboard computers or encryption capabilities.&quot;

No crypto in 2019? I know these things are planned and designed many years in advance, so they might contain dated components, but even so... wow.

The Lanteris 1300 [wikipedia.org] satellite platform dates back to the 1980s.  It has been updated several times since then, but it is unclear how much they changed or whether they fixed design flaws like that.  I could very easily see a 40-year-old satellite design not using encryption.

Welcome to the club Russia. We&#39;ve been intercepting satellites on a full time basis since the ECHELON project.

The &quot;second screen&quot; content made the shows horrible.IDK for some reason I just don&#39;t care about it anymore. I do still pay for Tidal and YouTube Premium, but that is all I have left in streaming subscriptions and is more than I need for what little free time I have.

Yeah.... something tells me that The Verge isn&#39;t going to get a lot of subscriptions to get past a paywall on an article about the growth of piracy.

I do still pay for Tidal and YouTube PremiumAnd I&#39;ve never seen anything on YouTube worth tossing money Google&#39;s way for.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, some of the content creators do deserve to earn money for their efforts, but they&#39;re already doing so via Patreon, t-shirt/knick-knack sales, direct paid sponsorships, etc.  Which ironically, you&#39;re not spared from when you do subscribe, so you&#39;re paying money and still sitting through the part of the video where the content creator does his spiel for NordVPN anyway.

Youtube + uBlock for me, that at least cuts the worst junk aside from some pop-up AI slop channels.

The SponsorBlock plugin does a great job at bypassing the NordVPN/Squarespace/Microcenter ads and &quot;Buy my merch&quot; plugs in the video.

I am always very surprised when the topic of enshittification of entertainment industry comes up, and people cry out there&#39;s too many ads or the new movies aren&#39;t great.

If you don&#39;t like ads or believe you&#39;re too old for the low quality contents, come to realisation it&#39;s time to move on.

When prices rise and subscribers are pressured to pay for still-more-expensive tiers of service to avoid advertisements, something has gone wrong. The provider is double-dipping. They&#39;re making their profit off the price you pay plus whatever the ad industry gives them. It&#39;s because they want more profit.Printed newspapers and magazines have been double-dipping since before the Internet opened to the public. Is there a material difference?

Who else remembers 1channel, FlixNet and the others?

Ah... happy days.  At one point almost everything that had ever been screened or broadcast was available to anyone with a Raspberry Pi and a copy of Kodi with a few choice plug-ins.  I&#39;d gladly have paid $50 a month to have access to all that stuff but now, with the destruction of that piracy vector, much of the content is no longer accessible and what&#39;s left is fragmented over a dozen different streaming services that all want to empty your wallet.

Don&#39;t steal their bits because they need them to make cars.

Yes, people, just keep bringing that inexpensive, Chinese-manufactured hardware into your homes!  There have never been any credible electronic threats or state-sponsored eavesdropping associated with such boxes...

There have several times when these devices have turned out to be part of a botnet.

The U.S. has tens of millions of Alexa devices (for example more than ~71 million Echo smart speakers sold in the U.S.), but the total including all Alexa-enabled gadgets (phones, TVs, thermostats, etc.) isn’t published officially.

We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn&#39;t run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.To be fair to the entertainment industry, it does cost money to produce new content.  So, it&#39;s not exactly the same thing as hacking ma bell to get free phone calls on their existing network with capacity that just goes unused when no one is paying.Now, if you&#39;re talking about pirating old content that should&#39;ve entered the public domain, had the length of copyright not been extended to the heat death of the universe, yeah, that I&#39;ll give you.

These so-called âoedodgy boxesâ let you watch content that otherwise you&#39;d have to pay for. For example, a full subscription to Sky TV including film and sports channels is close to $100 per month. Subscriptions for these boxes will run you about $100 per year.

The people running these services are essentially re-broadcasting paid-for content for a fraction of the price. The big companies are starting to notice too; I&#39;ve seen a few scaremongering &#39;news&#39; articles about them these past few months.

You&#39;d be surprised. A friend of mine has one and though it sometimes freezes for a few seconds the quality is just as good as what I would expect from Sky. I was tempted to get one myself but for a couple of football games it&#39;s not worth the hassle.

One other thing, the box was some sort of nvidia device (Toblerone shaped) and the UI is so much snappier than any STB or smart TV I&#39;ve ever used. As ever, the pirates&#39; user experience is better than the paying customers&#39;.

That&#39;s quite probably not all they are doing. [krebsonsecurity.com]  Remember, if it&#39;s too good/cheap to be true, then *you* are probably the product or, in this case, your bandwidth and IP address.

I don&#39;t quite understand the purpose. Most smart TVs come with a free IPTV bundle. My LG came with LG channels, that has a few hundred free streaming channels to watch. Tubi does the same thing on any smart gizmo, you can plug into a TV, the cheapest of which is around $40.
Because while those services do exist (typically using the FAST approach for older content with lower licensing costs), they do not always cover what some people want to view (I am guessing things like ESPN).

There is, and will continue to be, a disconnect between what consumers are willing to pay, and what the owners expect to receive in revenue, for the content being produced.

The Smart TV&#39;s don&#39;t come with &quot;dodgy&quot; piracy apps. The boxes are basically just preloaded with Kodi, and then a bunch of plugins for backends that are basically just abusing various system&#39;s CDN&#39;s.

Like facebook is a popular CDN to steal bandwidth from by pirates. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen &quot;watch (whatever) online&quot; sites, if you go poke through their source code you can see what sites they are getting the data from.

Once outside the paywall, it no longer can generate revenue.

Content is not like shelter, healthcare, or sustenance.  people will do without if control is tightened to the point where no one can watch the content.

The fact that it is non-essential for supporting life means that there is a limit on how much revenue can be generated. At some point you reach a diminishing point of return on the curve where it is no longer profitable to go after the consumers pirating the content.

As the economy deteriorates over the next few years, more consumers are going to ask &quot;Why am it paying do much for this&quot;, this is going to cause subscriber counts to drop. Expect enhanced enforcement from the producers and distributors, but at some point they&#39;ll just be wasting their money.

Why should I put up with high ad loads while I consume linear content. It used to be that ad loads were lower decades ago, but then almost everyone has no choice but broadcast television and radio. Now, with fewer eyeballs watching radio and TV, the ad loads had to go up because broadcast ratings count eyeballs.

TV, though, has seen any content worth watching being locked behind the paywall of streaming.  That&#39;s where the difference is really noticeable, because terrestrial broadcast networks have given up trying to chase eyeballs and are now going after subscrib

That&#39;s where the difference is really noticeable, because terrestrial broadcast networks have given up trying to chase eyeballs and are now going after subscribers.  So, over-the-air TV has become a dumping ground for everything nobody is willing to pay to watch.

And yet that stuff is still pretty watchable.  In my area, there are two specialty channels I like, one for sci-fi (comet) and the other for westerns (grit) and both keep showing me either stuff I&#39;ve never seen, or stuff I&#39;ve seen and don&#39;t mind running in the background as I exercise or do work of some sort.

You are not describing all cable TV that way.  Millions use DVR&#39;s and TiVo and have it record and have ready hundreds of programs the user DOES want to see and CAN skip or zoom through commercials.

If you are watching &quot;live&quot; TV, you are doing it wrong.  (And there is no way I would ever do that).  The main issue with CATV is the cost of cable TV is absurd.  For my ONE PERSON ho

Paying that same $15 to 10 different vendors for the same level of service pretty much ensures that piracy will be rampant.See, I&#39;d argue that paying $15 would be a bit more tolerable if it was the same level of service that Netflix had in 2014. The problem is that we went from one service that had basically-everything, to a dozen services that have 1-2 shows we want to watch and 1,000 we don&#39;t. Now, *that* wouldn&#39;t be so bad if those services reflected the difference; 10 services at $5 a pop might still ultimately be more than Netflix was at its peak, but it&#39;d at least be a bit more palpable because it&#39;s so cheap...but, to you

Definitely not everyone is stealing TV. I&#39;m opposed to piracy and I&#39;m definitely not plugging one of these janky Android Trojan horses into my network.

But, the price gouging is totally out of control! Cable companies and streaming services alike. They are priced absurdly high. Even more so when one considers the low quality programming that they are pushing. Then they layer ads on top of services I&#39;m supposed to pay for? Fuck them. Piracy may well be on the table in the near future.

Not to mention going from one remote that worked properly to multiple remotes that don&#39;t work as expected and new issues with every update and every gadget.

Where is the smart in smart TVs? To me they are the Trojan horses. I had to move them off the main network.

Piracy sounds simpler and way less intrusive

We have this in South America for a looong time. I would estimate some 80% of households use these boxes.

It became so widespread that the major streaming platforms started to pressure the governments. Most of the devices were outlawed and recently there were huge cross-border crackdowns that took the pirat... ahem, alternative platforms down.

One very funny thing is that because it was a paid service, most people didn&#39;t even realized it was illegal. When the boxes started to get bricked, consumer protection organizations got flooded with millions of complaints. There are reports of people that even reported it to the police.

it suggests that the subscription costs are too high. If the pricing structure cuts out most people and they have to find another way to access the content, then lower your price.

One problem with the content market is they are hell bent on extracting the most money out of the market, they keep increasing costs and also moving content so a consumer has to access multiple subscriptions. All this puts pressure on consumers and they either have to dropout or get content another way.

Why pay for a pirate service?  It&#39;s the equivalent of &#39;script kiddie&#39; hacking.

You can find streams of pretty much anything and just download what you want to keep, and barring someone breaking into your home and taking the hardware, it can&#39;t be taken from you.

If it&#39;s on broadcast TV where you live, this is no different than grabbing it off the air with a DVR.

Why pay for a pirate service? It&#39;s the equivalent of &#39;script kiddie&#39; hacking.Cost, obviously. Convenience, reliability, the fact that you don&#39;t need to faff around trying to find a link that actually works. These things aren&#39;t aimed at hax0rs, l33t or otherwise. They&#39;re easy enough to use that your granny could do it.

Obligatory joke and not surprised nothing else has come up on today&#39;s Slashdot. Your better joke below:

(I wanted to put a down arrow here, but couldn&#39;t figure out a way to do it on ye olde Slashdot.)

The thing I find most incredible about this is that people are willing to track down and spend hundreds of dollars on a dubious piece of hardware, jump through whatever hoops they have to jump through to set it up, and maintain functionality over time - just to avoid dealing with the hassle of piecing together a decent media package/

Some of this is a pricing problem. Some of this is customer greed. But you know what else it is? It&#39;s an obvious outcome of a system that keeps fragmenting and driving insane cu

... my rabbit ears when you pry them out of my cold, dead hands.

I hear you and like the sentiment but broadcast tv is about to be encrypted across the board.  You&#39;ll still need to pay.

I own the superbox.  I don&#39;t watch much TV, so it doesn&#39;t see much use, but yes, it has nearly everything.  More stations than I know what to do with, all the sports channels if you care about that stuff, video on demand (they&#39;re just downloaded torrents) so while most are good quality, some have the weird logos or closed caption forced in, but mostly it all just works.

I do like the live tv rewind feature too.  Show started at 5 o&#39;clock and it&#39;s 5:20?  No worries, just start from the beginning.  Not availab

Let&#39;s not adopt the language of the dark side, shall we?

Streaming services optimize their profits by accounting for the amount of copyright infringement that is a result of their higher prices. Therefore, the fact that &quot;everyone&quot; is not paying for their content is an acceptable part of their business plan. If they have miscalculated then that&#39;s on them, not me.

Ahhhh yes, I&#39;m &quot;stealing&quot; the freely available over-the-air digital TV signals available here in the Seattle area. Darn those pesky corporations producing pirate airwaves that anyone and everyone can freely tap into with their TV or a box like HDHomeRun! Absolutely horrible.

How soon we forget:  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/...  [eff.org]

If you take a look into some of the technical write-ups on that, you&#39;ll see it was involved with everything from ad-injection to click-fraud to DDoS to selling your internet connection as residential VPNs and proxies, etc.  And simply wiping these devices and installing a clean Android image was often not enough, since their bootloaders had bootkits in them that eventually reloaded the malicious apps and malware on to them.

If you&#39;re in it for the long term, now&#39;s the time to buy software stocks, I guess.

...as long as they aren&#39;t one of the companies that bet the farm on AI...

Those companies will never recover. On the plus side, Windows 12 can&#39;t be any worse than Windows 11 if Microsoft died before Windows 12 was released.

Yes, I meant traditional software companies that produce software and not vibe-coded vulnerability-ware.

Gaming stocks dumping after google showed off their latest image-generator-on-meth shows how much investors understand about this stuff.

&quot;risks including competition from AI-native firms and clients building their own solutions in-house&quot;

Apparently investors think the software companies could be overtaken permanently.

I&#39;ve been frustrated by AI constantly making shit up and stating things as fact when it&#39;s clearly wrong.  But then I realized if you read around the internet that it&#39;s full of posts that are just factually untrue.  Like I&#39;m not talking about opinion stuff... I mean people posting absolutely untrue &quot;facts&quot; even on technical forums where a very cursory google search with turn up multiple independent sources that show they&#39;re completely wrong.

So, it turns out that if you can make a program that&#39;s only correct 90% of the time, you&#39;ve already created a program that&#39;s correct more often than the average employee, so it&#39;s probably useful.  This is completely backwards to how I think about computers, but I can&#39;t deny it.  Humans are just a lot less useful than I thought, particularly if you need them to make correct decisions.

The problem is, most people have learned to have a bit of healthy skepticism about what humans say and produce, whereas a lot more people accept anything an AI program says without any questioning.

And once AI started to get bandied about in public, the computer clergy added a new branch to their kind, the AI prophets, determined to promote the idea of computer god among the masses. And way too many people that should know better are falling for it.

If I search for what type of oil to use in my car, there will be pages and pages of forum posts of people bickering about who&#39;s wrong answer is the best.  ChatGPT gets it right the first time, and that&#39;s amazing considering it&#39;s trained on so many wrong answers.  And I&#39;d say its WAY more than 90% accurate.

The oil specified for your vehicle by the manufacturer might or might not be the best thing to put in it. You didn&#39;t give us enough information to know if that fact is relevant, but since it might be, I put that here.

I am not talking about brands here either, if you do changes on schedule that is mostly irrelevant. I mean some vehicles are better run with a different weight than specified, usually due to engineering failure.

Having just spent a few days butting heads with an outsourced customer service call center, I can&#39;t disagree.  These people repeatedly hallucinate facts, deny facts already in evidence, and contradict each other.  When I point this out (it&#39;s all in writing) they simply ignore what I say and repeat the behavior.

If you replaced all those people with AI, there would be problems, but maybe not worse or even fundamentally different problems.

SaaS has always been a shady business model. Now AI has experts as the only people left doing anything with building new Software, at a massively hiked productivity that still is rising almost by the week. And since AI does not care if it&#39;s working on FOSS or proprietary Software - it&#39;s actually more likely to deliver for FOSS, since FOSS documentation isn&#39;t hidden behind a paywall and can easily be processed by LLMs - experts will be using AI to work on FOSS, because they&#39;ve long since come to love the adv

On the one hand, most SaaS solutions are just webified implementations of crap that would be better suited to dBase III on DOS. On the flip side, AI as it&#39;s being sold is SaaS in all its worst forms, except now its results aren&#39;t repetable.

This index of companies is down, yes. But each company on that index  is down (or up) for different reasons.

Oracle, for example, is down in part because of the huge exposure it has to an AI bubble.Salesforce, likewise, has invested huge amounts of money and marketing on its AI gamble, which might well not play out as they hope.Fair Isaac, which doesn&#39;t have an obvious reason to be in a software index, and which isn&#39;t apparently highly exposed to risk from AI, is just down to where it was in September of las

They are a bit like fortune tellers, trying to not only predict an increasingly unpredictable future, but trying to predict what other investors will doIt&#39;s like a casino for the insane

As a society, we cannot create disruptive technologies and not expect disruption.

When I look around my industrial estate, full of fabricators, tool suppliers, hydraulics, hardware, car repair, pipe extrusion, specialist bakeries and printers,  you know, where real life happens outside the tech bubble, I can assure you AI will have zero impact for the foreseeable future. The main use I see so far, is a better search engine.

Just imagine a group of Allen-Bradley robots with welders as end-effectors and machine vision, controlled by an LLM-AI of some sort.  Goodbye welding job (you say that&#39;s only stationary... what prevents them from having one on a trailer?).Specialist bakeries?  So, a robot could never pump out icing perfectly to say &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; or bake a loaf of sourdough?

In the near future, all of that will be automated completely... why pay someone an hourly wage to screw something up, when you can have a robot do it

Sure, it might fuck up the biosphere and ultimately kill humanity, that&#39;s cool. But look, now we&#39;re talking real problems. It might cause a minor disruption for Wall Street! SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!

No, Nvidia will not die if OpenAI considers if there are also other graphic card companies. No, a proof of concept world model will not create games on its own. Sometimes one thinks people investing at the stock market don&#39;t have *any* idea about what the companies actually do when buying the shares.

On the other hand, any of the LLMs are pretty decent at making web forms. Good enough you might be tempted to make your own instead of paying Peoplesoft or Salesforce a monthly fee to do it for you. Or maybe a few friends get together and make something customized for your specific niche and charge a fraction of what they do.

Here, they are pondering, if writing can be automated by a machine, as promised.  If everyone can produce their own software, the demand for commercial software will disappear.  They are trying to put a price on that.  Then, they need a new place to park their money.  But which businesses won&#39;t lose employees and profits from the spre

Don&#39;t worry... the off-shore accounts are fully stacked with all the money you could imagine.That&#39;s all the C-suite guys care about.

If the mad race to create superintelligent AI continues then it is human existence we will need to worry about, not financial viability of some companies.

The day a human-level AI is created is the day we all become utterly pointless.  Not that life isn&#39;t already pointless if you think to much about it, but right now we have some things we can do that entertain us, we can indulge our nicer social primate instincts and share those things with friends, etc.

The company will have partners and investor interests and there is bound to be a conversation about getting the AI to prioritize or recommend products and services from partners and sponsors and have input from investors on how users could be influenced.

I&#39;m fairly certain this will happen with all AI. They will rank preferred interests higher.

In what world is a seller compensating for referrals if it&#39;s demonstrably provable to the customer (and hence the seller) that the referral bonus in no way influences the recommendation - or even the pool of options the recommendation is singled out from - provided to the user?

If you read the post, they don&#39;t really make promises. They talk about what &quot;they want&quot; Claude to be, but nowhere does it say they will &quot;never&quot; include ads. Even if it did, I wouldn&#39;t believe them for a minute. The pull of money is too strong.

While OpenAI is desperately trying to monetize everything they touch, for-profit Anthropic is protecting the environment.  With profit motives, winner-take-all markets and &quot;too big to care&quot; cartels driving the technology, that will not be sustainable.

You talk about getting laid off as though it&#39;s a bad thing. IRL it&#39;s a bit more nuanced than that.

While it&#39;s true that people who get laid off stop getting paychecks (which most of us would immediately miss!) it does come with a gigantic upside.

If you get laid off, then you don&#39;t have to go to work anymore. That results in you getting a whole third of the remaining grains in your hourglass-of-life back. Those 8 hours a day of your one-and-only limited life, no longer being wasted on misery.

Not having a choice in your employment seems like something worse to me than having a choice.

It sort of parallels silly arguments about how serfs and slaves have a good life that might be better off with, so it justifies the injustice of the relationship. Or a man that beats his wife, but his wife gets nice clothes and jewelry as an apology so she is somehow better off. Real bullshit if you ask me.

At least with most breakups there&#39;s no financial dependency for your crude logic to hinge on.

The rest of your spiel will /s pretty nicely though. &quot;This breakup is great bro!! Now you can go out with someone better!&quot;

Personally I live like a miser and would be fine for a while, but even sensible spenders/savers will be on a short clock when such an &quot;opportunity&quot; comes crashing into their budget.

I remember a steel union demanding higher wages, the plant meeting their demand, and the union calling a strike anyway because there hadn&#39;t been a strike in ages.This is either BS, or you&#39;re grossly misrepresenting what happened.First, a union that neogiates with an employer that meets their demands and goes on strike anyway is bargaining in bad faith. If either side did such a thing, the other side can go to court to seek remedies.Second, a union cannot go on strike on a whim. They have to be in a legal strike position (their contract has expired.) The same goes for an employer who locks out employees. And unlike an employer, a union has to have a strike mandate from its membership, i.e., a majority vote for job action.And finally, no union calls a strike just because there hasn&#39;t been one &quot;in ages.&quot; Going on strike is a serious thing, with consequences for both sides. No union takes such a decision lightly.

Even with a union these two engineers would be fired, it&#39;s not really the scripts which got them fired, it&#39;s the accessing confidential information and making it public that got them fired. So it&#39;s a proper reason to fire them, no union can do something about that.I think the argument is that with a union, the company wouldn&#39;t be able to keep that information secret from union leadership.  And assuming the union leadership is not under some legal obligation to keep it secret (e.g. some privacy law explicitly requiring it), the union leadership could have disseminated that information, and the two engineers would not have needed to access confidential information in the first place.And I think that&#39;s probably a reasonable argument unless there are laws dictating other

Those responsible for tracking the people who have just been sacked, have been sacked.FTFY

A moose once bit my sister... oh wait we&#39;re already past that part

Hello. What?! Well, if you can&#39;t work as a team, you&#39;re all fired! That&#39;s it, you heard me, &quot;Fired&quot;. Get your things and go.
  Hello, Security. Everyone on Floor 4 is fired. Escort them from the premises. And do it as a team. Remember, you&#39;re a team, and if you can&#39;t work as a team, you&#39;re fired too!Dawn, get onto recruitment. Get them to look for a security team that can work as a team. They may have to escort the current security team from the building for not acting like a team!

Team! Team, team, team, team, team. I even love saying the word ‘team’. You probably think this is a picture of my family? No! It’s a picture of The A-Team.

I&#39;m just surprised Pinterest has so many employees remaining. What could they possibly be doing? Pinterest hasn&#39;t meaningfully changed in like 15 years now. It was always kind of worthless to begin with.

I don&#39;t even know yet what Pinterest is. At some point, I thought it was a fork of the University of Washington Pine email client.

Remember &quot;I will replace you with a very small shell script&quot;?

We&#39;re essentially replacing people with a very big script now. But they are being replaced. The inevitable has arrived.

They weren&#39;t sacked for writing a script, they were sacked for accessing private HR data. Big difference. Most companies would have sacked them.

I could do the same thing at my job (not that I need to since we&#39;re the ones deactivating accounts) and nobody would be any the wiser. It&#39;s not hard to correlate account deactivations with people being terminated. Their mistake was that they &quot;shared it more broadly&quot;. If they&#39;d just kept quiet nobody would have known, but they decided to go public with the list, and the nail that sticks up...

Not making a judgment btw, it was their choice to make, but anyone could have predicted this outcome.

It&#39;s not the same information in terms of privacy.layoffs.xls is a document that&#39;s not shared.

But if the company uses a platform like slack where people can clearly see people disappearing, then they share that data and can&#39;t possibly claim people aggregating the data they shared have done anything wrong...

&quot;The script written by the Pinterest engineers was aimed at internal tools used at the company for employees to communicate&quot;

It wasn&#39;t Slack. The summary compares the tool to Slack.

Yes, and in the EU the fired employees will probably get treated better than in the US. In the US management would try to fire them for Gross Misconduct which means that you don&#39;t get any unemployment insurance, and if they had a non-compete clause in there employment documents, it would remain in force until it  expires.

In they US they would throw us into the protein vats if they could get away with it. It&#39;s not just a legal problem with US labor laws, it is a hostile unethical culture that sustains our current corporate standards.

They were sacked for looking at slack statuses. Stop carrying corporate water.

I worked at a company that had a couple of silent layoffs.  We had to poke around Slack, and other corporate-wide software to see who was gone.  The company didn&#39;t announce anything.  How else were we to know who was gone?  I should have written a script!

This is actually useful stuff because when a manager leaves involuntarily the meetings in Outlook (please die Outlook!) don&#39;t automatically get canceled or reassigned.  We end up with meetings that can&#39;t be deleted by anyone left and if you don&#39;t know the m

We tracked that using jira tickets : IT had account deactivation tickets, tracking those gave a very precise overview of what was going on.

This is why there needs to be another channel to do account activations outside of tracking software such as Jira. The Director of HR should have gone to the Director of IT, and the director of IT should have delegated the task to someone who they trust to take care of the account deletions outside of any tracking software.

Yeah, this is very much an ESH situation. Publishing private information about (ex)coworkers is a dick move even if it&#39;s done due to a lack of communication from the business itself which is deciding to disrupt people&#39;s lives over a fucking tech fad.

A pox on all their houses. As the Pinterest product itself seems successful hopefully a business will be built to replace those jobs when someone addresses the hole in the market when Pinterest inevitably goes bust.

The IT person who didn&#39;t implement a security policy which would have prevented access to the confidential data. And if the sacked engineers who used slack deactivations, the HR person who preemptively removed the affected employees from slack before the layoffs were conducted and the people escorted out.

They weren&#39;t sacked for writing a script, they were sacked for accessing private HR data. Big difference. Most companies would have sacked them.Was it private data?  I wrote something like that at a prior company to track the changes in the list of employees returned by a corp DB query over time.  The query wasn&#39;t restricted internally.

Was it private data?  I wrote something like that at a prior company to track the changes in the list of employees returned by a corp DB query over time.  The query wasn&#39;t restricted internally.

But was it really private data, or was the company just trying to hide exactly how many they let go and whom? Even the article doesn&#39;t say what data was accessed, but if it was only employee name and city the employee worked in, I don&#39;t see that to be private at all. In fact, such a list would be really helpful.

It seems to have become the normal in the last 10 years or so to do layoffs but then not tell anyone who was let go. The problem is that when you (as the employee) need to do something special and &quot;J

It seemed like there were layoffs every Friday for a period of time. When you were getting the axe they would disable you in Active Directory by adding an underscore in front of your name. So, the internal website, &quot;Death Watch&quot;, would just look for accounts that were changed to _username and list them on the website.

A number of companies still do this where they don&#39;t broadcast that someone has left the company. Absolutely maddening when someone is just GONE and no one says anything.  They nag me about getting my expenses done but when I email the lady that was the POC for expenses and find out through the grapevine 10 days later that she&#39;s gone, then how the hell am I supposed to get my expenses done and I&#39;m having an issue submitting?

I briefly worked at one place where they tried to mandate that I add someone from ma

Yeah, none of the companies I&#39;ve worked at have notified workers.  Sometimes they notify managers.   Last time I was laid off no one told my project manager.  I had a customer deliverable due in three days and if I hadn&#39;t sent him a goodbye email on my way out (they can&#39;t instantly deactivate your account when you&#39;re working from home and you&#39;re let go over Zoom) he wouldn&#39;t have known I was gone until after the deliverable was missed.  It would have been a major issue.  No clue what happened after I left.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Enrich’s whole life right now is the Epstein files. As an investigations editor at the New York Times, his phone and computer basically explode whenever new files are released.Last Friday, his phone exploded again when the Department of Justice dropped about 3 million pages of documents into the cloud.

Back in November, Democrats and Republicans worked together to force the DOJ to release all they’d discovered about Jeffrey Epstein—the country’s most notorious sex criminal and probably one of the richest, too. With this latest release, the DOJ says it has satisfied that demand. But it’s not even all they’ve got.

The Times built its own internal search engine to sort through the sludge. It doesn’t just search for specific words; you can ask it to search for concepts like bribery. And these documents aren’t just emails about President Donald Trump, or giddy vacation planning for rich folks hoping to hop a ride to Epstein’s infamous island. There are photos and videos, even bank records.

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Enrich about the latest Epstein file drop and what it says about Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Before we dig into exactly what’s in the file and what it says, what does the sheer volume of what’s been released tell you?

David Enrich: I don’t have much confidence in the government. I don’t have much sense that the majority of this stuff has been read thoroughly.

When these files were released, a number of things seemed to have been released by mistake. The implication of that is that they didn’t know exactly what they were releasing. But it’s also really awful stuff. Pictures of women and young girls without any kind of redaction. They’re identifiable, nude. Very upsetting, essentially. And your team was part of the team that found that, right?

This has been a real mess by the government. The argument they make is that they only had two months to pull this stuff together because the Epstein Files Transparency Act was passed and signed into law in November, with a December deadline. But the truth is that Trump came into office saying he was going to be transparent about this and release the files, and they made a series of choices and decisions not to do that, which I think were based in part on their gradual understanding of the fact that what was in these may be damaging to Trump or his allies.

So they then entered this frenzied period, starting in November, and did not do a good job. There are a huge number of things in there that are identifying victims, a number of files that have a high likelihood of being child sexual abuse material, and all sorts of other damaging stuff that serves no public interest and was not, in fact, required by law to be disclosed. What they’ve done is all these haphazard redactions, redacting a bunch of things they’re not supposed to redact. We found that Steve Bannon had texted Epstein, and Epstein’s name was redacted, and Trump’s face was redacted. And it’s like, why on earth would that stuff be redacted? At the same time, we’re seeing victims’ names identified.

The government is being somewhat responsive now when things are being brought to their attention. They’re taking them down and are re-redacting them. But at the same time, they appear to have overredacted quite a bit of stuff.

What stands out to me in this possible final release of files is the way that neither Donald Trump nor Jeffrey Epstein seem to be able to escape each other. These are two people who were friends in the 1990s and early 2000s. There are reports that there was a falling-out between them. Epstein gets arrested for sex acts with a minor. Donald Trump decides to run for president. But these guys can’t stop talking about each other.

Yeah, they were very close for a while, but Epstein’s defining human trait was an ability to seize on his connections and leverage them for as much currency as he could. And that came in many forms, right? That’s why he had all these pictures of himself with famous people in his houses, because he liked to be able to show those off to other famous people, or to use these as a threat hanging over the heads of his victims.

With Trump, it’s playing out in some different ways. Part of it is that with Trump’s rise to power back in 2016, Epstein realized that here was someone who had great power to either make Epstein’s life better or worse. And so I think he was really trying to suss out, initially, how he could pull those different levers. It obviously didn’t work very well, since during Trump’s first term, Epstein ended up in prison and then died.

And the files were kind of a useful tool for Trump and Trump’s allies, in particular, to beat Democrats and fan the flames of conspiracy theories on the far right. There’s no doubt that one of the things that got Trump elected in 2024 was this band of far-right MAGA people who were convinced that Trump was going to expose this global ring of pedophiles on the left and through the Epstein files.

The big allegation about Trump in these latest files involves calls to the FBI’s tip line. And these are a little dicey to talk about, because these are unverified tips. The FBI gets all kinds of unverified tips all the time. But could you just lay out what’s in there?

I’m going to be like a really anal New York Times reporter. We’ve made a decision institutionally that we’re not going to give airtime to things that we really just have no idea if they are true or not, especially when they’re of this lurid nature. But I mean, in general, it’s just very lurid sexual allegations involving Trump in the context of his relationship with Epstein. And they’re very bad allegations.

Let’s talk about some of the other big names that have been in the spotlight since the latest release. My understanding is that in these files, you see Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick trying to make plans to go to Epstein’s island. He was in friendly contact with Jeffrey Epstein long after he said he’d shut the relationship down.

Yeah, and the crazy thing here is that Lutnik just last year had said not only that he had shut the relationship down, but he had given this whole explanation for why he’d shut it down, which was that he’d visited Epstein’s mansion and he’d seen stuff in there that made him and his wife really uncomfortable. And they had vowed then and there to never associate with this terrible man again. But what we see in these files shows that’s just not true at all. They by all accounts had a pretty chummy relationship. They visited Epstein on his island long after this alleged encounter in the townhouse that left them so unsettled.

There’s also Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft. There have been allegations for years that Gates and Jeffrey Epstein were close. But in this latest release of documents, there are these implications that Epstein was helping procure women for Bill Gates and that Gates got a sexually transmitted infection, and was trying to get drugs to treat himself and secretly treat his own wife. She’s been asked about this, and she’s given an answer basically saying, This takes me back to the worst times of my marriage, which isn’t a, like, Hell no, this didn’t happen. It’s something quite different.

We’ve known for years, since Epstein’s death, about the long-running relationship between Gates and Epstein that involved everything, apparently, from science to money to women, or girls perhaps. I can’t say I’m shocked to see Gates’ reentry into this. The thing I’ll caution about here is—and I’m not at all defending Gates or his apparent conduct, and it is entirely possible that those emails were true and accurately reflected what Epstein and people like Gates did—but it is possible that Epstein is a liar and an embellisher and an expert in using threats and leverage to get what he wants with powerful people. And so it is not outside the realm of possibility that Epstein was exaggerating or twisting the truth. That being said, we know, and this has been out there in public for a while, that part of the reason that Bill and Melinda Gates got divorced was her discomfort with her husband’s relationship with Epstein. And while we’ve never really had the full gory details and what that’s entailed, it’s obviously been a subject of informed speculation.

Elon Musk is in here. He’s writing to Jeffrey Epstein asking, When is the wildest party on your island, because I want to make sure that I come. What do you make of this?

Once again, we are seeing people who had previously denied or downplayed their relationships with Epstein, and in fact had pointed at other people for being more connected to Epstein, we are now seeing that they, long after Epstein was known as a sexual criminal and had registered as a Level 3 sex offender, were continuing to associate with him.

You’ve talked about transparency being important here. Can we talk about what we’re not seeing in this release of documents? We were promised 6 million documents. I thought they were legally required to release all the files, so what is happening there?

That is a good question, and I don’t have a good answer. What the Justice Department has said is that they withheld a large quantity of documents to protect victims’ identities.Two things can be true: They can be protecting victims’ identities by not releasing 3 million documents and they can also be doing a bad job of protecting victims’ identities in the 3 million pages of documents that they did release. That being said, this administration’s handling of the Epstein files doesn’t have a whole lot of credibility.

A year ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel said they released the Epstein files by handing binders full of public court documents to a group of MAGA influencers. That was the whole start of this. And it’s gone along on the same trajectory with deceitful disclosures. In that context, I think it is normal and reasonable for open-minded people to be skeptical and curious about what’s actually in these other 3 million pages of documents.

To get to this point, Congress had to act of its own accord, essentially, and force the release. Are there other avenues available to lawmakers who want to see more here?

The Justice Department has said it is going to meet with lawmakers to explain its thinking. The other options are not necessarily in terms of getting these files, but there are other ways to get some more transparency. And one of the things we’ve seen is that the House Oversight Committee has issued a bunch of subpoenas to a wide variety of people demanding that they sit for depositions under oath, the transcripts of which will presumably be released in short order. And that ranges from people like the Clintons to people like former Victoria Secret CEO Les Wexner, who was one of Epstein’s biggest financial benefactors over the years. We’ll see what happens.

There are a huge number of wealthy, powerful individuals all over the world who continued to associate with Epstein and provide him with various kinds of support long after he went to jail.To me, what has made the Epstein story so riveting and so important for so many years is that yes, this is a story about a guy who is a pedophile and was doing terrible things to women and girls. But much more than that, it is a story about how one individual, when he accrues enough wealth and influence and connections, can work the entire global system to his benefit for very nefarious purposes. And he does it in conjunction and in some cases partnership with some of the richest, most powerful people on Earth. And that is a story that has not yet fully been told.

Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get any stranger, the Trump administration has injected abortion law into its efforts to stamp out anti-ICE protests. Last week, Don Lemon, an independent reporter, and two protesters were arrested on federal charges arising out of an anti–Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest at a Minnesota church. One of the key charges involves the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, legislation passed in 1993 to protect access to reproductive health facilities and places of worship. Understanding the law’s past and present reveals how the Department of Justice has repurposed it to crack down on protest that the president opposes.

The FACE Act passed at a time of escalating anti-abortion protest. Abortion opponents had watched as Republican presidents reshaped the U.S. Supreme Court, but abortion remained legal. Frustrations spilled over, and a growing number of Americans joined clinic blockades led by Operation Rescue, a group that sought to shut down abortion clinics. As Time magazine reported, the primary tactic Operation Rescue used was “to jam all entrances to an abortion clinic before the police can muster sufficient officers to begin arrests.”

Operation Rescue members did get arrested but often faced minor charges, like trespassing, before quickly returning to the protest front lines. Most of those who attended these protests were peaceful—Operation Rescue instructed recruits on what it called nonviolent civil disobedience. But the group’s message was that lawbreaking was justified in the name of saving the lives of the unborn.

That message was hard to contain, and by 1993, anti-abortion extremists were arguing that it was legitimate to use violence against providers. That year saw the first of a series of murders of abortion doctors. Congress responded with the FACE Act, which sought to distinguish peaceful protest and speech (much of which is protected under the First Amendment) from violence, threats of force, and efforts to obstruct access to clinics. Sponsored by Democrat Ted Kennedy and Republican Constance Morella, the law drew inspiration partly from a federal law already protecting “interference with rights,” including religious exercise.

The addition of places of worship was meant to doom passage of the act at a time when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress; a staffer for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (the now-prominent conservative Ed Whelan) added the language as a poison pill. There was also a plan to mock the bill if it passed: Whelan hoped that the addition would change the acronym for the law to the FARCE Act.

But Kennedy was in favor of the addition in no small part because of the historic victimization of Black churches, synagogues, and other places of worship—a trend that was all too evident in several mass shootings last year. If anything, the tactic cemented the bill’s bipartisan appeal: Seventeen Republican senators and three members of the House ultimately supported it.

Abortion opponents immediately challenged the law’s constitutionality under the First Amendment, arguing that the statute censored speech and singled out abortion foes for prosecution. The courts rejected that argument by stressing that the FACE Act was narrow: It applied only to conduct and was enforced regardless of what message protesters intended to convey. Constitutional arguments against the act have reemerged since the demise of Roe v. Wade, with the CATO Institute arguing that there may no longer be any congressional authority for the law and that it may thus be unconstitutional.

The FACE Act had a major impact on the clinic blockade movement, which relied on a large number of recruits to stop patients from entering abortion clinics. Rather than minor trespassing charges, protesters now weighed the prospect of serious fines and prison time, with penalties escalating for repeat offenders.

But the line between speech and obstruction, threats, or violence can sometimes be messy to draw in context. That meant that federal prosecutors were often reluctant to bring FACE Act charges, even when Democrats were in office. With Joe Biden in the White House, federal prosecutors did file charges against not only anti-abortion groups like Red Rose Rescue (a next-generation clinic blockade group) but also Jane’s Revenge, a militant abortion-rights group that carried out a campaign of vandalism, arson, and bombing.

Fast-forward to 2026, when the FACE Act is enjoying a bizarre renaissance. Over the years, bipartisan consensus about the legislation collapsed, and conservative Republicans began calling for its repeal. Then, in January 2025, a spokesperson for the Trump administration announced that the White House would no longer enforce the FACE Act absent “extraordinary circumstances” or “significant aggravating factors.” Abortion opponents clearly see this announcement as an opportunity. Randall Terry, the 77-year-old founder of Operation Rescue, is working with his girlfriend, Terrisa Bukovinac, the 44-year-old leader of a group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, to launch a new wave of protests and reach a younger generation of potential recruits.

But “extraordinary circumstances” might not be as hard for the administration to find when the president doesn’t like what protesters are saying. The White House has turned its FACE Act focus toward language protecting places of worship from those who interfere with religious exercise “by force or threat of force or physical obstruction” to target messages that the administration opposes.

First came an indictment against a group of pro-Palestinian protesters and organizations arising from a November 2024 demonstration outside a New Jersey synagogue. Organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation in New Jersey and American Muslims for Palestine New Jersey, the protest targeted an event promoting the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. What happened next is unclear, but violence broke out between the protesters and pro-Israel counterprotesters. New Jersey prosecutors concluded that pro-Israel demonstrators were the first to cross the line into violence, and the Department of Justice disagreed. Either way, it seemed to be a strange choice for an administration that had announced a lack of interest in enforcing the FACE Act to prioritize a case in which local law enforcement saw the facts so differently.

Now the administration is pursuing similar charges against Don Lemon. The former CNN anchor and his co-defendants faced charges based on an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church, a site that was chosen because protesters believed its pastor to be the acting director of a local ICE field office. At the time, 3,000 ICE agents had flooded the Twin Cities, and Renee Good had recently been shot and killed by federal immigration officials. Alex Pretti would be killed later in the ICE surge.

Prosecutors claim that Lemon, a noted critic of the president, helped organize the Cities Church protest, which they frame as an attack. The indictment charges that Lemon then obstructed church members from leaving by posting himself at the door and asking them questions.

Based on the available evidence, it’s hard to see these charges as anything but disturbing and wrong. Video of the incident shows heated exchanges between Lemon and his interview subjects, who clearly disagree with him about immigration policy and the conduct of ICE in the Twin Cities. There are moments when the journalist is asked to leave, or when the people to whom he’s speaking clearly want to move on. And people do leave, including the ones Lemon seems to aggravate the most. The video doesn’t show much more physical contact than Lemon pushing his microphone into the subjects’ faces. If that act qualifies as physical obstruction, it’s hard to see what kind of press scrum would not.

Drawing the line between protected speech and obstruction or threats isn’t always straightforward. And even when the line is clear, protests about everything from ICE to abortion often involve civil disobedience like trespassing. Those protests can involve speech that is rude, unconvincing, or even hateful. But the line between protected speech and wrongful conduct can’t depend on the reasons people are protesting. With this latest prosecution, that’s just the danger we face.

From Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis to Maine, ICE agents are leaving a trail of destruction and fear. The most important harms they leave behind are broken lives, injuries, and deaths. There are already important efforts in the works to hold them to account via criminal investigations and civil actions. Yet these actions will be hard to win. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are wreaking another, second-string harm, this one involving the destruction of personal property. This damage flagrantly violates another constitutional provision—and there is a clear and uncluttered legal pathway to address those harms that so far has not been invoked. It’s past time it was used.

ICE’s violent enforcement actions often involve the needless destruction of people’s personal property. The Fifth Amendment’s takings clause makes such property destruction unconstitutional. Demanding damages for these harms may seem to miss the mark, in the sense that they do not address the features that make ICE’s strategies so horrifying, specifically the physical violence against human beings. This is quite fair. But often there will simply be no other practical way for ICE’s victims to obtain redress, such that an action for property harms may well be the best, even the only, route available.

Take the case of Minneapolis resident ChongLy “Scott” Thao. In January, ICE agents battered down Thao’s door, dragged him out in his underwear, and handled him in a degrading, contemptuous, and very likely racist manner—before confirming that he was, as he said, a U.S. citizen. Thao surely ought to be able to seek damages for the grave harms to his person and dignity. The conservative Roberts court, however, has made such damages actions—called Bivens suits—extremely hard to win thanks to doctrines such as “qualified immunity.” The latter is a misleading name, as it is practically insurmountable in many cases. Some federal courts of appeals have even ruled that ICE agents are categorically immune from constitutional damages actions under all circumstances.

But the facts of Thao’s case are unlikely to prove outliers in coming weeks. ICE has developed an internal policy memo telling its officers that they can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judicial warrant. This policy, which perversely echoes the British colonial abuses that precipitated the American Revolution, invites the repetition of Thao’s ordeal around the nation. A key way to fight back would be lawsuits under the takings clause.

This is not the only kind of serious property damage ICE habitually engages in, though. From Arizona to Maine to Colorado, immigration agents have stopped people’s cars, smashed in windows, dragged out drivers, and left cars running on the street—in effect inviting their theft. In other cases, ICE agents have rammed private vehicles, using a tactic most police departments have banned as too dangerous, to make an arrest.

But there is an explicit constitutional prohibition against the federal government destroying property without “just compensation.” Again, it’s the takings clause. While it’s usually applied when the federal government exercises eminent domain and takes title to land, the takings clause also covers the government’s outright destruction of personal property. What’s more, there are no barriers to recovery akin to qualified immunity.

Applying the takings clause to the destruction of personal property by lawless federal agents makes a certain historical sense. At least one influential legal treatise–writer of the founding period, St. George Tucker, opined that the takings clause had been threaded into the Bill of Rights as a response to the military destruction of personal property during the Colonial-era wars. If Thao or other victims of ICE brought suit, that is, they’d arguably be walking in hallowed footprints.

Would courts be willing to entertain these claims today? Some courts of appeals have dismissed takings claims against state and local police on the theory that the takings clause only applies when government takes title to land. This is flat wrong. For example, the Supreme Court has held that a federal regulation requiring a raisin farmer to destroy a portion of his crop is a per se taking. The government destruction of things, that is, counts as a taking.

Other courts, more plausibly, have held that a takings claim can be brought only when a police officer is acting unreasonably in destroying property. In Thao’s case, and many others, agents’ claim that they are acting “reasonably” would be thwarted by body-cam footage, or the fact that their tactics violate well-established policing practices, such as don’t ram a suspect’s car to get it off the road. Indeed, there are now a trail of court victories on behalf of people whose houses have been damaged by SWAT raids.

If there was any doubt about such claims, it should be extinguished by the fact that Congress has identified precisely how such cases can be brought. It has designated the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as the right tribunal for takings claims over $10,000. Smaller claims are brought in the relevant district court. In both kinds of cases, federal law establishes a fee-shifting mechanism: A win for a plaintiff means that the government has to pay attorney’s fees. This fee-structure means that takings claims should be available even when litigants lack upfront fees for a lawyer, but have an otherwise strong case.

Property damage is, no doubt, a decidedly venal sin in comparison to the grave violations of civil and human rights for which ICE is responsible. But it is a sad fact that Congress and the courts have made it well-nigh impossible to sue if you are brutalized or injured by ICE—and straightforward to prevail if your personal property is busted up. In a moment of less acute emergency, there are good reasons to fix that topsy-turvy situation. In the bleak midst of ICE’s violent blizzard, we must use every lawful tool at our disposal to hit the brakes on its lawless destruction and desecration of Americans’ homes and lives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, I traveled to Minneapolis to report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence. While there, I documented intense struggles between local residents and federal agents—an important story with deadly consequences. But I also heard constantly about another, equally important story: that of the thousands of immigrants who’ve made Minnesota their home and are trying to survive the federal occupation. Reaching people living in those conditions is difficult, precisely because their well-being depends on them staying out of sight. But after multiple attempts, I was connected with a man who has been hiding in his home for fear of being detained. To protect his identity, privacy, and safety, identifying details have been omitted. What follows is his account, originally told in Spanish, of his time in hiding—and the federal abduction of his son.

The most difficult day of my life was the day they grabbed my son.

I am from Guatemala. I left because economically, there is very little opportunity. Delinquency is high. You work, you get paid very little, and there are people waiting to rob you. I left my wife and my children and came here with my son so I could earn a little more and take care of my family back home.

We’ve lived in Minneapolis for seven years. Before the ICE raids intensified, my life was relaxing but full of work. I worked hard, and left my house knowing I would come back. I could walk outside during the day and at night. I slept for a few hours, made my breakfast, made my lunch to take to work the next day; that’s the life of an immigrant. Sundays were my only day of rest, but even then I worked doing laundry, grocery shopping, going to Walmart, talking to people, getting to know the community.

When I arrived in Minneapolis, it felt like my country. I saw people who looked like me. I got used to the snow, the cold, working in all conditions. We worked hard for a few good months to save, then kept working through the winter anyway.

I used to watch Americans buy a few things—soap, bread, eggs, milk. But Hispanic families? We filled two full carts. We move the economy. We move money here, and we send money back to our families. That’s why it hurts so much to be seen like this now. We are not delinquents. We are hard workers. We work from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sometimes we work with lamps on our foreheads. All to help the families we left behind.

On Jan. 6, we woke up early. I didn’t want to leave the house and go to work that day. I told my son that, but he said he wanted to go. He left around 8:45 in the morning. At 10 a.m., his boss called me and asked, “Where is your son? Have you heard from him?” That’s when my heart dropped.

As a father, I wanted to go out and look for him. I wanted to do everything possible. But seeing how things are, I had to avoid going outside. Later, I was watching the news. I saw a video from detention. I saw my son there, chained by his feet. That’s when I knew. That’s when I realized they had him. That image stays with you.

My son is 36 years old. He is a special-needs person. He doesn’t talk. After suffering a stroke, his tongue is stuck. One of his eyes is dead. He works because he needs to work. Here in Minneapolis, he was in medical therapy, learning how to use his jaw again. He was being treated by a doctor here. This is where we were helping him. This is where he was receiving care.

And suddenly, we knew nothing. They told me he was going to be put on a plane to Guatemala on Jan. 19. Then they said he would be released the next day. Then the day passed, and nothing happened. I called the Guatemalan Consulate. They told me they had sent a lawyer to see him. That was a lie. I called another consulate. They told me he was in Louisiana. Then they said no, now he is in El Paso, Texas.

I haven’t received one call from him. Not one.

Not knowing where your family is, that is the hardest thing. Especially now, with the way they are treating us. They are not treating us like people. They are treating us worse than how people in Guatemala treat animals when they go hunting. They grab you by the throat. They throw you to the ground. They put their knees on your neck. That’s how they are treating us. Like animals.

I see on the news that people have died in detention centers in El Paso. I ask myself, as a father: What is happening to him? Where is my son really? If I have to show his photo on television, in the news, in other countries, I will do it. I will not be quiet.

I have cried bitterly. I have cried in solitude. I have gotten to my knees and prayed to God. Only God can do justice. God is big. God is good. God will help. But my body is not the same body as before. My mind is not the same anymore.

For almost two months now, I have been closed inside my home. I don’t go to work. I don’t go to the store. Every time someone knocks on the door, I ask myself, who is it? There is a lot of tension. There is a lot of fear. We need psychologists to help us with everything that is happening. This isn’t easy. And on top of that, we have to use our little resources for this.

I am an older person. I have cholesterol. I have high blood pressure. I recently suffered from pneumonia. I need medication. I always liked having extra medicine in case of emergencies, so at night I wouldn’t worry. Food is a basic necessity. Thank God, He put angels in my path. People with papers get groceries for me. My church and my pastor help me. People in the community help us get what we can’t go out to get. When you know God, God doesn’t stop providing.

I don’t have a bank account. I save my money in cash for emergencies, because you never know. Every week, you work, you get a check, and you have to decide between food, bills, and sending money to your family. You always put something away, because you never know. God told me to save for difficult times. Difficult times are here.

We got used to the freedoms here. Now there is no liberty. We are isolated. Minneapolis feels like a war zone. People tell you, if you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. What ICE is doing is terrorism. This was a beautiful country. Where did that country go? It hurts to be seen like this now.

If they detain me, I won’t fight. These people have no compassion. They see us as criminals. The president says we are criminals. But we haven’t killed anyone. We came here to work. If the day comes, I will go back to my country. But not this way. Not as a delinquent. One day we may return. But this isn’t the way.

If I could say something to ICE or to President Donald Trump, I would say this: God is the owner of all of this. Not you. God Almighty is the only owner. One day He will come. And I hope they regret everything they are doing right now. Only God is responsible for justice.

As I prepared this story on Tuesday, a local contact texted me with news: “FYI his son arrived in Guatemala today, finally after 20 days of waiting.”

            <h2>Ghost gun legislation casts shadow over 3D printing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/ghost_gun_legislation_3d_printing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">State and federal lawmakers have stepped up their efforts to prevent the creation of 3D printed guns. But Adafruit, a maker of electronics kits, warns that the proposed legislation is so broad it threatens everyone involved in open source manufacturing and technology education.

Recent bills attempting to grapple with this issue include New York&#39;s FY 2026–2027 executive budget bill (S.9005 / A.10005), Washington State House Bills 2320 and 2321, and the 3D Printed Gun Safety Act introduced last June in the US House and Senate.

The renewed enthusiasm for clamping down on 3D printing technology follows allegations that Luigi Mangione killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024, with authorities saying a 3D-printed &quot;ghost gun&quot; recovered after his arrest was consistent with the weapon used.

Adafruit, which previously raised concerns about the Washington State proposals, said on Tuesday that the New York bill is also problematic.

&quot;Buried in Part C is a provision requiring all 3D printers sold or delivered in New York to include &#39;blocking technology,&#39;&quot; the company said in a blog post. &quot;This is defined as software or firmware that scans every print file through a &#39;firearms blueprint detection algorithm&#39; and refuses to print anything it flags as a potential firearm or firearm component.&quot;

This requirement would cover a broad set of manufacturing machinery, Adafruit claims, not just resin-based stereolithography (SLA) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive printers, but also Computer Numerical Control (CNC) mills and &quot;any machine capable of making three-dimensional modifications to an object from a digital design file using subtractive manufacturing.&quot;

Last month, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced the legislative proposals to combat 3D printed and illegal firearms. &quot;From the iron pipeline to the plastic pipeline, these proposals will keep illegal ghost guns off of New York streets, and enhance measures to track and block the production of dangerous and illegal firearms in our state,&quot; she said in a statement.

The New York bill would, among other things, criminalize the intentional sale, distribution, or possession of digital instructions to illegally manufacture a firearm or component parts without a license; require 3D printer makers to implement technology to block their machines from creating firearms and component parts; and require the sale or transfer of any 3D printer to be done in-person.

Several states already have laws that disallow the distribution of digital gun files, according to gun safety group Everytown: &quot;Delaware and New Jersey make it illegal to distribute any files within the state that can be used to program a 3D printer to make a firearm, while California creates a civil cause of action against these actors.&quot;

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. maintains more needs to be done to limit the availability of 3D printed firearms, echoing concerns voiced by federal lawmakers.

Adafruit says the obvious flaw in the New York bill is that &quot;you cannot reliably detect firearms from geometry alone.&quot;

&quot;A firearms blueprint detection algorithm would need to identify every possible firearm component from raw STL/GCODE files, while not flagging pipes, tubes, blocks, brackets, gears, or any of the millions of legitimate shapes that happen to share geometric properties with gun parts,&quot; the company said. &quot;This is a classification problem with enormous false positive and false negative rates.&quot;

The company argues, among other recommended changes, that lawmakers should focus on punishing intent and unlawful behavior rather than the possession of machinery and should drop mandatory file-scanning because it won&#39;t work with open source, offline, or custom workflows.

Surveillance should not be built into our tools, the company contends. Instead, prosecute illegal acts. ®

            <div id="article-text">Workday is laying off about two percent of its staff in a bid to align its people with its “highest priorities,” but at a significant cost to its margins for the quarter and the year, the company announced on Wednesday.

The SaaS-y HR vendor said most of the cuts will be to non-revenue generating roles in its Global Customer Operations team.

The Register sought more details and a company representative referred us to a regulatory filing.

Workday warned costs associated with the layoffs will impact the margins it reveals in its next earnings announcement on Feb. 24.

During its last earnings call in November, Workday said it was executing well against its efficiency goals and expects quarterly GAAP operating margins to come in at 9.5 percent and fiscal year GAAP margins to arrive at eight percent.

Workday said it now expects GAAP operating margins to be 24 to 25 percentage points lower for the quarter and 22 to 23 percentage points lower for its full financial year.

“Workday estimates that it will incur approximately $135 million in charges … consisting of approximately $40 million of future cash expenditures related to severance payments, employee benefits, and related costs and approximately $15 million in non-cash charges for stock-based compensation,” according to the regulatory filing. “The charges also consist of approximately $80 million in non-cash charges related to the impairment of certain office space and long-lived assets.”

As of January 2025, Workday’s global workforce consisted of over 20,400 employees in 34 countries, of which approximately 63 percent were located in the U.S.

Last February, Workday announced plans to cut eight percent of its workforce – around 1,600 jobs. The layoffs announced yesterday could hit about 400 jobs. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI bot takeover of the internet continues apace, and the latest data suggests the surge is being driven less by model-training scrapes and more by the growing use of AI tools as a stand-in for web search.

Tollbit, an outfit that tracks AI bot traffic, said in its latest State of the Bots report that by Q4 2025, there was roughly one AI bot visit for every 31 human visits to a site, up from just one bot visit for every 200 human visits in Q1.

That&#39;s likely a conservative estimate too, says Tollbit, as AI bots just keep getting better at seeming like humans when they navigate a website.

&quot;From the tests we ran … many of these web scrapers are indistinguishable from human visitors on sites,&quot; Tollbit noted. &quot;In light of this, the data below is conservative; it is likely worse than these numbers.&quot;

To further drive home the fact that we&#39;re losing the internet to AI bots, human web traffic is also on the decline, Tollbit noted in its data. From Q3 to Q4 of 2025, the company noted, human visitors to websites declined by five percent.

It seems like just yesterday that the biggest concern about AI taking over the web had to do with firms sucking up every piece of content they could find to train their bots with. That&#39;s still going on - as evidenced by all the copyright cases being fought in courts - but training scrapers are no longer the reason for most of the AI bot traffic.

Training scrapes actually dropped by 15 percent between Q2 and Q4 of last year, Tollbit noted. Instead of scraping to develop models, bot traffic is being dominated by retrieval augmented generation (RAG) bots, which are what companies like OpenAI, Google, and others use to extract real-time information from the web to answer queries put to ChatGPT, Gemini, and the like.

RAG bot traffic increased by 33 percent in the same period that training bot traffic declined. AI search indexers, which build indexes used by RAG bots, also saw traffic increase by 59 percent in the same period.

Unsurprisingly, the heaviest scraping activity is attributed to OpenAI. Per Tollbit, ChatGPT-User, the company&#39;s RAG bot, averages five times as many scrapes per page as the second highest scraper, which comes from Meta.

If it&#39;s not clear what that means, it&#39;s that humans are abandoning the internet and letting bots pull and collate information for them at an increasing rate.

According to marketing firm Eight Oh Two, 37 percent of active AI users now start their searches in AI platforms like ChatGPT or Gemini rather than turning first to Google or other traditional search engines. Pew Research found that 62 percent of US adults use AI in some form at least several times a week, suggesting that, if it&#39;s not gaining traction in the enterprise, consumers are at least lapping it up.

Tollbit said that B2B and professional websites, national news, and lifestyle content are the most AI-scraped sites, though the highest increase in scraping since Q2 of last year was seen in the tech and consumer electronics space, which jumped by 107 percent. The second-highest increase, B2B and professional, rose just 62 percent.

&quot;This growth is likely to be driven by a corresponding increase in relevant prompts on consumer AI applications that stems from more users turning to these tools for information retrieval tasks,&quot; Tollbit noted.

AI users driving the RAG surge aren&#39;t exactly checking their references. The already abysmal referral traffic from AI apps to the sites they source is also on the decline, Tollbit said, and dramatically.

From 0.8 percent in Q2 2025, clickthrough rates from AI apps fell to just 0.27 percent in Q4, a decline of nearly threefold. Tollbit noted that websites with AI licensing deals aren&#39;t being insulated from this either, with their clickthrough rates dropping to just 1.33 percent in Q4 - a 6.5x decrease from earlier in the year.

What that means for the future of the internet, according to Tollbit cofounder and chief operating officer Olivia Joslin, is clear: The internet may soon not be a place for us meatbags.

&quot;AI traffic will continue to surge and replace direct human visitors to sites,&quot; Joslin told The Register in an email. &quot;Ultimately, AI will become the primary reader of the Internet.&quot;

Joslin further predicted that, at the rate human traffic is declining and bot traffic is increasing, the internet could become a bot-first operation in short order.

&quot;It could be this year that we see AI visitors being the dominant visitors to publisher sites,&quot; Joslin estimated.

Unfortunately for publishers, Joslin sees the shift from human to bot dominance online as inevitable.

&quot;AI is terrific at answering our questions and enabling us to complete deep research; it&#39;s inescapable,&quot; she noted. &quot;AI visitors read far more than human visitors; they don&#39;t get tired, and they can do far deeper research, while we get bored after looking at the third link.&quot;

&quot;The odds are very much stacked against publishers,&quot; Joslin told us.

The future might not be great for AI users, either.

Some studies suggest that AI use has a direct negative impact on critical thinking and skills. Young people are frequent users of it despite mental health warnings, and studies of students found that those relying on AI for help writing essays showed poorer knowledge retention than those doing the legwork on their own.

Warnings of an AI-fueled intellectual crisis don’t even touch on the fact that AI is yet another level of curation on top of search engine result algorithms that affect what sort of information gets delivered to users and in what format.

So here we are, yet again, with more data suggesting the current iteration of the internet is dying. This time, however, it seems we need to point the finger at the internet users who are gladly sacrificing it on the altar of convenience that is the AI chatbot. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On paper, Positron&#39;s next-gen Asimov accelerators, no doubt named for the beloved science fiction author, don&#39;t look like much of a match for Nvidia&#39;s Rubin GPUs.

Yet, the Arm-backed AI startup boasts its inference chip will churn out five times as many tokens per dollar while using one-fifth the power of Nvidia&#39;s latest accelerators to do it.

Those are certainly some bold claims, which the company contends are possible because the chip was designed to support large-scale inference workloads. Another $230 million of fresh capital probably doesn&#39;t hurt either.

Positron&#39;s Asimov couldn&#39;t be more different from the GPUs popularized by Nvidia and Arm.

Unlike its prior generation Atlas systems, which used high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the Asimov uses LPDDR5x memory, which can be expanded using Compute Express Link (CXL) from 864GB to 2.3TB per chip. Higher memory capacity means more room for LLM parameters and the key-value caches used to keep track of the model state.

But while LPDDR5x is both cheaper and higher capacity than HBM, it&#39;s also glacially slow by comparison.

Nvidia&#39;s newly announced Rubin GPUs pack 288GB of HBM4 good for 22 TB/s of peak bandwidth. By comparison, Asimov appears to top out at around 3 TB/s. The difference, the company claims, is its chips can actually saturate 90 percent of that bandwidth, while GPUs are lucky to hit 30 percent in the real world.

However, that stat appears only to apply to the on-package LPDDR5x memory. Any CXL memory expansion is going to be limited by the chip&#39;s 32 PCIe 3.0 lanes, which are enough for about 256 GB/s of bandwidth. From what we gather, Positron aims to use this CXL memory pool to store key-value caches (KV-Cache), something that in theory should mitigate much of the complexity and overhead of KV-Cache offloading.

We&#39;ll note that even if Positron&#39;s assertion that HBM-based GPUs only manage about 30 percent of peak bandwidth is true, Rubin&#39;s memory is still about 2.4x faster. And that&#39;s not even taking into consideration compute, something that Positron seems to have glossed over in its marketing materials.

The company claims the 400-watt chip features a 512x512 systolic array running at 2 GHz that&#39;ll support the TF32, FP16/BF16, FP8, NVFP4, and Int4 datatypes. This array is fed by a series of Armv9 cores, and can be reconfigured to something like 128x512 or 512x128 depending on which is more advantageous for the task at hand. But if you were hoping for a teraFLOPS figure, we&#39;ve yet to see one.

Having said that, raw compute is only one piece of the puzzle. Few generative AI models are designed to run efficiently on a single chip. As we&#39;ve seen time and time again with chips like Google&#39;s TPU or Amazon&#39;s Trainium, per chip performance is often less important than how efficiently they can scale.

Each Asimov accelerator will be equipped with 16 Tbps of chip-to-chip bandwidth. That works out to 2 TB/s, which means the interconnect is nearly as fast as the memory.

Four Asimov chips will form Positron&#39;s Titan compute platform. But rather than a standalone system, these machines are a lot more like the compute blades in Nvidia&#39;s NVL72 racks. The AI startup claims that up to 4,096 Titan systems can be combined into a single scale-up domain with more than 32 petabytes of memory on board.

This is achieved using a pure chip-to-chip mesh rather than the switched scale-up fabrics we see in Nvidia or AMD&#39;s rack-scale architectures. In this respect, Positron&#39;s scale-up fabric is really more akin to Amazon&#39;s Trainium 2 clusters or Google&#39;s TPUs, which use a variety of rings and 2D and 3D torus topologies.

While this approach eliminates the need for power-hungry packet switches, these meshes aren&#39;t easily reconfigured. Google has gotten around this using optical circuit switches, which function a bit like a telephone switchboard to physically change the way chips connect to one another or to swap in fresh accelerators in the event of a failure. Amazon, meanwhile, has embraced switched fabrics with Trainium 3, arguing it offers better scalability for inference workloads.

Positron hasn&#39;t said how it plans to handle cluster provisioning just yet, but it doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll have to wait long to find out. Asimov is expected to begin shipping next year. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A digital intruder broke into an AWS cloud environment and in just under 10 minutes went from initial access to administrative privileges, thanks to an AI speed assist.

The Sysdig Threat Research Team said they observed the break-in on November 28, and noted it stood out not only for its speed, but also for the &quot;multiple indicators&quot; suggesting the criminals used large language models to automate most phases of the attack, from reconnaissance and privilege escalation to lateral movement, malicious code writing, and LLMjacking - using a compromised cloud account to access cloud-hosted LLMs.

&quot;The threat actor achieved administrative privileges in under 10 minutes, compromised 19 distinct AWS principals, and abused both Bedrock models and GPU compute resources,&quot; Sysdig&#39;s threat research director Michael Clark and researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a blog post about the cloud intrusion. &quot;The LLM-generated code with Serbian comments, hallucinated AWS account IDs, and non-existent GitHub repository references all point to AI-assisted offensive operations.&quot;

The attackers initially gained access by stealing valid test credentials from public Amazon S3 buckets. The credentials belonged to an identity and access management (IAM) user with multiple read and write permissions on AWS Lambda and restricted permissions on AWS Bedrock. Plus, the S3 bucket also contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data for AI models, which would come in handy later during the attack.

To prevent this type of credential theft, don&#39;t leave access keys in public buckets. Sysdig recommends using temporary credentials for IAM roles, and for organizations that insist on granting long-term credentials to IAM users, make sure you rotate them periodically.

After unsuccessfully trying usernames such as &quot;sysadmin&quot; and &quot;netadmin&quot; typically associated with admin-level privileges, the attacker ultimately achieved privilege escalation through Lambda function code injection, abusing the compromised user&#39;s UpdateFunctionCode and UpdateFunctionConfiguration permissions:

They replaced the code of an existing Lambda function named EC2-init three times, iterating on their target user. The first attempt targeted adminGH, which, despite its name, lacked admin privileges. Subsequent attempts eventually succeeded in compromising the admin user frick.

The security sleuths note that the comments in the code are written in Serbian - likely indicating the intruder&#39;s origin - the code itself listed all IAM users and their access keys, created access keys for frick, and listed S3 buckets along with their content.

Plus, the attacker&#39;s code contained &quot;comprehensive&quot; exception handling, according to the security sleuths, including logic to limit S3 bucket listings and an increase to the Lambda execution timeout from three seconds to 30 seconds.

These factors, combined with the short time from credential theft to Lambda execution, &quot;strongly suggest&quot; the code was written by an LLM, according to the threat hunters.

Next, the miscreant set about collecting account IDs and attempting to assume OrganizationAccountAccessRole in all AWS environments. Interestingly, they included account IDs that did not belong to the victim organization: two with ascending and descending digits (123456789012 and 210987654321), and one ID that appeared to belong to a legitimate external account.

&quot;This behavior is consistent with patterns often attributed to AI hallucinations, providing further potential evidence of LLM-assisted activity,&quot; Clark and Brucato wrote.

In total, the attacker gained access to 19 AWS identities, including six different IAM roles across 14 sessions, plus five other IAM users. And then, with the new admin user account they had created, the crims snarfed up a ton of sensitive data: secrets from Secrets Manager, SSM parameters from EC2 Systems Manager, CloudWatch logs, Lambda function source code, internal data from S3 buckets, and CloudTrail events.

They then turned to the LLMjacking part of the attack to gain access to the victim&#39;s cloud-hosted LLMs. For this, they abused the user&#39;s Amazon Bedrock access to invoke multiple models including Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Amazon Nova Premier, Amazon Titan Image Generator, and Cohere Embed.

Sysdig notes that &quot;invoking Bedrock models that no one in the account uses is a red flag,&quot; and enterprises can create Service Control Policies (SCPs) to allow only certain models to be invoked.

After Bedrock, the intruder focused on EC2, querying machine images suitable for deep learning applications. They also began using the victim&#39;s S3 bucket for storage, and one of the scripts stored therein looks like it was designed for ML training - but it uses a GitHub repository that doesn&#39;t exist, suggesting an LLM hallucinated the repo in generating the code.

While the researchers say they can&#39;t determine the attacker&#39;s goal - possibly model training or reselling compute access - they note that the script launches a publicly accessible JupyterLab server on port 8888, providing a backdoor to the instance that doesn&#39;t require AWS credentials.

However, they terminated the instance after five minutes for unknown reasons.

This is the latest in examples of attackers increasingly relying on AI to help them at almost every stage in the attack chain, and some security chiefs have warned that it&#39;s just a matter of time before criminals can fully automate attacks at scale.

There are things organizations can do to defend against similar intrusions and most involve hardening identity security and access management. First off: apply principles of least privilege to all IAM users and roles.

Sysdig also recommends restricting UpdateFunctionConfiguration and PassRole permission in Lambda, limiting UpdateFunctionCode permissions to specific functions and assigning them only to identities that need code deployment capabilities to do their jobs.

Also, make sure S3 buckets containing sensitive data, including RAG data and AI model artifacts, are not publicly accessible.

And it&#39;s a good idea to enable model invocation logging for Amazon Bedrock to detect unauthorized usage.

We reached out to Amazon for comment, but they said they wouldn&#39;t be able to get us anything by publication time. We&#39;ll update this story with any relevant information we receive from them. ®

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has taken the high road by committing to keep its Claude AI model family free of advertising.

&quot;There are many good places for advertising,&quot; the company announced on Wednesday. &quot;A conversation with Claude is not one of them.&quot;

Rival OpenAI has taken a different path and is planning to present promotional material to its free and Go tier customers.

With its abjuration of sponsorship, Anthropic is leaning into its messaging that principles matter, a market position reinforced by recent reports about the company&#39;s clash with the Pentagon over safeguards.

&quot;We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users&#39; interests,&quot; the company said. &quot;So we&#39;ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won&#39;t see &#39;sponsored&#39; links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude&#39;s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.&quot;

That choice may follow in part from how Anthropic&#39;s customer base, and its path toward possible profitability, differ from rivals.

Anthropic has focused on business customers. According to The Information, &quot;The vast majority of Anthropic&#39;s $4.5 billion in revenue last year stemmed from selling access to its AI models through an application programming interface to coding startups Cursor and Cognition, as well as other companies such as Microsoft and Canva.&quot;

For OpenAI, on the other hand, 75 percent of its revenue comes from consumers, according to Bloomberg. And given the rate at which OpenAI has been spending money – an expected $17 billion in cash burn this year, up from $9 billion in 2025, according to The Economist – ad revenue looks like a necessity.

Other major US AI companies – Google, Meta, Microsoft (to the extent its technology can be disentangled from OpenAI), and xAI – all have substantial advertising operations. (xAI, which acquired X last year, absorbed the social media company&#39;s ad business, said to have generated about $2.26 billion in 2025, according to eMarketer.)

Anthropic&#39;s concern is that serving ads in chat sessions would introduce incentives to maximize engagement. And that might get in the way of making the chatbot helpful and might undermine trust – to the extent people trust error-prone models deemed dangerous enough to need guardrails.

&quot;Users shouldn&#39;t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable,&quot; the AI biz said.

The incentive to undermine privacy is what worries the Center for Democracy and Technology.

&quot;Business models based on targeted advertising in chatbot outputs, for example, will create incentives to collect as much user information as possible, including potentially from the highly personal conversations some users have with chatbots, which inexorably will raise risks to user privacy,&quot; the advocacy group said in a recent report.

Melissa Anderson, president of Search.com, which offers a free, ad-supported version of ChatGPT for web search, told The Register in a phone interview that she disagrees with Anthropic&#39;s premise that an AI service can&#39;t be neutral while serving ads.

&quot;They&#39;re kind of saying it&#39;s one or the other and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;And here&#39;s a great example: The New York Times sells advertising. The Wall Street Journal sells advertising. And so I think what they&#39;re conflating is the concept that maybe advertisers are gonna somehow spoil the editorial content.&quot;

At Search.com and at some of the other large LLMs, she said, there&#39;s a commitment to the natural, organic LLM answer not being affected by advertisers.

Anthropic&#39;s view, she said, is valid but extreme. &quot;The advertising industry for a long time has recognized that having too many ads is definitely a bad thing,&quot; she said. &quot;But it&#39;s possible in a world where there&#39;s the right volume of ads, and those ads are relevant and interesting and helpful to the consumer, then it&#39;s a positive thing.&quot;

Iesha White, director of intelligence for Check My Ads, a non-profit ad watchdog group, took the opposite view, telling The Register in an email, &quot;We applaud Anthropic&#39;s decision to forgo an ad-supported monetization model.

&quot;Anthropic&#39;s recognition of the importance of its role as a true agent of its users is both refreshing and innovative. It puts Anthropic&#39;s trust-centered approach in stark contrast to its peers and incumbents.&quot;

Other AI companies, she said, pointing to Meta, Perplexity, and ChatGPT, have chosen to adopt an ad monetization model that, by design, depends upon user data extraction.

&quot;This data - including people&#39;s deepest thoughts, hopes, and fears -  is then packaged to sell ads to the highest bidders,&quot; said White. &quot;Anthropic has recognized that an ad-supported model would create incentives that undermine user trust as well as the company&#39;s own broader vision. Anthropic&#39;s choice reminds one of Google&#39;s original but now jettisoned motto, &#39;Don&#39;t be evil.&#39; Let&#39;s hope that Anthropic&#39;s resolve to do right by its customers is stronger than Google&#39;s was.&quot; ®

Valve says it has to ‘revisit’ its shipping schedule and pricing plans for the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller.

When Valve first announced its impressive-looking Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller hardware in November, the company said the products would begin shipping in early 2026. Some journalists were told “Q1 2026” specifically. But because of the ongoing memory and storage crunch, that launch has been delayed to sometime in the first half of this year, and Valve says it will reset expectations for how much they will cost “as soon as possible.”

“We planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve says in a new post. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”

Valve says that its goal of “shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change.”

When The Verge and other outlets met with Valve to preview the new hardware, the company remained mostly vague about pricing at the time — one of the most important questions if these devices would compete with game consoles rather than PCs. From the beginning, Valve told us the Steam Machine, its ambitious new console, would be “positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space.” For the Frame, the company said it was aiming for a price that was less than its previous headset, the Index, which cost $999. And for the Steam Controller, Valve said it was targeting a price that would be competitive with other controllers with “advanced inputs.”

But within days of Valve’s hardware announcements last November, it became clear that Valve would have a tough time offering competitive pricing with the cost of RAM shooting up. It told Tom’s Hardware that the console was tough to price because “the market is kind of weird” and “memory prices are going up like right as we speak.” As of early 2026, PC gamers have seen the price of RAM triple, even quadruple, as memory makers pour their supply into the more profitable AI server realm.

Yesterday, AMD CEO Lisa Su said on an earnings call that “From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year.” It seems that the words “from a product standpoint” were carrying a lot more weight than we thought.

YouTube’s annual revenue ballooned past $60 billion in ads and subscriptions.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has earned more than $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time. The company announced the milestone as part of its Q4 2025 earnings report released on Wednesday, which highlights the 15 percent year-over-year increase as its cloud business and YouTube continue to grow.

As noted in the earnings report, Google’s Cloud business reached a $70 billion run rate in 2025, while YouTube’s annual revenue soared beyond $60 billion across ads and subscriptions. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that YouTube remains the “number one streamer,” citing data from Nielsen. The company also now has more than 325 million paid subscribers, led by Google One and YouTube Premium.

In addition to surging revenue and subscribers, Google reported that its Gemini AI app surpassed 750 million users following the launch of its Gemini 3 model in November, marking a 100 million increase. Gemini 3 continues to dominate the AI industry, with a custom version of the AI model set to power a more personalized version of Apple’s Siri.

Additionally, Pichai noted that Google Search saw more usage over the past few months “than ever before,” adding that daily AI Mode queries have doubled since launch. Google will soon take advantage of the popularity of its Gemini app and AI Mode, as it plans to build an agentic checkout feature into both tools.

            <div id="article-text">Waymo and Tesla urged lawmakers to pass legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles or risk getting lapped by China. But the senators didn’t sound like they were any closer to an agreement.

Waymo and Tesla urged lawmakers to pass legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles or risk getting lapped by China. But the senators didn’t sound like they were any closer to an agreement.

During a two-hour hearing in the US Senate Wednesday, top executives from Waymo and Tesla urged lawmakers to take action on long-stalled legislation to speed the deployment of self-driving cars on public roads. But after two hours of Q&A around a number of hot-button topics, including robotaxi safety, legal liability, remote operation, and China, it was clear that lawmakers were no closer to passing any bill related to autonomous vehicles.

Waymo faced questions about its decision to use a Chinese-made vehicle for its next-generation robotaxi, as well as several incidents in which its vehicles failed to stop behind a school bus during student pickups. Tesla was asked about its decision to remove radar from its vehicles, its position on binding arbitration, and its misleading marketing around its autonomous features. And officials from both companies were asked whether they believed that the US was at risk of being overtaken by China without a national framework regulating autonomous vehicles. Naturally, they agreed.

“For America to lead in AV technology, we must modernize regulations that inhibit the industry’s ability to innovate,” Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering at Tesla, said during his opening statement. “Federal regulations for vehicles have not kept up with the pace of the rapid evolution of technology. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements, such as electric drive trains, automated driving systems, and over-the-air software updates. We need American leadership for AV rules and regulations.”

But whether Congress can finally pass legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles remains uncertain. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and oversaw today’s hearing, said he thinks it can be done as part of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act, which covers federal funding for highways, transit, and safety programs.

Given the nature of the questions during the hearing, lawmakers remain divided over the potential benefits of driverless cars — and the companies operating them.

“Safety” was the watchword of the hearing. Representatives from Waymo and Tesla both said it was their guiding principle. And several senators agreed that the roads would be safer with more autonomous vehicles on the road.

But both companies were grilled over specific safety lapses involving their vehicles. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) said that any federal legislation would need to address Tesla’s deceptive marketing practices.

“Tesla was allowed to market their technology, which they knew needed human supervision, as Autopilot because there were no federal guardrails,” she said.

But whether the federal government is up to the task is an open question, Cantwell added, noting that under Elon Musk’s DOGE, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lost 25 percent of its employees, leaving the Office of Automation at one point with only four staff members. That has resulted in less enforcement: NHTSA initiated significantly fewer recall investigations in 2025 compared to previous years, she noted.

“Are we going to just continue to let people die in the United States?” Cantwell asked. “Without strong federal oversight, it’s no wonder states are seeking to fill the void.”

Meanwhile, Waymo’s failure to stop during school bus operations in Austin, Texas, and the recent incident in which a robotaxi struck a child at low speed in Santa Monica, California, came up during the hearing.

Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said the company is collecting data across different lighting patterns and conditions, integrating those learnings into its system, to help prevent these incidents from happening again. And he noted that Waymo safely navigates thousands of school bus encounters every week without incident. What Peña didn’t mention, though, was that Waymo’s vehicles were recorded illegally passing stopped school buses even after issuing a software update meant to address the problem.

Binding arbitration, in which companies force customers to resolve disputes in courts that favor the company, was also raised during the hearing. Cantwell said she would not support legislation that barred injured parties from suing robotaxi companies.

She was joined from across the aisle by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), who expressed concern about driverless car companies relying on lengthy terms and conditions or arbitration clauses to limit accountability. He pressed Waymo’s Peña on the issue, who deflected by explaining it wasn’t his area of expertise.

Moreno also pressed the witnesses over legal liability when a driverless vehicle crashes. Both Peña and Moravy said their respective companies would accept liability in incidents where the technology was at fault.

Bryant Walker Smith, a professor in the University of South Carolina’s law and engineering schools who specializes in emerging transportation technologies, was also on the witness panel. He said that NHTSA historically has played a role in changing industry culture by confronting companies that continued to promote defective technologies, such as faulty airbags, and forcing a cultural shift.

The threat posed by China came up numerous times during the hearing, with Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association CEO Jeff Farrah warning legislators that China could become the “global leader” in autonomous vehicles without congressional action.

China became a sticking point for Waymo, too, when Moreno quizzed Peña on the Alphabet-owned company’s decision to use a Chinese-made vehicle for its next-generation robotaxi platform. Current US law prohibits the import of any vehicle with autonomous or connectivity software that originates from China. But Peña explained that the Geely-made vehicles are stripped of all their software before they arrive in the US. Waymo installs all the autonomy software itself, and there is no data sharing with anyone outside the US.

“So giving a natural market to a Chinese company to ship us cars is making us better and creating more jobs for Americans?” the senator said. “That’s completely ridiculous.”

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) brought up the issue of remote operators, which can occasionally help robotaxis navigate tricky situations. Markey pressed Peña on the location of Waymo’s operators, and Peña responded that while some are based in the United States, others are located abroad, specifically in the Philippines. Peña was unable to provide a percentage breakdown, which Markey criticized as alarming given the safety-critical nature of the role.

Markey also raised concerns about latency, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the broader implications of shipping remaining human jobs overseas while replacing domestic drivers with automation. He called the idea of “transatlantic backseat drivers” both dangerous and unacceptable.

He also criticized Tesla for failing to put geographic limitations on its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, arguing that the company is failing to follow the best practices of every other AV company.

“Tesla is putting American lives at risk,” Markey fumed. “And that is unconscionable.”

            <div id="article-text">﻿The Switch peripheral is a well-built piece of nostalgia, but its games are just too stuck in the past.

﻿The Switch peripheral is a well-built piece of nostalgia, but its games are just too stuck in the past.

Though the Virtual Boy was both a commercial and critical failure, the console’s infamy is part of what has made it such a fascinating piece of Nintendo’s history. Original units are still going for hundreds of dollars on bidding sites, and hobbyists have spent years keeping the Virtual Boy alive through emulation and homebrew games. For a long while, it seemed like Nintendo wanted nothing more than for the public to forget that the Virtual Boy ever existed. But over time, the company has become more comfortable acknowledging and even joking about the system through references in games like Super Smash Bros. Melee, Tomodachi Life, and Luigi’s Mansion 3.

Looking back on the Nintendo 3DS and more recent experiments like the Nintendo Switch and Labo, it wasn’t exactly surprising to learn that the Virtual Boy was being resurrected as a Switch peripheral designed to be used while playing classic Virtual Boy games on Nintendo Switch Online. There’s a nifty poetry to Nintendo’s worst-selling console being reimagined as a fancy peripheral for its most successful system of all time. Everything about the new Virtual Boy’s release speaks to Nintendo being confident enough to revisit one of its biggest failures and turn it into a flex that is quite literally designed to prop up the Switch family of consoles.

When I recently spent some time playing with the new Virtual Boy, though, Nintendo’s confidence in this $100 side quest didn’t feel entirely justified. The headset / stand combo is a gorgeous piece of retro tech that’s comfortable enough to shove your face into. And even though I was kind of hoping to experience some disorienting visual weirdness, the console’s stereoscopic lenses didn’t leave me with a headache. But there’s a clunkiness to the way the Virtual Boy’s games played that made the device feel more like an aged novelty rather than a system I could see myself spending some serious time with.

The major selling point to this thing is that it’s faithfully re-creating aspects of the original console that worked while smoothing over some of the roughness that led to it flopping in the ’90s. But if retro nostalgia isn’t really your jam, you might want to pass on the plastic model and consider dusting off your old Labo kit.

As someone who never played the original Virtual Boy and tends to find VR headsets uncomfortable to wear, I was pleasantly surprised at how well my face fit into the new peripheral, which is meant to stand on a table and be used with a controller after you insert your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it. Unlike my cardboard Labo headset — which was prone to letting external light leak in — the plastic Virtual Boy was able to plunge me into total darkness while I was sitting in a well-lit event space.

That darkness made the redness — which can be customized to other colors — of the Virtual Boy’s monochromatic game selection screen pop as I browsed through the limited library of 3D titles. Nintendo says that by the end of this year, it plans to release 14 different Virtual Boy games through its Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription package, which costs $50 a year for individual accounts and $80 for family plans. The first batch of Virtual Boy games is due out on February 17th when the $100 peripheral and its cheaper $25 cardboard counterpart are being released.

During my time with the Virtual Boy, I found myself charmed but a little underwhelmed while playing games like Galactic Pinball, Teleroboxer, and a new port of The Mansion of Innsmouth — a title that had previously only been released in Japan. The games ran perfectly fine and looked like what you would expect from a point in Nintendo’s history when it was experimenting with a new way to make its games feel immersive. As impressive as this lens technology might have been when the original Virtual Boy was released, it pales in comparison to what Nintendo managed to accomplish with the 3DS, and it never managed to fully trick my eyes into thinking that I was playing a game in 3D.

Ironically, it was more aesthetically simplistic games with vector graphics like 3-D Tetris and Red Alarm that felt like they were really pulling me in with their novel approach to presenting three-dimensional space. There’s also something to be said for the fact that playing these games in any form has become much more difficult over the years. This new peripheral might not exactly set off a new wave of Virtual Boy game preservation, but it will make them infinitely more accessible — especially for folks who weren’t around during the original console’s brief lifespan.

Though Nintendo didn’t give me hands-on time with the cardboard Virtual Boy, I came away much more interested in trying that out and seeing what these games might look like on a Labo. The plastic model definitely looks cool and will probably scratch a certain itch for those who wish they’d been able to own a Virtual Boy back in the ’90s. But in 2026, these kinds of 3D games just feel a bit too dated to warrant the price of admission if you aren’t already paying for an NSO subscription.

            <div id="article-text">The OpenAI boss said Anthropic’s portrayal of how ads impact ChatGPT is ‘clearly dishonest.’

The OpenAI boss said Anthropic’s portrayal of how ads impact ChatGPT is ‘clearly dishonest.’

Sam Altman responded to Anthropic’s new Super Bowl ad in an X post on Wednesday, saying the OpenAI competitor’s campaign is “clearly dishonest,” and called it “on brand” for Anthropic to “doublespeak.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” he wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.” You can read his statement in full, below.

Anthropic, founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI research executives who reportedly left over differences in opinions on AI safety and mission, doesn’t mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name in its Super Bowl Sunday ad campaign. But in contrast to OpenAI’s January news that it would soon start testing ads, Anthropic says, “Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

OpenAI says its ad test will only appear for logged-in users on free or ChatGPT Go accounts, while maintaining that “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what’s most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.” According to Altman, OpenAI’s Super Bowl ad is “about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.”

First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.

But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.

I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.

More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don’t show you ads.)

Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.

Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don’t like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can’t use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.

We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.

One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.

As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.

We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.

We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.

This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.

Tech surrenders to the daily chaos of Washington politicking.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the most ambitious crossover event of all time: the infinity war between technology and politics. Not subscribed yet? Come on, do it!

Washington might seem slower than Silicon Valley. But that’s because it’s more turbulent. In order to achieve anything, one has to navigate the sheer amount of chaos that emerges when thousands of federal elected officials, staffers, political appointees, lobbyists, corporations, lawyers, journalists, and influencers are trying to push their interests, often at the same time.

For the past 20-odd issues of Regulator, I’ve written weekly about the big stories in tech’s growing influence in Washington, both as a tool used by politicians to achieve power and as an industry trying to bend the laws in its favor. But over the past year, it’s become harder to declare that there’s only one big story every week. So many new technologies are the subject of heated political debate — semiconductors, artificial intelligence, crypto, social media, surveillance, just to name a few — that to single one out every week seems like it barely scratches the surface of the action happening everywhere in town.

So this week, I’m spilling the notes and plotlines I’ve collected in the course of reporting, as well as some of the most eyebrow-raising stories I’ve come across. Shockingly, even though the District is virtually iced in, and even outside of the partial shutdown, there’s been a lot of action...

Protracted negotiations alert: The House has narrowly voted to avert a partial government shutdown on Tuesday afternoon, but has publicly given its demands for ICE reforms: judge-issued warrants for arrests, enforcement of agents wearing bodycams (a Verge favorite), and making ICE agents remove their masks. The Republicans are countering with a request to revoke funding for “sanctuary cities.” But of course, anything can change in an instant…

Epstein alert: After a testy back-and-forth between their lawyers and the House Oversight Committee, Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify in front of Congress about their relationship with Jeffrey Epstein at the end of the month, narrowly avoiding a vote to hold them in contempt. They also agreed to have their testimonies filmed and transcribed, so prepare your ctrl+F keys to search the DOJ’s Epstein Files database for names dropped.

Celebrity alert: Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt will appear with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the passage of Section 230 in a press conference on Capitol Hill.

On Monday, the White House held a meeting with the policy directors of several major crypto companies, trade associations, and representatives from traditional financial institutions to hammer out an agreement on the Clarity Act. The crypto market structure bill has been in limbo after Coinbase abruptly revoked its support, citing its current language on stablecoin yields. According to a readout from Cody Carbone of The Digital Chamber, a trade association representing the digital asset industry, “the political rhetoric was toned down” and the invited parties eventually agreed to aim for a compromise by the end of February.

Notably, the negotiation was between the policy directors of these institutions, and not the CEOs of those companies — which makes sense, considering reports from Davos. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong got into several confrontations with Wall Street CEOs during the World Economic Forum who were offended that he’d publicly accused traditional banks of sabotaging the bill against the crypto industry. The most Succession-y kerfuffle: JPMorganChase’s Jamie Dimon interrupting Armstrong’s coffee date with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair to accuse him of being “full of shit.” (Personally, I suspect that billionaires prefer fighting in Davos over negotiating in Washington, but that’s just me.)

Semafor reported Friday that Michael Grimes, a longtime Elon Musk associate and banker, is leaving the Trump administration. Since joining the administration in early 2025, Grimes led the Commerce Department’s venture investment arm, which gutted funding for the CHIPS Act, purchased a stake in Intel, and will eventually hold $1 trillion from East Asian trade deals to invest in other tech companies. (The venture is, incidentally, operating without congressional approval.) The division will now be run by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, as well as a group of Wall Street investors, and is currently scouting new potential investment projects.

The Wall Street Journal reports that just days before Donald Trump’s second inauguration, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, an extremely powerful Abu Dhabi royal known as the “spy sheikh,” signed off on a deal to purchase a 49 percent stake in World Liberty Financial — the crypto company owned by the Trump family — for roughly half a billion dollars, paying $187 million upfront to Trump-controlled entities. Shortly thereafter, the United Arab Emirates managed to secure approval to purchase 500,000 advanced AI chips, despite concerns that Tahnoon’s AI firm is slightly too close to the Chinese-owned Huawei for the State Department’s comfort.

Disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on several counts of financial crimes and sentenced to prison, is trying once again to convince people that he’s actually a Republican victim of the “woke mob,” this time making the case on X. (It’s the second time that the former efficient altruist and Dem megadonor has attempted to look redpilled.)

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/04/1131014/from-guardrails-to-governance-a-ceos-guide-for-securing-agentic-systems/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

Why AI companies are betting on next-gen nuclear

AI is driving unprecedented investment for massive data centers and an energy supply that can support its huge computational appetite. One potential source of electricity for these facilities is next-generation nuclear power plants, which could be cheaper to construct and safer to operate than their predecessors.We recently held a subscriber-exclusive Roundtables discussion on hyperscale AI data centers and next-gen nuclear—two featured technologies on the MIT Technology Review 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026 list.

The paints, coatings, and chemicals making the world a cooler place

It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids.But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required. Read the full story.

A brain implant changed her life. Then it was removed against her will.Sticking an electrode inside a person’s brain can do more than treat a disease. Take the case of Rita Leggett, an Australian woman whose experimental brain implant designed to help people with epilepsy changed her sense of agency and self.Leggett told researchers that she “became one” with her device. It helped her to control the unpredictable, violent seizures she routinely experienced, and allowed her to take charge of her own life. So she was devastated when, two years later, she was told she had to remove the implant because the company that made it had gone bust.The removal of this implant, and others like it, might represent a breach of human rights, ethicists say in a paper published earlier this month. And the issue will only become more pressing as the brain implant market grows in the coming years and more people receive devices like Leggett’s. Read the full story.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life.

But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Here’s how biotechnology could help.—Matt Blois

            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <h2>What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/02/1132068/what-weve-been-getting-wrong-about-ais-truth-crisis/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <h2>Europe’s not-so-dry January: Unicorns and a new tech identity</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/europes-not-so-dry-january-unicorns-and-a-new-tech-identity">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.
