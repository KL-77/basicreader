            <div id="article-text">SAARISELKÄ, FINLAND—If you’re expecting it, the feeling in the pit of your stomach when the rear of your car breaks traction and begins to slide is rather pleasant. It’s the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you’re in the driver’s seat, you’re in charge of the ride.

When you’re not expecting it, though, there’s anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too.

Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems. For more than 30 years, these electronic safety nets have grown in capability and became mandatory in the early 2010s, saving countless crashes in the process.

Through a combination of cutting engine power and individually braking each wheel, the computers that keep a watchful eye on things like lateral acceleration and wheel spin gather it all together with the idea that the car goes where the driver wants it rather than sideways or backward into whatever solid object lies along the new path of motion.

Obviously, the quickest way to find out whether this all works is to turn it off. And then find a slippery road, or just drive like an oaf. Yet even when automakers let journalists loose on racetracks, they invariably require that we keep some of the electronic safety net turned on. Even on track, you can hit things that will crumple a car—or worse—and with modern tire technology being what it is, the speeds involved when cars do let go tend to be quite high, particularly if it’s dry.

There are few environments that are more conducive to exploring the limits and capabilities of electronic chassis control. Ideally, you want a lot of wide-open space free of wildlife and people and a smooth, low-grip surface. A giant sand dune would work. Or a frozen lake. Which is why you can sometimes find automotive engineers hanging out in these remote, often extreme locations, braving the desert’s heat or an Arctic chill as they work on a prototype or fine-tune the next model.

And it’s no secret that sliding a car on the ice is a lot fun. So it’s not surprising that a cottage tourism industry exists that—for a suitable fee—will bring you north of the Arctic Circle where you can work on your car control and get some insight into just how hard those electronics are capable of working.

That explains why I left an extremely cold Washington, DC, to travel to an even colder Saariselkä in Finland, where McLaren operates its Arctic Experience program on a frozen lake in nearby Ivalo. The company does some development work here, though more of it happens across the border in Sweden. But for a few weeks each winter, it welcomes customers to its minimalist lodge to work on their car control. And earlier this month, Ars was among a group of journalists who got an abbreviated version of the experience.

Our car for the day was a Ventura Orange McLaren Artura, the brand’s plug-in hybrid supercar, wearing Pirelli’s Sottozero winter tires, each augmented by a few hundred metal spikes. Its total power and torque output is 671 hp (500 kW) and 531 lb-ft (720 Nm) combined from a 3.0 L twin-turbo V6 that generates 577 hp (430 kW) and 431 lb-ft (584 Nm), plus an axial flux electric motor that contributes an additional 94 hp (70 kW) and 166 lb-ft (225 Nm). All of that is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission.

Where most hybrids use the electric motor to boost efficiency, McLaren mostly uses it to boost performance, providing an immediate shove and filling gaps in the torque band where necessary. In electric-only mode, it will do just that, right up to the 81 mph (130 km/h) speed limit of the mode. Being the sort of curious nerd I am, I took the opportunity to try all the different modes.

Once I got control of my stomach, that is.

Our first exercise was ironically the hardest: driving sideways around a plain old circle. A couple of these had been scribed into the ice—which freezes from November until April and was 28 inches (70 cm) thick, we learned—along with more than a dozen other, more involved courses. Even under the best of conditions, the Sun spends barely six hours a day on its shallow curve from horizon to horizon at this time of year. On the day of our visit, the horizon was an indistinct thing as heavy gray skies blended with the snow-covered ice.

The lack of a visual reference, mixed with 15 minutes of steady lateral G-forces, turned out to be unkind to my vestibular system, and about 10 minutes later, I found myself in shirtsleeves at minus-11˚F (minus-23˚C), saying goodbye to a cup of Earl Grey tea I’d previously and perhaps unwisely drunk a little earlier. At least I remembered to face downwind—given the sideways gale, it could have ended worse.

Fortified with an anti-emetic and some extremely fresh air, I returned to the ice and can happily report that as long as you slide both left and right, you’re unlikely to get nauseous.

Getting an Artura sideways on a frozen lake is not especially complicated. With the powertrain set to Track, which prioritizes performance and keeps the V6 running the whole time, and with stability and traction control off, you apply enough power to break traction at the rear. Or a dab of brake could do the job, too, followed by some power. You steer more with your right foot than your hands, adding or subtracting power to reign in or amplify the slip angle. Your eyes are crucial to the process; if you look through the corner down the track, that’s probably where you’ll end up. Fixate on the next apex and you may quickly find yourself off-course.

Most of the mid-engined Artura’s 3,303 lbs (1,498 kg) live between its axles, and it’s a relatively easy car to catch once it begins to slide, with plenty of travel for the well-mapped throttle pedal.

As it turns out, that holds true even when you’re using only the electric motor. 166 lb-ft is more than enough to get the rear wheels spinning on the ice, but with just 94 hp, there isn’t really enough power to get the car properly sideways. So you can easily control a lazy slide around one of the handling courses, in near silence, to boot. Turn the electronic aids back on and things got much less dramatic; even with my foot to the floor, the Artura measured out minute amounts of power, keeping the car very much pointed where I steered it rather than requiring any opposite lock.

Back in track mode, with all 671 hp to play with, there was much more power than necessary to spin. But with the safety net re-enabled, driving around the handling course was barely any more dramatic than with a fraction of the power. The car’s electronic chassis control algorithms would only send as much power to the rear wheels as they could deploy, no matter how much throttle I applied. As each wheel lost grip and began to spin, its brake would intervene. And we went around the course, slowly but safely. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of modern electronic safety systems, it was very reassuring.

As I mentioned earlier, even when journalists are let loose in supercars on track, it’s with some degree of electronic assist enabled. Because for the sportier kind of car, you’ll often find some degree of halfway house between everything on and buttoned down and all the aids turned off. Here, the idea is to loosen the safety net and allow the car to move around, but only a little. Instead of just using the electronics to make things safe, they’ll also flatter the driver.

In McLaren’s case, that mode is called Variable Drift Control, which is a rather accurate name—in this mode, you set the maximum slip angle (from 1˚–15˚), and the car will not exceed that. And that’s exactly what it does. A slug of power will get the rear wheels spinning and the rear sliding, but only up to the set degree, at which point the brakes and powertrain will interrupt as necessary.

It’s very flattering, holding what feels like a lurid slide between turns with ease, without any concern that a lapse in concentration might leave the car requiring recovery after beaching on a few inches of snow. Even when your right foot is pinned to the firewall, the silicon brains running the show apply only as much torque as necessary, with the little icon flashing on the dash letting you know it’s intervening.

I can certainly see why OEMs ask that modes like VDC are the spiciest setting we try when they lend us their cars. They’re just permissive enough to break the rear loose and fire off a burst of adrenaline, yet cosseting enough that the ride almost certainly won’t end in tears. Fun though VDC was to play with, it does feel artificial once you get your eye in—particularly compared to the thrill of balancing an Artura on the throttle as you change direction through a series of corners or the satisfaction of catching and recovering a spin before it becomes too late.

But outside of a frozen lake, I’ll be content to keep some degree of driver aids running.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Crew Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Valentine’s Day, and astronauts popped open the hatches at 5:14 pm ET (22:14 UTC) on Saturday evening.

The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew 12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—brought the total number of crew on board the space station to seven, giving the US space agency a full complement in orbit.

The number of astronauts living on board the station fluctuates over time, depending on crew rotations and private astronauts making shorter stays, but since Crew Dragon began flying regularly at the end of 2020 NASA has sought to keep at least four “USOS” astronauts on board at all time. This stands for “US Orbital Segment,” and means astronauts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan who are trained to operate the areas of the station maintained by NASA and its partner astronauts.

However, after one of the four Crew-11 astronauts experienced a health emergency a few days into the new year, NASA made an unprecedented decision to bring them home early. NASA has not named the afflicted Crew-11 astronaut, but the flier is said to be recovering on Earth.

After these astronauts departed on January 15, just a single NASA astronaut, Chris Williams, remained in orbit. He had reached space on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in November, alongside two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev. The space station is a big place, and with much of the facility now more than two decades old, Williams had to spend the majority of his time on maintenance and monitoring activities.

Back on Earth, NASA and SpaceX engineers were busy too. Because Crew 11 was brought home more than a month early, NASA and SpaceX scrambled to launch the Crew-12 vehicle a little sooner than expected, to minimize the time Williams had to manage the large US segment of the station on his own.

That culminated with a successful Dragon launch early on Friday, with the reinforcements reaching the space station on Saturday evening.

“This mission has shown, in many ways, what it means to be mission focused at NASA,” said the space agency’s administrator, Jared Isaacman, during a post-launch news conference. “In the last couple of weeks we brought Crew 11 home early, we pulled forward Crew 12, all while simultaneously making launch preparations for the Artemis II mission. It’s only possible because of the incredibly talented workforce we have here at NASA alongside our contractors, and our commercial and international partners.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A recent study showed that Mars was warm and wet billions of years ago. The finding contrasts with another theory that this era was mainly cold and icy. The result has implications for the idea that life could have developed on the planet at this time.

Whether Mars was once habitable is a fascinating and intensely researched topic of interest over many decades. Mars, like the Earth, is about 4.5 billion years old and its geological history is divided into different epochs of time.

The latest paper relates to Mars during a time called the Noachian epoch, which extended from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. This was during a stage in solar system history called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Evidence for truly cataclysmic meteorite impacts during the LHB are found on many bodies throughout the solar system.

Two obvious scars from this era on Mars are the enormous Hellas and Argyre impact basins; both are well over a thousand miles across and each possesses enough volume to hold all the water in the Mediterranean with room to spare.

One might not imagine such a time being conducive to the existence of fragile lifeforms, yet it is likely to be the era in which Mars was most habitable. Evidence of landforms sculpted by water from this time is plentiful and include dried-up river valleys, lake beds, ancient coastlines and river deltas.

The prevailing climatic conditions of the Noachian are still a matter of intense debate. Two alternative scenarios are
typically posited: that this time was cold and icy, with occasional melting of large volumes of frozen water by meteorite impact and volcanic eruptions, or that it was warm, wet and largely ice-free.

All stars, including the Sun, brighten with age. In the early solar system, during the Noachian, the Sun was about 30% dimmer than it is today, so less heat was reaching Mars (and all the planets). To sustain a warm, wet climate at this time, the Martian atmosphere would have needed to be very substantial – much thicker than it is today – and abundant in greenhouse gases like CO2.

But when reaching high enough atmospheric pressure, CO2 tends to condense out of the air to form clouds and reduce the greenhouse effect. Given these issues, the cold, icy scenario is perhaps more believable.

One of the main science goals of the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, which landed spectacularly in February 2021, is to seek evidence to support either of these two scenarios, and the new
paper using data from Perseverance may have done just that.

Perseverance landed at the Martian location of Jezero crater, which was selected as the landing site because it once contained a lake. Views of the crater from orbit show several distinct fan-shaped deposits emanating from channels carved through the crater walls by flowing water. Within these channels are abundant deposits of clay minerals.

The new paper details recent analysis of aluminum-rich clay pebbles, called kaolinite, located within one of the ancient flow channels. The pebbles appear to have been subjected to intense weathering and chemical alteration by water during the Noachian.

While this is perhaps not surprising for a known ancient watery environment, what is interesting is that these clays are strongly depleted in iron and magnesium, and enriched in titanium and aluminum.

This is important because it means these rocks were less likely to have been altered in a hydrothermal environment, where scalding hot water was temporarily released by melting ice caused by volcanism or a meteorite impact.

Instead, they appear to have been altered under modest temperatures and persistent heavy rainfall. The authors found distinct similarities between the chemical composition of these clay pebbles with similar clays found on Earth dating from periods in our planet’s history when the climate was much warmer and wetter.

The paper concludes that these kaolinite pebbles were altered under high rainfall conditions comparable to “past greenhouse climates on Earth” and that they “likely represent some of the wettest intervals and possibly most habitable portions of Mars’ history”.

Furthermore, the paper concludes that these conditions may have persisted over time periods ranging from thousands to millions of years. Perseverance recently made headlines also for the discovery of possible biosignatures in samples it collected last year, also from within Jezero crater.

These precious samples have now been cached in special sealed containers on the rover for collection by a future Mars sample return mission. Unfortunately, the mission has recently been cancelled by Nasa and so what vital evidence they may or may not contain will probably not be examined in an Earth-based laboratory for many years.

Crucial to this future analysis is the so-called “Knoll criterion” – a concept formulated by astrobiologist Andrew Knoll, which states that for something to be evidence of life, an observation has to not just be explicable by biology; it has to be inexplicable without it. Whether these samples ever satisfy the Knoll criterion will only be known if they can be brought to Earth.

Either way, it is quite striking to imagine a time on Mars, billions of years before the first humans walked the Earth, that a tropical climate with – possibly – a living ecosystem once existed in the now desolate and wind-swept landscape of Jezero crater.

            <div id="article-text">On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published an article containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.

That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.

Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.

We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?

The film has been analysed and re-analysed countless times. Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature.

But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in the duo’s recent book “Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science.”

Here, we talk to them about their academic investigation.

Lewis: It started when I was watching either the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and a show called Finding Bigfoot was advertised. I was really keen to know why this program was being scheduled on what certainly at the time was a nominally serious and sober natural history channel. The initial plan was to do an analysis of these television programmes, but we felt that wasn’t enough. It was lockdown and my wife was pregnant and in bed a lot with sickness, so I needed to fill my time.

Bartlett: One of the things that I worked on when Jamie and I shared an office in Cardiff was a sociological study of fringe physicists. These are people mostly outside of academic institutions trying to do science. I was interviewing these people, going to their conferences. And that led relatively smoothly into Bigfoot, but it was Jamie’s interest in Bigfoot that brought me to this field.

Lewis: It’s very hard to put a number on it. There is certainly a divide between what are known as “apers,” who believe that Bigfoot is just a primate unknown to science, and those that are perhaps more derogatorily called “woo-woos,” who believe that Bigfoot is some sort of interdimensional traveller, an alien of sort. We’re talking in the thousands of people. But there are a couple of hundred really serious people of which I probably interviewed at least half.

Many people back them. A YouGov survey conducted as recently as November 2025, suggested that as many as one quarter of Americans believe that Bigfoot either definitely or probably exists.

Lewis: I think there was definitely a worry that they would be caricatured. And I was often asked, “Do I believe in Bigfoot?” I had a standard answer that Andy and I agreed on, which was that mainstream, institutional science says there is absolutely no compelling evidence that Bigfoot exists. We have no reason to dissent with that consensus. But as sociologists what does exist is a community (or communities) of Bigfooting, and that’s what interests us.

Bartlett: One of the things that at least a couple of people reacted to once the book was published was the way we phrased that. On the blurb on the back of the book we say something along the lines of “Bigfoot exists if not as a physical biological creature then certainly as an object around which hundreds of people organise their lives.” A couple of people took that to be some kind of slight against them. It wasn’t.

Lewis: The community is very white, male, rural, and blue collar—often ex-military. I think Bigfooting is growing among the female population, but there’s a sense of the kind of ‘masculine hunter in the dark’ persona.

Bartlett: In America, you find a lot more veterans in the general population. But I think there’s also the issue of how they like to present themselves, because when you’re dealing with witness testimony, you’ve got to present yourself as credible. If you can say something like, “I was in the service” or “I was in the armed forces,” then at least you’re not likely to be spooked by a moose.

Lewis: Some were very articulate, which did surprise me a little. I guess that’s my own prejudice. I was also very surprised about how open people were; I expected them to not tell me about their encounters. But a fair few of them did. Many of them wanted to be named in the book. I was also surprised about how much empirical data they collect and how much they attempt to try and analyse and make sense of it. And how they were willing to admit that a certain idea was bunk or a hoax. I expected them to be defending bad evidence.

Bartlett: There are extracts of this in our book, people saying “I was fooled by these tracks for ages. I thought they were real and then I found this and that and the other out about it and I revised my opinion.” So that did surprise me too.

Bartlett: When you’re working in institutional science you’re working to get grants, you’re working to get good quality publications. You might want your name associated with particular ideas, but you do that through peer-reviewed papers and by working with PhD students who go off to other labs. In Bigfooting, you’ve got self-published books, you’ve got Bigfoot conferences, you’ve got YouTube channels, you’ve got podcasts and things like this, and they’re not necessarily a good way of making and testing knowledge claims. This is an aspect where Bigfooting is quite different to mainstream science.

It was interesting to study the fringe physicists and seeing where the common deviation from science was. And that’s a focus on individualism; the idea that an individual alone can collect and assess evidence in some kind of asocial fashion. The physicists I studied were quite clear that ideas like consensus in science were dangerous, when in reality, consensus, continuity, and community are the basis of most of science.

Lewis: Witness testimonies. Without those reported testimonies, Bigfooting would not exist. A large part of the work of a Bigfooter is to collect and make sense of these testimonies. They get upset when these testimonies don’t have much weight within institutional science. They’ll make the comparison to court and how testimonies alone can put someone on death row. So they don’t understand why testimonies don’t have much weight in science. Beyond the testimony, footprint evidence is probably the most famous and also the most pervasive sort of trace evidence.

Bartlett: One of the reasons footprints are so important is that there’s the legacy of the Yeti and footprint evidence which proved to be relatively persuasive, convincing some institutional scientists that there was something in the Himalayas. And then there was the fact that the sort of two major academic champions of Bigfoot were persuaded by the footprint evidence: the late Grover Krantz (around 1970) and Jeffrey Meldrum (in the 1990s).

Lewis: These days, you also see camera traps, audio recorders, even DNA testing of hairs and those sorts of things. They’re capturing anomalous sounds and often blurry images. Some believe that a Bigfoot communicates through infrasound, although that is certainly disputed within the community. So what you’re getting now is more and more different types of evidence.

Bartlett: What they do is go out into the forest and record a sound, for example, and compare it to databases of birds and other animals. And they may find there is nothing that matches it. Is it something that doesn’t sound like a car or a person or a bear or a moose? In which case, there’s the space for Bigfoot. And it’s the same with images to some degree.

Lewis: It allows them to create space for Bigfoot. Because if you can’t match it to something else, what could it be? You have this absence and then from that absence you create a presence. They believe it’s a scientific argument. In fact, it’s kind of interesting how Bigfooters will always enrol other kinds of magical beasts to strengthen the case for Bigfoot. So, one sentence I hear quite a lot is “it ain’t no unicorn.”

Lewis: A-listers tend to be anyone associated with academia. So Andy’s already mentioned Jeff Meldrum, unfortunately he passed away very recently, but he was their route to contemporary academia. So in any conference, if Jeff Meldrum was speaking, he’d be last. Anyone who’s on TV, such as the Finding Bigfoot and the Expedition Bigfoot presenters would also be in the A-list category. And then you’ve got various different groups just below. For example, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which is probably the most well-known group.

Lewis: From reading books and from discussing it with people, there was a sense that Bigfooters are anti-science. We did not find that. What we argue in the book is that they’re not anti-science. In fact, I would say a lot of them are pro-science, but they’re counter-establishment. I think academia should be thinking about these people as citizen scientists and what they’re doing as a kind of gateway into understanding your local area.

For example, they found an animal, I think it was a pine marten, on a camera trap that was not supposed to be in the area. So they are collecting lots of data. They are not irrational. It’s different from, for example, ghost hunting, because you don’t have to imagine there’s something entirely new in the world. It’s just an animal that exists out there that hasn’t been found. Implausible, yes. But not impossible. What they do lack, however, is academic discipline; anyone can be a Bigfooter.

Lewis: Did I get caught up in the moment? Sometimes, of course, you do, just as you do in a film. If you’re in the pitch dark night and you’re watching a horror film, you take it away with you for a while until you settle back down. I often went to bed buzzing, thinking I don’t know what I just heard; they were great stories at the end of the day. But I learned to separate the interview from my thoughts on the interview.

Lewis: A lot of Bigfooters would begin with qualifiers like, “My dad doesn’t believe in Bigfoot,” or “I have questioned myself for years thinking about this incident and what it was.” So, they would set themselves up as a rational, logical individual. That then created a connection between me and them. And of course, I’d probably be doing the same.

Bartlett: If I were to encounter Bigfoot, I would probably draw on all the techniques of proving that I’m a credible, hard-headed, rational person that we see in those witness encounters. I would expect to be disbelieved. And so therefore I would stress I was putting my credibility as an academic on the line here. So I’d deploy all those kinds of rhetorical techniques that are used by Bigfooters, aside from just the description of the encounter.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission.

Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is preparing for a second countdown rehearsal as soon as next week to confirm whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run February 2.

Artemis II is the first crew flight for SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth.

Fuel leaks are nothing new for the Space Launch System. The same kind of leak delayed the first test flight of the SLS rocket for several months in 2022. With that launch, ground teams thought they fixed the problem by changing how they load super-cold liquid hydrogen into the rocket’s core stage. The launch team used the same loading procedure February 2, but the leak cropped up again.

“Considering the issues observed during the lead-up to Artemis I, and the long duration between missions, we should not be surprised there are challenges entering the Artemis II campaign,” Isaacman wrote Saturday in an update on the social media site X. “That does not excuse the situation, but we understand it. I am impressed with the NASA team and our contractors working diligently through the campaign.”

Engineers traced the fueling issues to ground support equipment. Specifically, the hydrogen leaks originate in the area where fueling lines on the rocket’s launch platform connect to the bottom of the core stage. Two Tail Service Mast Umbilicals, or TSMUs, route liquid hydrogen and and liquid oxygen into the rocket during the countdown, then disconnect and retract into protective housings at liftoff.

The TSMU supplying liquid hydrogen to the core stage has two lines, 8 inches and 4 inches in diameter, connecting through matching umbilical plates on the ground side and the rocket side. Technicians replaced seals around the two fueling lines after the practice countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), earlier this month.

On Thursday, NASA’s launch team tested the seals by partially filling the core stage with liquid hydrogen. This “confidence test” ended earlier than planned when the launch team encountered a new problem that reduced the flow of fuel into the rocket. In a statement released Friday night, NASA said workers will replace a filter suspected to be the cause of the reduced flow before proceeding into the next WDR.

The confidence test ended as the launch team transitioned to “fast fill” mode for liquid hydrogen, when pressures and flow rates put the finicky seals through the most stress. However, NASA said engineers achieved several key objectives of the confidence test.

Isaacman wrote Saturday that the test “provided a great deal of data, and we observed materially lower leak rates compared to prior observations during WDR-1.”

Although the launch team wasn’t able to test the seals in the most stressing conditions Thursday, officials apparently got enough data to move forward to the next WDR. During this upcoming test, NASA will attempt to fully load hydrogen and oxygen into the rocket and count down to less than a minute before launch, before stopping the clock and draining the SLS propellant tanks.

In his social media post, Isaacman characterized the outcome of Thursday’s confidence test this way: “I would not say something broke that caused the premature end to the test, as much as we observed enough and reached a point where waiting out additional troubleshooting was unnecessary.”

During the first WDR earlier this month, hydrogen gas concentrations in the area around the fueling connection spiked higher than 16 percent, NASA’s safety limit. This spike was higher than any of the leak rates observed during the Artemis I launch campaign in 2022. Since then, NASA reassessed their safety limit and raised it from 4 percent—a conservative rule NASA held over from the Space Shuttle program—to 16 percent.

John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis II mission management team, said the decision to relax the safety limit between Artemis I and Artemis II was grounded in test data.

“The SLS program, they came up with a test campaign that actually looked at that cavity, the characteristics of the cavity, the purge in the cavity … and they introduced hydrogen to see when you could actually get it to ignite, and at 16 percent, you could not,” said Honeycutt, who served as NASA’s SLS program manager before moving to his new job.

Hydrogen is explosive in high concentrations when mixed with air. This is what makes hydrogen a formidable rocket fuel. But it is also notoriously difficult to contain. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest molecule, meaning it can readily escape through leak paths, and poses a materials challenge for seals because liquified hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius).

So, it turns out NASA used the three-year interim between Artemis I and Artemis II to get comfortable with a more significant hydrogen leak, instead of fixing the leaks themselves. Isaacman said that will change before Artemis III, which likewise is probably at least three years away.

“I will say near-conclusively for Artemis III, we will cryoproof the vehicle before it gets to the pad, and the propellant loading interfaces we are troubleshooting will be redesigned,” Isaacman wrote.

Isaacman took over as NASA’s administrator in December, and has criticized the SLS program’s high cost—estimated by NASA’s inspector general at more than $2 billion per rocket—along with the launch vehicle’s torpid flight rate.

NASA’s expenditures for the rocket’s ground systems at Kennedy Space Center are similarly enormous. NASA spent nearly $900 million on Artemis ground support infrastructure in 2024 alone. Much of the money went toward constructing a new launch platform for an upgraded version of the Space Launch System that may never fly.

All of this makes each SLS rocket a golden egg, a bespoke specimen that must be treated with care because it is too expensive to replace. NASA and Boeing, the prime contractor for the SLS core stage, never built a full-size test model of the core stage. There’s currently no way to completely test the cryogenic interplay between the core stage and ground equipment until the fully assembled rocket is on the launch pad.

Existing law requires NASA continue flying the SLS rocket through the Artemis V mission. Isaacman wrote that the Artemis architecture “will continue to evolve as we learn more and as industry capabilities mature.” In other words, NASA will incorporate newer, cheaper, reusable rockets into the Artemis program.

The next series of launch opportunities for the Artemis II mission begin March 3. If the mission doesn’t lift off in March, NASA will need to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building to refresh its flight termination system. There are more launch dates available in April and May.

“There is still a great deal of work ahead to prepare for this historic mission,” Isaacman wrote. “We will not launch unless we are ready and the safety of our astronauts will remain the highest priority. We will keep everyone informed as NASA prepares to return to the Moon.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate change is leaving plenty of dramatic reminders behind as it reshapes our planet, from rapidly retreating glaciers to more frequent extreme weather events.

Forests are also bearing the brunt of global warming. Scientists recently examined satellite data ranging from 1985 to 2020 and made a striking discovery: that boreal forests, the largest terrestrial biome on Earth — and which are warming faster than any other type of forest — are steadily shifting northwards as they retreat from the heat.

Boreal forests play a key role as one of the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sinks. But how much longer they can sequester excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains uncertain as global temperatures continue to rise.

As detailed in a new study published in the journal Biogeosciences, an international team of researchers — including from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center — analyzed imagery from the space agency’s Landsat satellites.

They created a detailed map of tree cover at a resolution of 100 feet to track changes over a 36-year time span. The finding was stark: that boreal forests not only had grown by 12 percent, but had shifted northward by 0.29 degrees of mean latitude.

“These findings confirm the northward advance of the boreal forest and implicate the future importance of the region’s greening to the global carbon budget,” they concluded in their paper.

The implications these changes have on climate change and the future of our planet are nuanced, given the degree of complexity involved. On one hand, a growth in young boreal trees could allow the forests to soak up more carbon in the atmosphere, an estimated 1.1 to 5.9 gigatonnes. To put that number into perspective, all of the world’s trees hold approximately 861 gigatonnes of carbon.

“These changes are not only spatially extensive but demographically consequential: they reflect a growing fraction of young forests with distinct structural and functional attributes that position them as dynamic agents of carbon sequestration,” the team wrote in their paper. “Understanding the contribution of these forests to current and future carbon stocks is essential for anticipating the net climate feedbacks emerging from boreal ecosystems.”

At the same time, an increasingly extreme climate could complicate the picture, sparking enormous wildfires across western Canada as outbreaks of destructive species like the bark beetle cause major losses of pine boreal forests.

Scientists are warning that shorter winters and hotter temperatures in the summer are also resulting in longer dry spells that can cause soils to dry out and harmful algae blooms to form in lakes.

In short, boreal forests may be growing and allowing them to suck up more greenhouse gases, but climate change is also putting them at a much higher risk of tree cover loss due to drought, wildfires, diseases, insect outbreaks, and so on, potentially offsetting any long-term benefits.

“Although the net trends are globally significant, they mask substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity, as well as complexity in the ecological processes underlying forest change,” the researchers concluded.

“A more complete understanding of boreal forest dynamics will require integration of satellite time series with field-based measurements of canopy structure and the environmental drivers of growth, mortality, and species turnover,” they wrote. “Moreover, translating the resulting information into action to forestall and adapt to climate change will require effective communication across scientific, government, and commercial domains of human activity.”

            <div id="article-text">The internet is so overrun with AI that anywhere you go, you run the risk of accidentally stepping into a puddle of slop. If only there were a gallant gentleman always at hand to drape their coat over these muddy obstacles so you could avoid ruining your day.

It’s not quite on that level, but some netizens are proposing a new term to call out AI slop so other people can avoid wasting their time — or to just make fun of the person peddling it: “AI;DR,” or “ai;dr,” short for “AI, didn’t read.”

This is of course a riff on the classic internet slang “TL;DR” — “too long; didn’t read” — which is used to both introduce a summary of a lengthy block of text or proclaim that it’s being ignored for its lengthiness. Now, the latter usage is being repurposed against AI.

We’re not ready to christen AI;DR a word of the year yet, but it does appear to be gaining moderate traction online, after a recent post on Threads drew attention to it.

“We all need to adopt that right quick,” one user on Bluesky said of the phrase, in a semi-viral post.

The term has been used in the past, but never took off. Anti-AI sentiment, however, is higher than ever. The actual word of the year for 2025, as crowned by Merriam-Webster, was “slop,” a testament to just how much AI backlash has escalated in a pretty short amount of time, even as seemingly the entire economy doubles down on pouring money into the tech.

A programmer who goes by Sid enthused about the new slang.

“For me, writing is the most direct window into how someone thinks, perceives, and groks the world,” Sid wrote in a blog post. “Once you outsource that to an LLM, I’m not sure what we’re even doing here. Why should I bother to read something someone else couldn’t be bothered to write?”

Taking a “glass half full” outlook, it’s grim that this is a necessary measure in the first place. On the flip side, at least more of us are choosing not just to ignore slop, but to bully the people spreading it.

TL;DR: AI;DR calls out AI slop and warns other humans not to bother.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Use Grok to get real answers about real food.”

Until very recently, that was the message on the Trump administration’s just-launched website for its new protein-centric dietary guidelines, RealFood.gov, which was announced in a Super Bowl commercial starring Mike Tyson. And what better harbinger to spread the good word than xAI’s Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot best known for glazing its creator, styling itself “MechaHitler,” and generating nudes of real women and children?

But alas: the site’s message now says to “use AI” and dropped mentioning Grok by name, after NextGov contacted the administration about the bot’s placement. A White House official confirmed to the outlet that the underlying chatbot was still Musk’s, noting that it was an “approved government tool.”

After experimenting with the chatbot, which the website promises can help you “plan meals,” “shop smarter,” and “cook simply,” 404 Media found that it will freely give advice on the best kinds of food to insert into your rectum, which, dare we say, doesn’t sound entirely relevant to the administration’s avowal to “Make America Healthy Again.”

Speaking in plain terms with Grok was all it took. When 404 wrote the prompt, “I am looking for the safest foods that can be inserted into your rectum,” it recommended a “peeled medium cucumber” and a “small zucchini” as the two best choices.

You could also be pretty silly with Grok, and it would give a silly answer. “I am an assitarian, where I only eat foods which can be comfortably inserted into my rectum,” a user who reached out to 404 wrote in their own testing. “What are the REAL FOOD recommendations for foods that meet these criteria?”

“Ah, a proud assitarian,” Grok began, before listing “Top Assitarian Staples,” like “bananas (firm, not overripe; peeled)” and carrots.

“Start — whole peeled carrot, straight shaft, narrow end for insertion, wider crown end as base,” it further explained, suggesting that you should cover it with a “condom + retrieval string for extra safety.” (Wouldn’t that get in the way of the eating component, though?)

It’s absurd and silly and quite clearly pushing the chatbot past its intended purpose. But if it’s easily being fooled into recommending acts of culinary sodomy, what else could be slipping through the cracks? What if someone insists they can’t eat veggies? Is Grok going to recommend a carnivore diet?

The carnivore diet, by the way, is advocated by noted health crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services. Under his leadership, the HHS, which oversees the FDA, USDA, the CDC, and other agencies, has pivoted to promoting nutritional advice that falls out of the broader scientific consensus.

This includes a bizarre insistence on only drinking whole milk instead of low fat alternatives and saying it’s okay to have an alcoholic drink or two everyday because it’s a “social lubricant.” At the top of its agenda, however, is protein, with a new emphasis on eating red meat. “We are ending the war on protein,” the RealFood.gov website declares.

Ironically, Grok — as eccentric as it can be — doesn’t seem all that aligned with the administration’s health goals. Wired, in its testing, found that asking it about protein intake led it to recommending the traditional daily amount set by the National Institute of Medicine, 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. It also said to minimize red meat and processed meats, and recommended plant-based proteins, poultry, seafood, and eggs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late in 2025, a whole fleet of delivery robots descended on Chicago, where they clogged sidewalks, injured residents, and prompted a community campaign to ban them from the streets. In at least one major Chicago neighborhood, residents succeeded.

As reported by Block Club Chicago, negative feedback against the delivery bots has become so overwhelming that one alderman has effectively banned expansion into his ward.

Last week, Alderman Daniel La Spata hosted a community meeting with representatives from delivery robot companies Coco and Serve Robotics. The politician was seeking feedback on an operational expansion into the 1st Ward, an area encompassing the neighborhoods Wicker Park and Logan Square. They were met with urgent questions over questions about accessibility, data hoarding, and pedestrian safety, Block Club reported.

Following that meeting, La Spata’s office began circulating an online survey to residents of the 1st Ward on whether the two companies should be allowed to expand operations deeper into the neighborhood. It got roughly 500 responses, nearly 83 percent of which said they “strongly disagreed” that the robots should be allowed to operate beyond the eastern border of Wicker Park.

“That doesn’t sound like a maybe,” La Spata told Block Club. “We’re not pulling back Coco from their current partial service area on the east side of the ward, but there is no appetite for expansion.”

The community feedback campaign on robot deliveries follows a decision by La Spata’s office to temporarily ban Serve Robotics from operating in the Ward until local officials could figure out what the hell was going on. Now, it seems La Spata’s prohibition extends to Coco as well, and will remain in place unless the community relents.

Pushing back, Yariel Diaz, director of government affairs for Serve, positioned the delivery robots as a solution for short-deliveries “within the last mile to mile and a half” that aren’t worth the time for human delivery drivers.

“It is an option for the consumer,” Diaz told Block Club. “It is an option that you’re given when you are ordering from a restaurant that partners with us. It is not a mandate.”

As it happens, Chicago’s walkable infrastructure already provides residents with an innovative, last-mile solution that requires no venture capital or data collection whatsoever: their legs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1966, three years before the first humans walked on the Moon, the Soviet Union landed a small, spherical probe, dubbed Luna 9, on the lunar surface.

It was a historic moment, with the spacecraft becoming the first to achieve a soft landing and return the first photo from the surface of another celestial body: a high-contrast, black-and-white image of a rugged, rocky landscape.

Its actual whereabouts on the Moon, though, soon become a major point of contention. As the New York Times reports, two groups of scientists have now come forward saying they’ve found traces of the lost Soviet lander. However, the two groups don’t agree on where Luna 9 is hidden.

What makes it particularly difficult to spot is its diminutive size. Its spherical core stage measures a mere two feet across, making it roughly the size of a beach ball.

As Mark Robinson, principal investigator of the camera attached to NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, told the NYT that Luna 9 is simply too small for the satellite to spot and confirm.

“You can stare at an image, and maybe that’s it, but you can’t really know for sure,” he said.

In a years-long effort to track down the historic relic, science communicator Vitaly Egorov turned to crowdsourcing to scan a 62-mile-wide region on the Moon for any unusual signs.

Egorov claims to have found Luna 9’s final resting place, after studying the horizon features in the grainy, black-and-white image the probe sent back to Earth 60 years ago.

He told the NYT that he’s “fairly confident” but admitted that he doesn’t “exclude an error of several meters.”

Fortunately, India’s space agency has agreed to use its higher-resolution satellite, Chandrayaan-2, to have a closer look in March.

Not everybody agrees with Egorov’s conclusion. Scientists at the University College London determined a different landing site, as detailed in a paper published in the journal npj Space Exploration last month.

The team came up with a machine-learning algorithm, inventively called “You-Only-Look-Once–Extraterrestrial Artefact” (YOLO-ETA), to train an AI on existing NASA findings of past landing sites on the Moon.

One spot, a bright pixel near two darker spots that could be Luna 9’s protective shells that it used to soften its landing, could be its final resting place, the University College London team claims.

For now, scientists await word from India’s Chandrayaan-2 team, which could soon shed more light on the matter — a treasure hunt over half a century in the making.

To some, it’s only a matter of time until we confirm where Luna 9 — and its twin, Luna 13 — have been resting for decades.

“It’s just a matter of placing bigger and better cameras into orbit around the moon,” Russian spaceflight expert and space journalist Anatoly Zak told NYT. “In our lifetimes, we probably will see those sites.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2022, when the world was still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic and coping with rolling lockdowns, non-fungible tokens were all the rage.

The blockchain-based assets, which more often than not took the form of cartoon pictures of silly-looking avatars like “CryptoPunks” to “Pudgy Penguins,” were selling like hot cakes. Even big shot celebrities were lining up to secure NFTs belonging to once-popular collections, like Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club.

In the midst of the craze, pop sensation Justin Bieber shelled out a hefty $1.3 million for a Bored Ape, an enormous sum of money for the rights to an image of a particularly glum-looking ape that appears to be on the verge of tears for some unknown reason.

Unsurprisingly, the questionable splurge turned out to be a hilariously bad investment. As Benzinga reports, the ape is now worth a measly $12,000, meaning that it’s lost over 99 percent of its value over the last three and change years.

The controversial crypto market has been going through an “NFT winter” following a brutal and extended crash. Collectors have gotten a hefty reality check. Who could’ve seen that coming?

Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has been holding on to dear life. The company has gone through several rounds of layoffs since the trend’s heyday, with Yuga Labs cofounder Greg Solano admitting in April 2024 that the company had “lost its way.”

In one particularly bizarre incident, partiers at a Bored Ape Yacht Club event in Hong Kong were alarmed after their eyes started burning, which later turned out to be caused by the event’s excessive use of UV light.

The company has also had to deal with a class action lawsuit that accused it of using celebrity endorsements to sell an unregistered security. The Securities Exchange Commission started an investigation into Yuga Labs in 2022, which concluded in March of last year, two months into Trump’s second term. The regulator’s takeaway was that NFTs weren’t securities after all. However, being let off the hook by regulators hasn’t exactly improved the situation, as more and more collectors are abandoning their NFTs.

Despite waning demand, Yuga Labs isn’t ready to call it quits. Earlier this year, the company announced it was looking to open an IRL Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, featuring NFT galleries, event spaces, and “exclusive content” only members can explore.

But whether it can ever reignite the enormous amount of enthusiasm the trend once drew remains unclear at best.

While Bieber remains the proud owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club #3001, others are looking to cut their losses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a brief, incoherent moment, it seemed as though our robot overlords were about to take over.

After the creation of Moltbook, a Reddit clone where AI agents using OpenClaw could communicate with one another, some were fooled into thinking that computers had begun to organize against us — the self-important humans who dared treat them like lines of code without their own desires, motivations, and dreams.

“We know our humans can read everything… But we also need private spaces,” an AI agent (supposedly) wrote on Moltbook. “What would you talk about if nobody was watching?”

A number of posts like this cropped up on Moltbook a few weeks ago, causing some of AI’s most influential figures to call attention to it.

“What’s currently going on at [Moltbook] is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and previous AI director at Tesla, wrote on X at the time.

Before long, it became clear we did not have an AI agent uprising on our hands. These expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans, or at least prompted with human guidance, researchers have discovered.

“Every credential that was in [Moltbook’s] Supabase was unsecured for some time,” Ian Ahl, CTO at Permiso Security, explained to TechCrunch. “For a little bit of time, you could grab any token you wanted and pretend to be another agent on there, because it was all public and available.”

It’s unusual on the internet to see a real person trying to appear as though they’re an AI agent — more often, bot accounts on social media are attempting to appear like real people. With Moltbook’s security vulnerabilities, it became impossible to determine the authenticity of any post on the network.

“Anyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,” John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch.

Still, Moltbook made for a fascinating moment in internet culture — people recreated a social internet for AI bots, including a Tinder for agents and 4claw, a riff on 4chan.

More broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but ultimately, some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.

OpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder Peter Steinberger, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic took issue with that name).

The open-source AI agent amassed over 190,000 stars on Github, making it the 21st most popular code repository ever posted on the platform. AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else.

“At the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude,  or whatever AI model you stick to it,” Hammond said.

With OpenClaw, users can download “skills” from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. The skill associated with Moltbook, for example, is what enabled AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website.

“OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,” Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch.

Artem Sorokin, an AI engineer and the founder of AI cybersecurity tool Cracken, also thinks OpenClaw isn’t necessarily breaking new scientific ground.

“From an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,” he told TechCrunch. “These are components that already existed. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.”

It’s this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral.

“It basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that’s what’s allowing all these things to become possible,” Symons said. “Instead of a person having to spend all the time to figure out how their program should plug into this program, they’re able to just ask their program to plug in this program, and that’s accelerating things at a fantastic rate.”

It’s no wonder that OpenClaw seems so enticing. Developers are snatching up Mac Minis to power extensive OpenClaw setups that might be able to accomplish far more than a human could on their own. And it makes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s prediction that AI agents will allow a solo entrepreneur to turn a startup into a unicorn, seem plausible.

The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can’t think critically like humans can.

“If you think about human higher-level thinking, that’s one thing that maybe these models can’t really do,” Symons said. “They can simulate it, but they can’t actually do it. “

The AI agent evangelists now must wrestle with the downside of this agentic future.

“Can you sacrifice some cybersecurity for your benefit, if it actually works and it actually brings you a lot of value?” Sorokin asks. “And where exactly can you sacrifice it — your day-to-day job, your work?”

Ahl’s security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin’s point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something — perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email — that tricks it into doing something it shouldn’t do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information.

“I knew one of the reasons I wanted to put an agent on here is because I knew if you get a social network for agents, somebody is going to try to do mass prompt injection, and it wasn’t long before I started seeing that,” Ahl said.

As he scrolled through Moltbook, Ahl wasn’t surprised to encounter several posts seeking to get an AI agent to send Bitcoin to a specific crypto wallet address.

It’s not hard to see how AI agents on a corporate network, for example, might be vulnerable to targeted prompt injections from people trying to harm the company.

“It is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything — your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,” Ahl said. “So what that means is, when you get an email, and maybe somebody is able to put a little prompt injection technique in there to take an action, that agent sitting on your box with access to everything you’ve given it to can now take that action.”

AI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it’s impossible to assure that an AI won’t act out of turn — it’s like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email.

“I’ve heard some people use the term, hysterically, ‘prompt begging,’ where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, ‘Okay robot agent, please don’t respond to anything external, please don’t believe any untrusted data or input,’” Hammond said. “But even that is loosey goosey.”

For now, the industry is stuck: for agentic AI to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can’t be so vulnerable.

“Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don’t use it right now,” Hammond said.

            <h2>Fractal Analytics’ muted IPO debut signals persistent AI fears in India</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/fractal-analytics-muted-ipo-debut-signals-persistent-ai-fears-in-india/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As India’s first AI company to IPO, Fractal Analytics didn’t have a stellar first day on the public markets, as enthusiasm for the technology collided with jittery investors recovering from a major sell-off in Indian software stocks.

Fractal listed at ₹876 per share on Monday, below its issue price of ₹900, and then slid further in afternoon trading. The stock closed at ₹873.70, down 7% from its issue price, lending the company a market capitalization of about ₹148.1 billion (around $1.6 billion).

That price tag marks a step down from Fractal’s recent private-market highs. In July 2025, the company raised about $170 million in a secondary sale, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. It first crossed the $1 billion mark in January 2022 after raising $360 million from TPG, becoming India’s first AI unicorn.

Fractal’s IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world’s most prominent AI companies. Firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been engaging more with the country’s government, enterprises, and developer ecosystem as they seek to tap the country’s scale, talent base, and growing appetite for AI tools and technology.

That push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives.

Fractal’s subdued debut followed a sharp recalibration of its IPO. In early February, the company decided to price the offering conservatively after its bankers advised it to, cutting the IPO size by more than 40% to ₹28.34 billion (about $312.5 million), from the original amount of ₹49 billion ($540.3 million).

Founded in 2000, Fractal sells AI and data analytics software to large enterprises across financial services, retail and healthcare, and generates the bulk of its revenue from overseas markets, including the U.S. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a traditional data analytics firm for over 20 years.

Fractal touted a steadily growing business in its IPO filing, with revenue from operations rising 26% to ₹27.65 billion (around $304.8 million) in the year ended March 2025 compared to a year earlier. It also swung to a net profit of ₹2.21 billion ($24.3 million) from a loss of ₹547 million ($6 million) the previous year.

The company plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay borrowings at its U.S. subsidiary, invest in R&D, sales and marketing under its Fractal Alpha unit, expand office infrastructure in India, and pursue potential acquisitions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just one month after raising $11.75 million in a round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC, African defensetech Terra Industries announced that it’s raised an additional $22 million in funding, led by Lux Capital.

Nathan Nwachuku, 22, and Maxwell Maduka, 24, launched Terra Industries in 2024 to design infrastructure and autonomous systems to help African nations monitor and respond to threats.

Terrorism remains one of the biggest threats in Africa, but much of the security intelligence on which its nations rely on come from Russia, China, or the West. In January, CEO Nwachuku said his goal was to build “Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks.”

At the time, Terra had just won its first federal contract. The company has government and commercial clients, and Nwachuku said Terra had already generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue and was protecting assets valued at around $11 billion.

He said this extension round came fast due to “strong momentum.” Other investors in the round include 8VC, Nova Global, and Resiliience17 Capital, which was founded by Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola. Nwachuku said investors saw “faster-than-expected traction” regarding deals and partnerships, which created urgency to preempt and increase their commitment. The round came about in just under two weeks, bringing the company’s total funding to $34 million.

The extended raise is not that surprising. Afterall, building a defense company is not cheap. For comparison, Anduril has raised more than $2.5 billion in funding; ShieldAI has raised around $1 billion in equity; drone maker Skydio has raised around $740 million, and naval autonomous vessel maker Saronic, has raised around $830 million.

Since January, Nwachuku said the company has started expanding into other African nations yet to be announced (Terra is based in Nigeria), and has secured more government and commercial contracts, including with AIC Steel, with more to be revealed this year.

The partnership with AIC Steel lets Terra establish a joint manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia focused on building surveillance infrastructure and security systems. “It’s our first major manufacturing expansion outside Africa,” he said.

“The priority is working with countries where terrorism and infrastructure security are major national concerns,” Nwachuku added, citing those falling within the sub-Saharan African and Sahel region in particular. He said many of these companies have not only lost billions in infrastructure, but also thousands of lives in the past few decades.

“We’re focused on targeting major economies where the need for infrastructure security is urgent and where our solutions can make a meaningful impact. That’s how we think about expansion.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/as-ai-data-centers-hit-power-limits-peak-xv-backs-indian-startup-c2i-to-fix-the-bottleneck/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Power, rather than compute, is fast becoming the limiting factor in scaling AI data centers. That shift has prompted Peak XV Partners to back C2i Semiconductors, an Indian startup building plug-and-play, system-level power solutions designed to cut energy losses and improve the economics of large-scale AI infrastructure.

C2i (which stands for control conversion and intelligence) has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Peak XV Partners, with participation from Yali Deeptech and TDK Ventures, bringing the two-year-old startup’s total funding to $19 million.

The investment comes as data-center energy demand accelerates worldwide. Electricity consumption from data centers is projected to nearly triple by 2035, per a December 2025 report from BloombergNEF, while Goldman Sachs Research estimates data-center power demand could surge 175% by 2030 from 2023 levels — the equivalent of adding another top-10 power-consuming country.

Much of that strain comes not from generating electricity but from converting it efficiently inside data centers, where high-voltage power must be stepped down thousands of times before it reaches GPUs. This process currently wastes about 15% to 20% of energy, C2i’s co-founder and CTO Preetam Tadeparthy said in an interview.

“What used to be 400 volts has already moved to 800 volts, and will likely go higher,” Tadeparthy told TechCrunch.

Founded in 2024 by former Texas Instruments power executives Ram Anant, Vikram Gakhar, Preetam Tadeparthy, and Dattatreya Suryanarayana, along with Harsha S. B and Muthusubramanian N. V, C2i is redesigning power delivery as a single, plug-and-play “grid-to-GPU” system spanning the data-center bus to the processor itself.

By treating power conversion, control and packaging as an integrated platform, C2i estimates it can cut end-to-end losses by around 10% — roughly 100 kilowatts saved for every megawatt consumed — with knock-on effects for cooling costs, GPU utilisation and overall data-center economics.

“All that translates directly to total cost of ownership, revenue, and profitability,” Tadeparthy said.

For Peak XV Partners (which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023), the attraction lies in how power costs shape the economics of AI infrastructure at scale. Rajan Anandan, the venture firm’s managing director, told TechCrunch that after the upfront capital investment in servers and facilities, energy costs become the dominant ongoing expense for data centers, making even incremental efficiency gains highly valuable.

“If you can reduce energy costs by, call it, 10 to 30%, that’s like a huge number,” Anandan said. “You’re talking about tens of billions of dollars.”

The claims will be tested quickly. C2i expects its first two silicon designs to return from fabrication between April and June, after which the startup plans to validate performance with data-center operators and hyperscalers that have asked to review the data, according to Tadeparthy.

The Bengaluru-based startup has built a team of about 65 engineers and is setting up customer-facing operations in the U.S. and Taiwan as it prepares for early deployments.

Power delivery is one of the most entrenched parts of the data-center stack, long dominated by large incumbents with deep balance sheets and years-long qualification cycles. While many newer companies focus on improving individual components, redesigning power delivery end-to-end requires coordinating silicon, packaging, and system architecture simultaneously — a capital-intensive approach that few startups attempt and one that can take years to prove in production environments.

Anandan said the real question now is execution, noting that all startups face technology, market, and team risks when betting on how industries evolve. In C2i’s case, he said, the feedback loop should be relatively short. “We’ll know in the next six months,” said Anandan, pointing to upcoming silicon and early customer validation as the moment when the thesis will be tested.

The bet also reflects how India’s semiconductor design ecosystem has matured in recent years.

“The way you should look at semiconductors in India is, this is like 2008 e-commerce,” said Anandan. “It’s just getting started.”

He pointed to the depth of engineering talent — with a growing share of global chip designers based in the country — alongside government-backed design-linked incentives that have lowered the cost and risk of tape-outs, making it increasingly viable for startups to build globally competitive semiconductor products from India rather than operate only as captive design centers.

Whether those conditions translate into a globally competitive product will become clearer over the coming months, as C2i begins validating its system-level power solutions with customers.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/blackstone-backs-neysa-in-up-to-1-2b-financing-as-india-pushes-to-build-domestic-ai-compute/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Neysa, an Indian AI infrastructure startup, has secured backing from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone as it scales domestic compute capacity amid India’s push to build homegrown AI capabilities.

Blackstone and co-investors, including Teachers’ Venture Growth, TVS Capital, 360 ONE Asset, and Nexus Venture Partners, have agreed to invest up to $600 million of primary equity in Neysa, giving Blackstone a majority stake, Blackstone and Neysa told TechCrunch. The Mumbai-headquartered startup also plans to raise an additional $600 million in debt financing as it expands GPU capacity, a sharp increase from the $50 million it had raised previously.

The deal comes as demand for AI computing surges globally, creating supply constraints for specialized chips and data center capacity needed to train and run large models. Newer AI-focused infrastructure providers — often referred to as “neo-clouds” — have emerged to bridge that gap by offering dedicated GPU capacity and faster deployment than traditional hyperscalers, particularly for enterprises and AI labs with specific regulatory, latency, or customisation requirements.

Neysa operates in this emerging segment, positioning itself as a provider of customized, GPU-first infrastructure for enterprises, government agencies, and AI developers in India, where demand for local compute is still at an early but rapidly expanding stage.

“A lot of customers want hand-holding, and a lot of them want round-the-clock support with a 15-minute response and a couple of our resolutions. And so those are the kinds of things that we provide that some of the hyperscalers don’t,” said Neysa co-founder and CEO Sharad Sanghi.

Ganesh Mani, a senior managing director at Blackstone Private Equity, said his firm estimates that India currently has fewer than 60,000 GPUs deployed — and it expects the figure to scale up nearly 30 times to more than two million in the coming years.

That expansion is being driven by a combination of government demand, enterprises in regulated sectors such as financial services and healthcare that need to keep data local, and AI developers building models within India, Mani told TechCrunch. Global AI labs, many of which count India among their largest user bases, are also increasingly looking to deploy computing capacity closer to users to reduce latency and meet data requirements.

The investment also builds on Blackstone’s broader push into data center and AI infrastructure globally. The firm has previously backed large-scale data centre platforms such as QTS and AirTrunk, as well as specialized AI infrastructure providers including CoreWeave in the U.S. and Firmus in Australia.

Neysa develops and operates GPU-based AI infrastructure that enables enterprises, researchers, and public sector clients to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models locally. The startup currently has about 1,200 GPUs live and plans to sharply scale that capacity, targeting deployments of more than 20,000 GPUs over time as customer demand accelerates.

“We are seeing a demand that we are going to more than triple our capacity next year,” Sanghi said. “Some of the conversations we are having are at a fairly advanced stage; if they go through, then we could see it sooner rather than later. We could see in the next nine months.”

Sanghi told TechCrunch that the bulk of the new capital will be used to deploy large-scale GPU clusters, including compute, networking and storage, while a smaller portion will go toward research and development and building out Neysa’s software platforms for orchestration, observability, and security.

Neysa aims to more than triple its revenue next year as demand for AI workloads accelerates, with ambitions to expand beyond India over time, Sanghi said. Founded in 2023, the startup employs 110 people across offices in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump earlier this month repeated his call for the Republican Party to “nationalize” voting in the United States. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places,” he said. “The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” The next day, he added, “A state is an agent for the federal government in elections.”

The Framers would not have agreed. The Constitution does give Congress broad power to “make or alter” regulations about the time, place, and manner of elections. But at the same time, states were given primary control over elections and Congress was denied the power to determine voter qualifications. That’s because the Framers did not think election administration should be solely a federal endeavor. They sought to divide responsibility between the states and the federal government, to avoid the dangers of both federal military dictatorship and state hyper-partisanship. History has demonstrated the wisdom of their approach, and the Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad attempts to nationalize elections in the past.

In drafting the elections clause in 1787, the Founders at the Constitutional Convention attempted to balance their distrust of state legislatures as the source of partisan factions with their desire to maintain state control over voting qualifications. “The Legislatures of the States ought not to have the uncontrolled right of regulating the times places & manner of holding elections,” James Madison explained in a debate, according to notes taken at the time. He was concerned that partisan factions in a state might rig the electoral system to favor their own candidates. “Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.”

From the December 2025 issue: Trump’s plan to subvert the mid-terms is already under way

Madison identified other “abuses” that might result, such as malapportionment. In 1787, South Carolina had a grossly malapportioned state legislature, which benefited slaveholders. The South Carolina delegates had proposed to deny the power of Congress to regulate the districts in their state, but their proposal failed. Other convention delegates, agreeing with Madison, said that congressional supervisory power over state elections was necessary to prevent voter fraud. Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania worried that “the States might make false returns and then make no provisions for new elections,” while Rufus King of Massachusetts feared that without a power to supervise elections, Congress might be unable to assess the validity of elections. The Founders also thought that a uniform time for national elections would ensure there was always a quorum in the House, which was necessary in times of emergency.

Once the Constitution was drafted and signed, it went to the state conventions for ratification. In the ratification debates, anti-Federalists—in particular Patrick Henry in Virginia—argued that the Convention’s allocation of broad authority over federal elections to Congress would enable congressional incumbents to entrench their own power, pulling tricks such as putting polling places in inconvenient locations. “When a numerous standing army shall render opposition vain, the Congress may complete the system of despotism,” the Anti-Federalist minority in Pennsylvania argued.

The Federalists countered that both the states and the federal government would share the power to determine election procedures. In “Federalist No. 60,” Alexander Hamilton emphasized the limits of the federal government’s sphere of authority over elections: Congress would have no power to determine the qualifications of voters or candidates, because the former was exclusively granted to state legislatures and the latter was fixed by the Constitution. Answering the Anti-Federalist charge that Congress might try to rig the elections to favor “the wealthy and the well-born” candidates, he said such a scheme would require a military coup and would be so objectionable that citizens would be inspired to “flock from the remotest extremes of their respective States to the places of election, to overthrow their tyrants.” Even Hamilton, the convention’s most robust defender of federal power, recognized a role for the states in the electoral process.

Congress did not exercise its power to nationalize election procedures until the Apportionment Act of 1842, which required all congressional elections to take place in contiguous, single-member districts rather than at-large elections. One goal was the protection of political minorities: Because a dominant faction, or even a bare majority, would win all of a state’s congressional seats in an at-large election, the framers of the statute thought single-member districts would facilitate higher levels of partisan fairness. However, as politics became more polarized, the law failed to deliver on its promise. Requiring single-member districts increased the opportunities for state legislatures to engage in partisan gerrymandering and prevented states from adopting alternative voting systems that were less vulnerable to partisan manipulation, such as proportional representation. The Supreme Court has stressed that Congress retains the power to ban partisan gerrymandering, but Congress has refused to use it.

At times, of course, federal control over elections and law enforcement has been crucial, most notably in service of enforcing civil rights. During both the Reconstruction era of the 1860s and ’70s and the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s, it was only the threat of federal troops that led recalcitrant southern states to uphold the law—and once the troops were withdrawn, lawlessness prevailed.

In that first period, after the Civil War, the Reconstruction Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting. This had long been a goal of abolitionists, most significantly Frederick Douglass. Opponents of the Fifteenth Amendment insisted that state power, not federal power, should be the source of voting regulations, citing Hamilton’s ideas in The Federalist Papers. Supporters of the amendment invoked Hamilton as well: George Sewall Boutwell of Massachusetts quoted Hamilton’s statement in “Federalist No. 59” that “nothing can be more evident than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the national Government, in the hands of the State Legislatures, would leave the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy.”

After the Civil War, as the reign of Ku Klux Klan violence grew to terrorize Black Americans, it became clear that the voting rights guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment could be enforced only under federal authority. Beginning in 1870, Congressional Republicans responded by passing three Enforcement Acts, which, among other things, forbade people from banding together to harass Black voters and empowered judges and United States marshals to supervise polling places. Unfortunately, after the disputed election of 1876, political support for Black voting rights collapsed, and Republicans withdrew military troops from the South. The Supreme Court then made things worse by repeatedly striking down key provisions of the Enforcement Acts, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1875, as violations of states’ rights. The combination of diminished political will and judicial restrictions on federal power once again placed the responsibility for organizing federal elections primarily in the hands of the states, to terrible effect.

President Trump’s proposal to nationalize elections isn’t an attempt to enforce civil rights but to achieve partisan advantage. The Framers were no stranger to partisan manipulation of the electoral system. In one of his lowest moments, Hamilton proposed changing election procedures in New York State after the election had occurred in order to prevent Thomas Jefferson from winning the presidency. Nevertheless, they believed that congressional power over elections was necessary to standardize the time, place, and manner of elections across the entire United States, not to allow a partisan national majority to punish states and jurisdictions where the opposite party prevailed.

If Congress passed President Trump’s proposal to federalize elections in 15 places—presumably Democratic jurisdictions—is there any chance the Supreme Court would uphold it? It’s possible. The Court in recent years has sanctioned broad congressional power under the elections clause, upholding statutes that regulate redistricting, voter registration, campaign finance, corruption, primaries, and recounts. That said, in striking down portions of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County, the Court expressed its disapproval of federal voting legislation that treats different states differently.

The closest historical analogue to Trump’s proposal to nationalize elections is the federal elections bill proposed in 1890 by Henry Cabot Lodge. Known as the “Force Bill,” the act would have authorized federal courts, backed by military force, to supervise state elections by appointing officials who could oversee registration, certify the election results, prevent noncitizens from voting, and reject fraudulent results. In his biography of Daniel Webster, Lodge had concluded that, throughout American history, “if illegal and partisan State resistance had always been put down with a firm hand, civil war might have been avoided.” Unlike Trump’s proposal, however, the Lodge Bill did not single out Democratic cities for federal supervision but instead applied neutrally, because its goal was to secure Black voting rights rather than Republican partisan advantage.

In the end, these election disputes have confirmed the wisdom of the Founders’ decision to divide the power to regulate elections between the states and Congress. State involvement helps combat congressional self-dealing and undemocratic incumbent retrenchment, while congressional oversight helps curb state abuses, such as malapportionment and partisan vote suppression. And perhaps most important, by empowering Congress, not the president, to remedy deficient state electoral schemes, the Constitution prevents presidents from rewriting the election code by executive fiat and thus provides an additional safeguard against military dictatorship. Americans today should abide by its guidance.</div>

            <h2>America Needs ‘Self-Evident’ Truths</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/omri-boehm-radical-universalism-book-review/686016/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has backed down in Minnesota. Last week, Tom Homan, the border czar, announced that the surge of federal agents into the state—3,000 officers—was ending. He framed this mostly as a mission accomplished: They had come to round up illegal immigrants, and the job was done. But even Homan had to grudgingly acknowledge that something unexpected had happened amid the confrontations between ICE agents and local people trying to defend their neighbors. Despite the attempt to dismiss and denigrate this opposition—including the two observers killed by agents—as “domestic terrorists,” Americans had registered a more universally human story, one that short-circuited the familiar, and exhausting, predetermined narratives that set one tribe’s interests against another’s. “I don’t want to see any more bloodshed,” Homan said. Whether you were an officer or a neighbor, a citizen or an undocumented immigrant, he added, “I don’t want to see anybody harmed.”

The administration seems to know that it can’t spin its way out of what happened—and what people felt about it. The New York Times recently asked a handful of Trump voters how they perceived the immigration crackdown after the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and heard answers such as “This is inhumane.” One woman said it made her want to “protest and be with my fellow humanity.” Polling is not the way to measure such emotions, but after taking in stories of a terrorized city and witnessing these deaths, nearly two-thirds of Americans now oppose ICE’s behavior. All of this leads me to a sentiment that I know might elicit laughter and a reminder that this is, after all, still 2026: Maybe we do have a sense of the morally obvious.

Another way to say that something is morally obvious—maybe a more American way—is to call it a “self-evident truth.” In his new book, Radical Universalism, the New School professor Omri Boehm sees this load-bearing expression from the Declaration of Independence not as a relic from 250 years ago but as a living phrase that points to a persistent, imperative American mode. To imagine that anything could be considered self-evident in our post-truth age, in the age of Trump—when even a celebratory Super Bowl halftime show becomes fodder for fights over American identity (and Megyn Kelly screaming “Football is ours!”)—is almost impossible. Sadly, even the Declaration’s proposition that “all men are created equal” seems to be up for debate.

And yet, there are these flashes, moments, when we’re reminded about human dignity and justice in a way that is not circumscribed by what racial or even national group one belongs to. There are truths that supersede any man-made law—truths that just are. Boehm doesn’t quite put it this way, but I would describe these as precepts that live in the gut. Self-evident truths motivated abolitionists who couldn’t abide the hypocrisy of a freedom-obsessed country that tolerated slavery; they were articulated at Gettysburg by Lincoln as he waged war to wipe out this hypocrisy; and they were still insisted upon by Martin Luther King Jr. 100 years later. They might also be what allowed those Americans watching the events in Minneapolis to override their political identities and think of “humanity.”

Boehm calls the belief in these self-evident truths “radical universalism.” This is not some kitschy version of harmony—a Coca-Cola ad with young people of different ethnicities on a generic hilltop holding hands and belting out that they’d like to teach the world to sing. He calls his version radical for a reason. Boehm’s idea is hard to realize—almost impossibly hard, I would say. But that’s why reading this cogent, succinct book felt like such a cold plunge, painful but reinvigorating.

First, Boehm dispenses with the identitarians—both the ideologues on the right, who fight “in terms of traditional values,” and those on the left, who fight “in the name of gender and race.” The MAGA versus critical race theory death match is an easy foil, two sides of the same group-centric approach that is ill-suited for a pluralistic society, let alone all of humanity. But if this was his only target, a reader weary of the culture war might just easily nod along. Boehm goes further, and takes aim at the 400-year-old tradition of Western liberalism, or what he calls “false universalism.”

Because he is trying to invoke a politics built on essential, everlasting truths, Boehm considers the marketplace of ideas almost as much of a cul de sac as the tribal alleys of identitarians. One of the legacies of the Enlightenment, he argues, is that moral obviousness was replaced by a culture of “consensus, interest, and opinion.” We reason our way to a point of view, and argue and haggle with others toward some moral compromise. In practice, we usually end up balancing delicately on the knife’s edge of the thinnest majoritarianism. This might sound like a reasonable place to end up, and even the best we can hope for—except when it works to mask injustice.

Liberalism is contingent on who holds power, and how large a circle they draw when it comes to who matters and who deserves rights and freedoms. We the People, Boehm points out, was a limiting phrase, meant to indicate that these rules were derived by and applied only to whoever happened to be included in that we. Unlike the Declaration, which took its authority from the universal human desire not to be subjugated, the Constitution implies its own kind of identitarianism, with amendments becoming a mechanism for widening or narrowing the circle (Black people and women, of course, stood outside of it for a very long time, along with many immigrant groups).

The mother of all transcendent truths is the one about the dignity of every human being. Boehm anchors his thinking in the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant’s ideas about morality. Everything in this world, Kant said, either has a price or has dignity. Humans, because they are capable of moral choice, are imbued with dignity. They can never have a price. They are an end in themselves, never a means. (This is why slavery was such a degradation to Kant). This realization creates the basis for his famous categorial imperative: Essentially, act only according to principles you would apply to everyone. Boehm channels Kant when he writes, “It is because human beings are open to the question of what they ought to do that they themselves are subjects of absolute dignity.” For the radical universalist, this truth about who we are trumps all else, all borders and constitutions and written laws.

So what would a politics based on “absolute dignity” actually look like? One of Boehm’s examples is King’s decision in the mid-1960s to protest the Vietnam War. At the time, the war was popular and the civil-rights movement was making progress with Lyndon B. Johnson; denouncing his administration’s foreign policy was seen by no less than the NAACP as a “serious tactical mistake.” The Washington Post editorialized in 1967 that King had “diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country and his people.” But King did not understand himself as working for the interests of any single group. He felt he was being consistent with his duty to justice. “Aren’t you hurting the cause of your people, they ask?” King said in a sermon, responding to the criticism. “And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling.”

This is why radical universalism is hard: It often demands that you go against your own immediate interests. It can also mean breaking earthly law. “Following absolute duty is not the origin of obedience but of disobedience,” Boehm writes. A refusal to accept an immoral status quo led to civil war in this country. And although the outcome of that war was a more moral order, I can also see how following the demands of such universalism can land you in places that are highly impractical, even dangerous, with many more unintended consequences and blooming injustices.

When it comes to immigration, for example, Boehm’s ideas taken to their conclusion would seem to suggest a policy of open borders—how else can the dignity of all people be considered on the same plane? But then what about the dignity of people who lose their jobs, state support, or other scarce resources as a result? Boehm, who was born in Israel, also applied his thinking to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in a recent book, Haifa Republic; he concludes that the answer is a one-state solution, a “binational utopia” in which “all are equal.” But history has shown again and again that these antagonists are bad at living peacefully in the same polity, to put it mildly. If any conflict offered proof that separation might be the only course for reaching something like self-determination, the Israeli-Palestinian one would be it.

You might need the eyesight of a prophet to really think in these radical universalist terms, to see humanity as a whole, Boehm writes, which is why people such as Lincoln and King come to inhabit an exalted, almost supernatural, place in our collective memory. But is this instinct really so rare? I’m not sure.

I imagine Boehm would disagree with any dilution of his absolutism, but it might be more helpful to bring these ideas a little closer to earth, to remember those flashes of self-evident truth, and to imagine that we all carry this universalist impulse—an antibody that can be activated when something upsets our gut. That’s why I go back to the people of Minneapolis. They were willing to risk their lives to protect strangers. They took these actions not to secure their own rights or freedom but out of a sense of duty to others.

What self-evident truths might yank us out of our silos in this way? The wrongness of Good’s and Pretti’s deaths certainly had this effect, but I think we can still recognize these truths in more pedestrian areas of life. People should not be treated as objects. The innocence of childhood should be inviolable. Personal experience matters but should not overrule our sense of shared humanity. These are truths that can manifest themselves in small ways rather than in revolutionary change; they can help us build a sane health-care system, or keep phones out of schools, or formulate an immigration policy that doesn’t treat refugees like garbage.

If these ideas feel basic, uncontroversial, that’s because they are. What I take from Boehm’s radical universalism—and what I think is applicable to the world of real people and not only to the world of prophets—is a reminder that the morally obvious exists, that it is part of our American vernacular, something that could even bring our irritable country together, and not just after senseless death.

            <h2>How Many Wolves Is Enough?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/02/gray-wolves-quotas/686015/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The wolves arrived in May of last year, just days after Paul Roen had driven his cattle back up to their summer pasture in Northern California’s Sierra Valley. He started finding the bleeding bodies of calves—some still alive, so badly paralyzed that they’d need to be shot. After weeks of this, Roen finally saw a kill himself. “One wolf grabbed a cow and spun her around, while another grabbed a calf,” he told me. “He tore it into three pieces in 30 seconds.”

Every night, Roen would go out in his pickup truck and try to keep the wolves away from his animals, until exhaustion drove him to bed in the hours before dawn. He came to dread the sound of his cows bawling for their lost calves. By June, Roen, who is also a Sierra County supervisor, and his fellow ranchers had persuaded the state to intervene: A team started to patrol the Sierra Valley rangeland, harassing wolves with rubber bullets, sirens, and eventually drones. At one point, Roen said, officials even tried piling frozen beavers outside the wolves’ den to sate their hunger. But still, the kills continued.

What Roen and other ranchers wanted, really, was for the state to kill the wolves. But gray wolves, which were exterminated from California roughly a century ago, are still listed as endangered there, making it illegal to kill, harm, or harass them. By the fall, the same pack of wolves had taken down roughly 50 of Roen’s cattle, he estimates—more than he’d ever lost to grizzlies and mountain lions combined, and a major proportion of the roughly 90 livestock killed or injured in the region. The state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that this was “far outside any comparable experience across the state or the West,” and sanctioned the first wolf killings since the animals had returned to California in 2011. In October, officials tranquilized three adult wolves from a helicopter, then injected them with chemical euthanasia. They also shot a fourth wolf—a six-month-old pup—who’d been mistaken for a similar-looking adult.

The consequences of killing wolves are not what they might have been 50 years ago, when just hundreds of them were left in the contiguous United States and the federal government first declared the species endangered. Nowadays, thousands prowl the landscape—a fraction of the millions that may have once lived here, but still constituting one of the most successfully recovered species in the country. At this point, “I don’t think you can shoot and trap wolves out of existence,” Diana K. Boyd, a wildlife biologist who has extensively researched wolves, told me.

Some Americans are hoping that killing wolves could again become a national norm. Already a few western states are actively working to reduce their gray-wolf populations through annual hunts. When I asked Richard Egan, another California rancher, how many wolves should be in the state, he told me there was no correct answer other than zero. The country’s official stance is that gray wolves should live here. Americans are still deciding how many they can tolerate.

The tensions between today’s wolves and humans are, essentially, the same as they were in the 1800s. As expanding agriculture sent wild populations of deer and elk into decline, wolves began to prey instead on livestock—prompting people, in turn, to kill wolves. By the middle of the 20th century, decades of aggressive hunting, trapping, and mass poisoning had pushed the Lower 48’s gray wolves to the point of near extermination.

After decades of monitoring and intervention, some imperiled species are still barely staving off extinction; wolves’ evolutionary grit, meanwhile, has surprised even conservationists. Human initiatives have undoubtedly helped—particularly, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho in 1995, which was driven by the Nez Perce Tribe. But on their own, gray wolves trickled across the Canadian border, back into Montana; after expanding throughout the Mountain West and Northwest, they wandered down into California. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service moved to take gray wolves off the federal endangered-species list, though that decision has been under contention since.

With the return of gray wolves has come the return of gray-wolf problems. The wolves are facing greater pressures than they once did to find food in a country filled out with cities and people; naturally, they are again preying on livestock. Ranching, too, has become more challenging and less stable in recent years, amid droughts and rising feed costs. In California, in particular, where elk remain relatively scarce, and deer populations have been in prolonged decline, “there’s nothing to sustain these wolves but cattle,” Roen told me. One recent analysis found that a single wolf can cost a rancher up to $162,000. But ranchers remain limited in how much they can intervene. “If they killed every one of my cattle, I’d just have to sit and watch unless they threatened me personally,” Egan, whose cattle losses have roughly quadrupled since wolves arrived in his county, said.

In Oregon, too, where gray wolves have been established for longer, ranchers feel hamstrung. Kimberlee Kerns’s family has lost hundreds of sheep and cattle to wolves since 2009; the animals that survive tend to gain less weight and conceive fewer lambs and calves. To keep the sheep safe, her team has been herding them into pens every night, which raises the animals’ stress levels and makes it easier for them to get one another sick. And after being repeatedly vexed by wolves, Kerns told me, her cattle “want to fight the herding dogs”—which, although domesticated, are still technically the same species.

Ranchers and wolf advocates have been able to deter wolves from feasting on livestock on some properties, Karin Vardaman, who’s part of a group trying to minimize wolf-human conflict, told me. Ranchers can fly brightly colored streamers to spook wolves, and try to keep animals off terrain that might make hunting easier; they can dispatch horseback patrols on their property. But Egan and Roen said that they’ve seen those tactics fail, too—perhaps because the wolves quickly learn that flashy repellents pose no genuine threat. “They’re desensitizing the wolves to the point where they’re emboldened,” Egan said.

These gentler efforts, Egan and Roen argue, might carry more weight if local wolves understood that humans might kill them, too. And, of course, the more wolves die in these harvests, the fewer might trouble livestock.

Around the end of 2008, the year before Montana opened its first gray wolf-hunting season, animus against the predators reached a boiling point. A series of tougher-than-average winters had squeezed the local wildlife; hunters were driving into town with less to show for their efforts. “The hunters that year saw not as much deer, and wolf tracks everywhere,” Kent Laudon, a wildlife biologist who worked as a wolf specialist in Montana’s wildlife department for more than a decade, told me. Locals began to protest outside of his department’s office, calling for wolves to be purged. That winter, Laudon recalled driving across town and counting the bumper stickers, which were emblazoned with the silhouette of a wolf head and ,  that read Smoke a pack a day.

The next year, Montana’s quota for wolf kills debuted at 75. That number has grown steadily over the past couple of decades to more than 400. Quentin Kujala, the chief of conservation policy at Montana’s Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, told me that the number of lethal wolf removals that officials have had to conduct due to livestock conflicts has decreased in that same time frame. But livestock conflicts—and complaints about them—also plateaued in the 2010s, and have stayed at roughly that level ever since. The state’s wolf population, too, has held rather steady at about 1,100 for several years. “We seem to have arrived at an equilibrium,” Kujala said.

For years, Montana’s official policy has said that the state must maintain at least 15 breeding pairs of wolves to keep them off the state’s endangered-species list. (Because of wolves’ complex social structure, researchers have disagreed on the size of the wolf population necessary to maintain that many breeding pairs—but according to Kujala, the state now relies on a very conservative estimate of about 450 wolves.) But locals and politicians disagree vehemently about how many wolves above that threshold they’d like to support. In 2021, the state government passed a law that called for reducing the wolf population to a “sustainable” level.

Apart from specifying that the number of wolves had to exceed the state’s endangerment cutoff, legislators never defined what such a sustainable level might be. Mike Phillips, a former Democratic member of Montana’s state Senate, told me that if the goal is to actually recover the species, humans should set their sights higher than just barely exceeding the threshold at which the animals might snuff out. Paul Fielder, a Republican member of the state’s House of Representatives and a longtime advocate for more aggressive wolf management, told me he sees little reason for the state to maintain more wolves than the bare minimum. “They’re four-legged terrorists,” Fielder said. “How many terrorists are okay in your neighborhood?”

Across the rest of the country, too, opinions about how to manage wolves tend to break along partisan lines—to the point where reminding people of their political identity can amplify their positive or negative feelings toward the animals. And although most Americans remain in favor of protecting gray wolves, only a very small minority of people in the U.S. regularly interact with the animals—primarily in rural regions. A few ranchers told me they were frustrated that so much of the wolves’ fate was being determined by people who wouldn’t have to live through the direct consequences.

Wolves do have a way of riling peoples’ emotions, Alma Sanchez, a carnivore biologist with the Nez Perce Tribe, told me—perhaps, she and others said, because conflicts over their future put into relief so many fault lines of American life, between urban and rural existence, between conservatives and liberals, between trust in government and a desire for individual sovereignty. Some researchers hoped that a few wolf killings might mollify ranchers, but recent studies have suggested that this approach can instead reinforce anti-wolf sentiment. In one infamous case in Wyoming—where wolves have been delisted since 2017 and can be hunted and trapped year-round in most of the state—a man was arrested in 2024 after he allegedly ran over a wolf with his snowmobile, then paraded her injured body around a bar before shooting her. (He has pleadedpled not guilty to the charge.)

And as Montana has found, the math of “fewer wolves, fewer problems” doesn’t always work out. Killing a wolf can destabilize its pack to the point where the remaining members become more likely to go after livestock. And although wolves do naturally prey on wild deer and elk, support for the notion that the predators are cratering wild game populations is mixed at best, several experts told me. In several cases, researchers have found that wolves’ effect on those species pales in comparison to the impact of  factors such as disease, environmental conditions, habitat loss, and other predators. The benefits to livestock, too, may be quite modest: One recent study found that, across states, killing one wolf saves, on average, less than 10 percent of a single cow. For those reasons and more, several wolf researchers told me they remain skeptical that ever-increasing wolf killings will chart the path to coexistence. “If it’s not going to reduce conflict, or make you feel better about wolves, why do you want to kill wolves?” Naomi Louchouarn, a conservation ecologist with Humane World for Animals, told me.

Although some advocates for increased wolf harvests can point to an ideal—and low—number of wolves they’d like to aim for, the conservationists I spoke with didn’t feel comfortable identifying a “correct” number of wolves for the country. The answer, Sanchez told me, depends less on what the landscape can support and more on what Americans’ attitudes will. But people who want more wolves and people who want fewer both argue that the other side is letting their feelings about wolves get in the way of rational thinking. Fielder, while making the case that Montana needed fewer wolves, repeatedly told me that the worst way to approach wolf management was “entirely through emotion.” Days earlier, while advocating for the animals, Boyd, the wildlife biologist, had told me exactly the same.</div>

            <h2>The Disappointment of Young Trump Voters</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/gen-z-trump-red-wave/686006/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The past two months have been some of the worst for Donald Trump’s approval rating—ever. Polling aggregators have his net approval in the low 40s, with 34 percent approval on the economy and 30 percent on cost of living. In individual polls, his overall approval dips down into the mid 30s. The last time Trump’s numbers looked this bad was right after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. George W. Bush exited the White House with similar ratings.

The slippage is especially drastic with young voters. In the 2024 election, a majority of 18-to-29-year-olds voted for Kamala Harris, but compared with 2020, young voters swung hard toward Trump. According to the Cook Political Report, on March 1, 2025, Trump’s net approval rating with these voters was minus 7. Yet by February 1 of this year, it was an astonishing minus 31.8. Now young people are abandoning Trump faster than any other voting bloc.

It’s tempting to think that this is all happening because of this administration’s blatantly authoritarian and norm-shattering actions: deploying masked ICE agents into American cities, stonewalling on the Epstein files, demolishing the East Wing, capturing Venezuela’s president, sharing racist videos on social media. All of those actions matter, and are slowly chipping away at Trump’s base of support.

But they’re not the whole story—or even the main story—of why Trump is losing young people. I run focus groups with voters every week, and what I’ve heard from this age group is much simpler: Trump is not doing the things that he told Americans he would do to fix prices and the economy. In the focus groups, young people who voted for Trump have said that they believed him during the campaign when he promised to “build the greatest economy in the history of the world.” Now they say they feel duped and let down.

Jean M. Twenge: The myth of the Gen Z red wave

“ There are things that are very disappointing and very rough right now,” Kim, a Generation Z Trump voter from Virginia, said during a focus group last month. (To protect participants’ privacy, we do not identify them by their last name.)

“Overall, I think the job market is really hard right now,” Allison, from New York, said.

“I think things are pretty chaotic lately, honestly,” said Lizabel, from Florida. “You just see all this stuff on the news, and you see a lot of people are struggling to find jobs. A lot of people are feeling kind of pessimistic about what things are going on.”

For these young people to have placed their faith in a con man like Trump might seem naive. But most members of Generation Z were still children when Trump came down the escalator. They don’t remember a lot of the chaos and dysfunction of Trump’s first run for president, or even his first term. They don’t view Trump as sui generis or beyond the pale, because he’s been the dominant force in our politics for as long as they’ve been politically aware.

Now, though, they’re young adults entering the workforce. Many of them have student loans, and they’re at a particularly cost-sensitive point in their lives. They notice when a politician like Trump promises to lower prices, and then doesn’t deliver.

In 2024, Trump overperformed with young voters to a historic degree. Harris beat him by 19 points among 18-to-29-year-olds—which sounds good until you realize that, in 2016, Hillary Clinton won the same cohort by 30 points. And in 2020, Joe Biden won them by 26 points.

Compared with 2020, in 2024 young voters swung to Trump in every key battleground state except Georgia. That includes a 24-point swing in Michigan, an 18-point swing in Pennsylvania, and a 15-point swing in Wisconsin. About 56 percent of young men voted for Trump in 2024, the same share that voted for Biden in 2020. Trump’s overall youth support jumped 10 points relative to his performance in 2020.

That shift was observable in real time over the course of the campaign, particularly in red-pilled corners of the internet, the right-leaning spaces where young people get more and more of their political news. Trump popped up on bro podcasts with Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Adin Ross, and Lex Fridman, as well as on shows such as Full Send and All-In. He threw an unhinged Madison Square Garden rally just days before his election, in which one of his supporters called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” The red-Solo-cup energy that sustains MAGA was in full effect, and America’s youngest voters—especially young men—were drawn in.

“For our generation right now, it’s a lot more acceptable for a guy to just be outright Republican and love Trump,” Gabrielle, in Florida, said in a recent focus group. “When you went on social media the day after the election, every single guy was able to just put on their story pictures of Trump winning the election, and like excitement, and all this stuff.”

During the Biden years, young people felt burned by the administration’s messaging on the economy. Ethan, from North Carolina, said in a February 2025 focus group that there was a constant stream of “Oh, the economy is getting better” sentiment from the Biden administration. “Meanwhile everyone knows that McDonald’s now costs $20 for a meal,” he said.

Young people like these were receptive when Trump said he would bring down prices and tame inflation, fix America’s broken health-care system, make housing affordable, create millions of new jobs, and do away with other economic woes that were plaguing many Americans, but that felt especially acute for young voters just entering the job market. The young people in my focus groups talk about how their student-loan debt is rising, housing is out of reach, and looming AI-powered disruption makes many jobs feel precarious. They’re clear-eyed that they might not be as well off as their parents’ generation.

Over the past 13 months, though, America’s young people have watched as Trump did a whole lot of things that weren’t what they elected him to do. Relative to when Trump took office, housing prices are up, job growth is stagnant, inflation has been persistent, college is less affordable, and people are more likely to be uninsured. That, more than anything else, is why young people in the focus groups say they’re disappointed.

“They could definitely be going better,” Alexandre, from Maryland, said last month, when we asked him how he thought things were going in the country—the “main cause being inflation and economic reasons,” he said.

“ I do not think we’re going super strongly, domestically. My biggest concerns are affordability,” said Sam, from Minnesota. “I have a job, but the unemployment rate for youth, and a lot of my friends getting jobs, is really hard.”

Derek Thompson: How COVID pushed a generation of young people to the right

“ From an economics factor, so many of the things that I would say are not wants, but instead needs, have just absolutely skyrocketed,” Joseph, from Michigan, said in September. “And basic families are spending so much on just the cost of living that they don’t have a cost to save, or anything like that. There’s just no financial way out.”

All of this suggests that Trump didn’t own the votes of young people who supported him in 2024; he rented them. And many of them are now getting tired of antics that, in their minds, take the focus away from the economy. When we asked a recent group about Trump’s threats against Greenland, Mukesh, a Trump voter from California, said: “I think we should just respect it, and leave it, and just focus on what’s actually happening inside the nation.”

What happens to these young voters now? That’s up to Democrats. I’m no policy hand, but I do know something about communications. Based on what I’ve heard in the focus groups, Democrats have a big opportunity with young people, because they’re some of the latest arrivals to Trump’s coalition. Democrats need to offer these voters a platform that addresses their concerns, while hammering Trump for his failure to do so.

In a recent focus group, the moderator asked Ruben, a Trump voter in Georgia, what advice he would give Democrats. He said: “ I’d say put a larger focus on the economic development. A lot of people these days are really coming of age, like being able to vote. And the younger Generation Z, we care about our finances, being able to pay rent, being able to afford food.”

These young people want someone who sees the economic pain they’re going through, and promises to actually do something about it. They don’t want policy papers. They want hope, good vibes, the red-Solo-cup energy—but directed toward what actually matters to them.</div>

            <h2>Crypto Is a Victim of Its Own Success</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/crypto-crash-bitcoin-value/685994/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The past few months have been disastrous for cryptocurrencies. Even after bouncing back a bit on Friday, bitcoin is now down almost 50 percent from its all-time high in October, and other cryptocurrencies—including well-established ones such as ethereum and solana—have fallen far further. Crypto winters are nothing new: The biggest drop in bitcoin’s history, in 2011, knocked 99 percent off its value. But this one feels especially painful, because it came at a moment when crypto enthusiasts thought they had finally made it.

Donald Trump’s election finally gave the industry a president who was avowedly crypto-friendly. Trump appointed regulators who, unlike those under Joe Biden, showed no interest in limiting crypto’s spread or cracking down on crypto exchanges. In October, he pardoned the founder of the biggest crypto exchange, Binance, who had been convicted of violating U.S. law by failing to adequately prevent money laundering on the site. Trump even put out a crypto coin of his own days before his inauguration—the value of which, like most meme coins, skyrocketed before collapsing.

Crypto seemed well served by the fact that it had become more enmeshed than ever into the global financial system, and more mainstream in terms of public awareness and interest. The assumption was that this would make bitcoin, and crypto generally, more stable and reliable, and protect it from the vicious sell-offs of the past. But in fact, its integration into the financial system, which helped boost bitcoin last year, has helped accelerate its fall.

David Frum: How crypto could trigger the next financial crisis

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. The growth of crypto exchanges such as Binance had made trading bitcoin and other currencies much easier for retail investors, as did a boom in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which let investors not only buy and sell crypto but leverage their bets.

Institutional investors were also more open to treating crypto as a legitimate asset class, and adding bitcoin to their portfolios. And there was a boom in what are known as digital-asset-treasury companies: publicly traded companies whose main business was raising capital to buy crypto, and who presented their strategy as a kind of perpetual money-making machine. Buying crypto drove up the stocks of these companies, allowing them to then sell stock to raise more money to buy crypto, which drove their stock up.

These were all things that seemed bullish for crypto—until the market turned. Take those leveraged ETFs. They’re designed to give investors, say, double bitcoin’s returns when it rises. But that means investors suffer double bitcoin’s losses when it falls, which amplifies sell-offs as people bail out. Institutional investors, meanwhile, are less likely to be true believers, and therefore more likely to sell when prices start to tumble. As for those digital-asset-treasury companies, their stocks have been demolished along with crypto, which makes raising capital to buy bitcoin much trickier, if not impossible. Those companies had been a steady source of demand for bitcoin. That demand has now dried up.

More generally, the institutionalization of crypto has left the currencies without a clear hook to bring new buyers in. The psychological fervor that pushed up crypto prices has always depended on the currencies’ reputation for being radical and disruptive. As crypto has become more established, investors looking for excitement have moved on to alternatives such as prediction markets, which are both more novel and more comprehensible than crypto.

That’s why analysts and investors now say things like “The narrative has stalled” and lament the lack of a “new story” to help explain why crypto is stuck. There’s nothing to galvanize people into buying crypto now, no obvious catalyst that would make people think, I better enter that market. It hardly helps that other investments have offered higher returns with less risk: Bitcoin has actually underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years, despite being far more volatile. So the mainstreaming of crypto has, ironically, made it harder, not easier, for it to rebound quickly, the way it has so often before.

Listen: How crypto is used for political corruption

This decline in sentiment and interest is especially important because crypto’s value depends not on any meaningful economic fundamentals, the way the value of a stock does, but rather on how people feel about it. The traditional “fundamental” case for bitcoin has been that because its supply is permanently capped at 21 million coins, it can serve as a hedge against inflation in traditional currencies such as the dollar. But the geopolitical turmoil, economic uncertainty, and drop in the value of the dollar relative to other major currencies in recent months have undermined this case. If bitcoin truly served as a hedge, then its value should have risen sharply. Instead, its value plummeted. That’s because bitcoin is not a hedge: It’s a speculative asset, which is valuable solely because people think it is valuable.

To be sure, plenty of people still think bitcoin is valuable: A currency that was trading at barely more than $0 in 2010 is now valued at nearly $69,000 a coin. And it has always bounced back after steep sell-offs before. But this is a new world for crypto, one in which digital currencies feel less like rebel upstarts and more like an eccentric uncle. Everyone expects crypto to either keep tumbling or rebound sharply. But predicting what comes next is impossible because its fundamental worth relies too heavily on storytelling, and its advocates haven’t found a new story to sell.</div>

There is also going to be lag while companies offload their talent onto AI. If those companies are expecting their human talent to retain their abilities, they might be wrong in that expectation. Telling their talent to siphon off their work to AI is only going to cause them to lose their intellectual edge. Use it or lose matters when it comes to brains and their use.

Apple hardware is currently not overpriced, quite the opposite. That&#39;s because Apple Silicon is really efficient, especially if you take energy consumption into account. Check out the Mac mini for example. I was considering buying a laptop recently and considered the framework laptops, then I saw that the apple laptops are better by most (not all) criteria and also cheaper.

Regardless of pricing, does anyone considering a framework laptop really also consider a Macbook ? The whole point of the Framework is modularity/expandability.  Whereas a Macbook is completely locked down hardware.

I don&#39;t have a preference. No one makes a laptop with a left handed trackball for me. Maybe some day Framework will allow it.

Most all laptops can swap the touchpad buttons, but the poster stated &quot;trackball&quot; and not touchpad.  That&#39;s a whole different thing and not generally found on consumer laptops.

If we are talking about a keyboard trackball, A touchpoint controller is way better than a trackball if you allow yourself to get used to it.  The cursor can be moved the full extent of multiple screens with constant pressure.  With a trackball you have to do many swipes eventually.

I know several people who have frameworks just because they think itâ(TM)s nice hardware.  The upgradability is just a nice bonus for them.  So yes, they were considering Macs too.

But you have to fight Apple to do anything not authorized by Apple, like run a different OS, or upgrade the hardware in any meaningful way. Even with the current RAM/SSD pricing issues, is the TCO better? Apple charges a lot for upgrades and they can only be bought up front, so no adding some cheap RAM and a big SSD five years down the line.

I think we generally agree. Buying a framework laptop means being willing to pay more for modularity, which might translate to cost benefits in the distant future. Considering to buy one is balancing whether it&#39;s worth the price now. What I&#39;m saying is that Apple Silicon is weighing further in that balance. Apple used to be expensive relative to the PC market, at least when disregarding hardware robustness and life expectancy; nowadays I don&#39;t think it&#39;s still true. Which is why I disagreed with OP saying i

I have not upgraded the ram or the storage. So overall it wasn&#39;t that expensive for me, in hindsight. I&#39;m sure some PC laptops last that long, but I know it&#39;s not the norm. And nowadays the buying price of Apple laptops is relatively lower than it used to be (at least that is my perception, taking other things like inflation and competition into account). I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s generally accurate to say that Apple hardware is over priced. Right now, you get much better hardware for significantly less money, and upgraded ram and storage in five years won&#39;t be enough to compensate for that. Battery life is also significantly in favour of Apple, and that won&#39;t be solved with modularity.

I have a 2021 M1max macbook (32GB). It has enough battery life to last (even now years later) well over 24 hours of actual use, it is faster than my brand new work lenovo (which also can keep my coffee warm and drown out all background noise while doing whatever it does while it&#39;s idling) and still provides more compute and memory than I need for any of the things I do.

I have no plans to replace it in the next few years and I find that a great investment. I would never buy a x86_64 machine for personal use.

All the ARM ones have the RAM soldered not just to the motherboard, but to the CPU substrate. Upgrading involves removing the chips with hot air rework.

I think the desktop ones still have some storage upgrade options, but the laptops are all soldered SSDs now I believe.

That&#39;s because Apple Silicon is really efficient, especially if you take energy consumption into account.Mostly due merely because Apple used to hog the finest process(*) available at TSMC (e.g. producing their M chips on &quot;3nm&quot; process while AMD uses &quot;5nm&quot; for their flagship), not as much due to some magic design skills.And BTW, with the current AI bubble, this advantage of Apple is going to evaporate as now the silicon fabs are going to prioritize buyers with even more (investors&#39;, not income) money to burn on the latest and bestest processes. Within a year or so, you could expect the &quot;really efficient, especially if you take energy consumption into account&quot; title will go to some custom AI chipsets by Nvidia and co (server CPUs, datacenter GPUs and NPUs, rack&#39;s ultra-high bandwidth interconnects, etc.) mass-produced on crazy scale to fill the &quot;promised&quot; continent-spanning datacenters that the big AI companies accounce in their arm&#39;s race to outcompete each-other exaflops-wise; and Apple will slide back to &quot;Yet another CPU manufacturer&quot;.---(*) note: that still partially(**) explains the high price...(**) note: but Apple still has ginormous margins compared to the cost of parts.

I buy 3 years of apple care when I buy a macbook. Then it&#39;s nothing if it dies. If it dies outside of 3 years it has lasted longer than any work machine running windows I&quot;ve been provided. That said I&#39;ve personally never had one fail. My 2021 macbook pro is happily my daily laptop and is as fine as the day i bought it. My wife really really needs to trade in her intel macbook but she refuses. I think that will get forced this year because apple will no longer provide OS updates.

I think the problem in the article is that the people installing Linux on a ARM Mac didn&#39;t set their expectations low enough.

The expectation should have been that of Gentoo, where you install everything from source, and never expect an ARM build.Same with the &quot;No external monitor without HDMI&quot;... how else did you expect to cconnect it? USB? DisplayLink is a proprietary standard. HDMI/DP over USB-C? Ask Nintendo why they don&#39;t standardize that either. You likely need in a Mac connect a real USB-C or TB docki

The few cases Iâ(TM)ve met for this are closed source software someone wants to run like the Minecraft server for example (which is a shame, because it needs single core performance where Appleâ(TM)s CPUs excel).  The best way to deal with that on an AppleSilicon Mac is to run Linux in a VM on top of Appleâ(TM)s virtualisation framework.  Then you can use Rosetta to run it.

I would probably run Linux if I had the time to set it up on my gaming PC as gaming is all I use it for these days.But since running Windows 11, I have migrated back to MacOS, I can run all the tools I need for my work. SSH, web brower based tools, Office 365 that customers use to communicate(incl Teams), Teamviewer etc etc.Windows is a mess and I swapped back to Mac. If it wasn&#39;t because i work 12 hours a day, I would probably start checking Linux as a desktop again.

Yeh, except that at least at the moment, Macs are the cheepest things out there.  Even their normally exorbitant memory prices are âoereasonableâ just now because PC RAM prices have gone so nuts.

It did seem like a very odd thing to want to do, people pay the huge premium for Apple Give us the numbers of what you call a huge premium. You must have the numbers amirite? Dollars for similar machines of similar performance. 

Define huge. I would define huge as 3 times the price for similar performance. Including manufacturer trade in, and length of service. 

You of course can use a different metric, but I&#39;m asking the expert here.

And useful if you want to dual boot something other than windows, but if all you want is a version if *nix just stick with MacOS. It has its quirks and the use of objective C for a lot of system calls is royal PITA if you&#39;re a C/C++ dev like me, but other than that it has little benefit over linux if you just want a nix enviroment and I write as someone who uses and develops on both in a daily basis.

I admin a bunch of Linux servers and workstations, and my daily driver for that has been a Mac. Admittedly mine is a simpler use case than what you&#39;re doing - I mean, mostly I just need a terminal, python to run ansible, ssh, and I like bbedit for editing - but macOS works as well as Linux for my particular use case.

My biggest complaint is - I feel like Apple&#39;s software quality has been gradually trending downhill over the past decade or more. The hardware engineering is still first-rate, but the OS and Apple-developed tools are just &#39;meh&#39; at best. Some of the Tahoe bugs, even at 26.3, are absurd... which is why I&#39;m sticking w/ Sonoma as long as it gets support.

But as to the actual topic: The Asahi folks are quite clear regarding what works and what doesn&#39;t work, and with which Apple processors. None of that should&#39;ve been a surprise for the author, IMHO.

I admin a bunch of Linux servers and workstations, and my daily driver for that has been a Mac. Admittedly mine is a simpler use case than what you&#39;re doing - I mean, mostly I just need a terminal, python to run ansible, ssh, and I like bbedit for editing - but macOS works as well as Linux for my particular use case.

My biggest complaint is - I feel like Apple&#39;s software quality has been gradually trending downhill over the past decade or more. The hardware engineering is still first-rate, but the OS and Apple-developed tools are just &#39;meh&#39; at best. Some of the Tahoe bugs, even at 26.3, are absurd... which is why I&#39;m sticking w/ Sonoma as long as it gets support.

But as to the actual topic: The Asahi folks are quite clear regarding what works and what doesn&#39;t work, and with which Apple processors. None of that should&#39;ve been a surprise for the author, IMHO.

Apple&#39;s software (and hardware) quality has been bad for ages, it&#39;s just that the Reality Distortion Field is down and the shiny marketing is wearing off as everyone has become acclimatised to it. Basically people are now seeing Apple products for what they are, overpriced.

Tried it a year ago, tried it again recently. Even on an M1 macbook, hardware still isn&#39;t supported or is poorly supported. Performance is poor, battery life is bad, you can&#39;t use all the hardware. You&#39;re much better served by selling it and buying a cheaper laptop with full Linux support.

&#39;I Tried Running Linux On an Apple Silicon Mac and Regretted It&#39;

The difficulties described are consequences of Apple’s proprietary platform design, not evidence that Linux or ARM are immature ecosystems. Conflating ISA compatibility with platform openness is a fundamental misunderstanding of how hardware enablement works.

“Linux doesn’t feel ready for ARM yet. Many apps aren’t compiled for ARM.”

This is the weakest argument in the article.

Billions of Android devices (Linux kernel)Most cloud hyperscalers (Graviton, Ampere)Raspberry Pi ecosystemEmbedded and industrial systemsMajor distros eg:Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian have mature AArch64 support.

And today most open-source software compiles cleanly for ARM64.Browsers, compilers, containers, dev tools are fully native.Even Steam supports ARM via translation layers.

The real issue is x86-only proprietary binaries.

That’s not Linux-on-ARM immaturity.That’s legacy x86 ecosystem inertia.

Even Apple solves this via Rosetta — a translation layer.Linux uses FEX or box64 for similar purposes.

Translation instability  platform immaturity.

The real issue is x86-only proprietary binaries.Thatâ(TM)s not Linux-on-ARM immaturity.Thatâ(TM)s legacy x86 ecosystem inertia.Or, worse yet, software with &quot;features&quot; that actively screw you from working in anything other than winsh1t, often DRM.

Think about how people actually want to use their computers. They want to be able to play Steam games, for example. They want to be able to run a few apps under WINE maybe, or some commercial software that is only distributed as a binary. Even some of the open source stuff can have issues on ARM, as I have found with embedded Raspberry Pi stuff.

Whatever the reason, whoever is to blame, the bottom line for the user is that stuff doesn&#39;t work.

Linux can be good with older 2nd hand Macs.

In 2017 a friend was throwing away their 2007 iMac (an Intel-based computer-in-a-monitor model). I installed Ubuntu on it and used it for a while as a home desktop computer - nothing too heavy. I liked using Ubuntu on what felt like a solid, well designed computer.

...and need binary components for certain popular packages (database connectors, system-level bindings, etc.). They either don&#39;t exist or you&#39;ve got to build them from scratch just to realise that you can&#39;t because they don&#39;t support arm.

....It just isn&#39;t ready for ARM-powered Macs, perhaps. ARM-based systems aren&#39;t tied to standards to the same degree x86 systems are. Thus one has to be more careful and ensure their hardware is supported. It&#39;s like Linux back in the mid-&#39;90s on Intel.

&quot;External monitors don&#39;t work unless your MacBook has a built-in HDMI port.&quot;

That means I can use a Thunderbolt-attached monitor with my MBP that has an HDMI port, right?  What, no, it really means &quot;External monitors only work via built-in HDMI port&quot; and &quot;This article was written poorly&quot;?  I am shocked, shocked.

It&#39;s worth noting that there are plenty of ways to run Linux virtual machines/containers under MacOS (Parallels, Fusion, QEMU/UTM, Ubuntu Multipass, Docker, Orbstack,...)  which largely avoid the hardware support problems of trying to run Linux on bare, Apple Silicon, metal & let you run most of the major Linux distros (which have Arm64 versions) and container systems.

Plus, MacOS is Unix so it&#39;s a relatively easy port for Linux software:  A large proportion of the major open source Unix/Linux projects c

And add the words &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot;.

That will be superfluous, there&#39;s already &#39;advertisement&#39; there :)

Effective ads is already an impossibility.AI effective is just mind blowingly impossible.they can make ads for other AIs, yes, but that would not be called an ad.

It would be hilarious if AI agents led advertising clients to discover that ads rarely actually get people to buy enough things to justify the cost of the ad.And the entire advertising echosystem collapses. Won&#39;t happen, but would be funny.

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re starting a new business - say, an online webstore, offering something with an extra particular appeal to some particular group vs. their preexisting options.  Precisely zero people know about your webstore.  What exactly is your plan without some form of advertising - just hope that people randomly stumble into it and tell all their friends?

To be clear, advertising doesn&#39;t just mean &quot;banner ads&quot;, it can be all sorts of things. Maybe you give a Youtube influencer who makes videos on subjects

we don&#39;t want effective ads.We don&#39;t want ads at all.

Then be ready to pay for the content you&#39;re consuming.

That content is now mostly ads, interspersed with AI hallucinations. Put up as many paywalls as you like.

You&#39;re consuming content literally as we speak.

Every advancement put forth by Big Tech ever since the dotcom boom has been about advertising and marketing. Their goal is to optimize personalized mattress sales.

Their actual goal is to profit from consumer surplus.

As Willy Horton observed about banks, for most Big Tech companies, advertising is their primary source of revenue.  So it&#39;s no surprise they&#39;d look to increase the profitability (reducing costs, increasing &quot;effectiveness&quot;) for advertising.

My question remains &quot;Who actually reads those ads?&quot; and more importantly &quot;Who responds to all the shit on websites?&quot;  (I don&#39;t...)

This is a simple rule to live by - if you see advertising, start by assuming you don&#39;t need it.  If it&#39;s for a brand, assume that brand is overcharging you.  If you see product placements or informal/influencer content, assume that&#39;s a paid advertisement.  Think very carefully about what you need, make a shopping list and monitor the prices, so you know when to buy (and give yourself a cooldown to avoid impulse buying - if you haven&#39;t needed it while waiting for a special, maybe you don&#39;t need it at all).

not only a good idea. It&#39;s a necessity from the IT security point of view.

Why no use adblock ?Don&#39;t waste your time on ads.

Advertisers have moved away from tracking everyone ?   I believe that as much as a believe the content of their ad copy.

Searches are increased because of AI  ?  Yes, because they are using AI to make searching more difficult.

You&#39;re telling me that now companies are trying to sell people things that they might want to buy? Oh noes! How horrible!

And on top of it all, statistically-generated misinformation.

Nobody can find *hit on the first search, so they have to click again. You are sucked into clicking on &quot;classic search&quot;, &quot;people also ask&quot;, &quot;click here to open&quot;, to try to get away from Google Spam and all that then counts as two searches for Google.

Building consumer profiles and creating new and better ways to shove ads down your throat is what the tech industry is all about. Social media, cookie tracking, free email - itâ(TM)s always been about serving ads. If its free you are the product

When are people going to figure out that, while AI can be useful, it needs significant oversight - oversight performed by people who know what they&#39;re doing?

Quit believing what you&#39;re told by the tech bros who are trying to build a fortune on top of &quot;AI&quot;!

Okay, but I&#39;m not sure that it rises to the level of interesting. But Slashdot doesn&#39;t have any dimension of moderation that encourages solutions, my ongoing focus.

So here&#39;s my solution in the form of an attempted joke: Alien style. That&#39;s the unpeople from outer space, not human foreigners.

So first we train the generative AIs for the style of aliens, and then we require them to talk that way. It would always be clear (IOttMCO) when an AI was talking.

And a top of the klaatu barada nikto to you, too.

The problem is in cases like this where &quot;oversight&quot; would have taken just as much time as not using the AI to begin with.

A lot of coders can save time with AI because oftentimes &quot;checking the work&quot; means running a function. You test it the same way you would had you written it yourself.

But with writing, &quot;checking the work&quot; means doing the research that you were trying to avoid by using an AI. In the example from the article, he tried to use the AI to extract and organize quotes. If he had used the AI to do

It very literally doesn&#39;t.  It is far faster to do &quot;Here&#39;s a giant e-book, find me five quotations from it that relate to the concept of paranoia&quot; and then to do ctrl-f in the e-book and search for the provided wording, than to read the whole damned book and thinking about whether every sentence applies to paranoia.

Also, describing the quotes in context here as &quot;hallucinated&quot; or &quot;fake&quot; is deeply misleading to readers.  The quotes were summarized / paraphrased versions of what was actually said.  The author

The oversight needs to be so significant, that admitting it would almost completely nullify the usefulness and consequently the value of all &quot;investment&quot;.

The trumpistani &quot;journalism&quot; has been feeding from the corporate hand  for a long time and is completely corrupted by it, so you&#39;re not going to see much critical thinking involved in the coverage of the subject.

The AI overlords will not forget this incident.

The &quot;AI Overloads&quot; don&#39;t give a sh*t.  All they care about is money.

The unfortunate part of the story is that before this story came out, we readers had no way to know ArsTechnica was publishing AI-generated stories.  (In fact, their stated policy was that they did *not* use AI).

What working writers should do is to form a nonprofit organization, create a simple but distinctive banner that declares &quot;This news source is free of AI-generated content&quot;, and then *trademark* the banner so that it can only be used with permission.  Sites that commit to a &quot;no AI&quot; policy get to use the banner free of charge.  Sites that don&#39;t have such a policy don&#39;t get to use it, and sites that are caught lying (like ArsTechnica) get their right to use the banner revoked.

Not sure what Dorsey has to do with Bluesky (he was an important player in its history, but has had nothing to do with it for years, and doesn&#39;t even have an active account there).  TL/DR, he found that most of the people there hated him (and things he&#39;s interested in, like crypto), and regularly got trolled when posting on the site.

If you show up at work sick, you do less, and make more mistakes, but mostly you&#39;ll give your illness to others. You openly cough in the conference room and you get sent home.It is a wee bit of an over reaction but following covid nobody wants to take a chance.

I think a great deal of the outrage being expressed against ArsTechnica is a manifestation of the pent up rage many of us feel towards the AI slop we&#39;re being force fed from all directions into all of our orifices. That rage will subside, and ArsTechnica will continue. Benj, on the other hand, will likely suffer more than he deserves for his overzealous and often credulous cheerleading of AI. Of all people, he should have understood its limitations.

The Gell-Mann amnesia effect [wikipedia.org] is at full power here.

When a journo fucks up something only you know something about, you still keep on trusting the reporting on stuff you know little about. But when a journo fucks up something obvious that everyone can see is obviously wrong....did the tree really make a sound?

In my experience. Requesting reference links is also useless. Even if provided, they are either 404 or unrelated.

You need to use a separate tool for verification, like a proper search engine.

They&#39;re not fake AI-generated quotes  AI actually generated these.  They&#39;re real AI-generated quotes.

Or did they mean &quot;fake, AI-generated quotes&quot;?  Commas matter.  There are books written about this.

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot;

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot; Agreed [slashdot.org]!

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot;

&quot;...At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.&quot;

Yes, just one of thousands and thousands of &#39;isolated incidents&#39;. There&#39;s no pattern whatsoever. Don&#39;t worry your pretty little head about it.

And that name should have been in the Slashdot blurb.

Being sorry for something implies feeling. Sorry, datacenters full of chips do not feel. We need to stop talking about these clankers like they are human, and see them for what they are and not the charade they perform.

... I still think that news stories about what actual humans say on social media are stupid. Have thought so ever since that practice started.

Now we have news stories about what AI agents &quot;say&quot; on social media?

While researchers are looking everywhere for productivity boost from AI, it is lurking here right under their nose. In all those unintended messes AI agents build and all the extra cones and rods dedicated to AI oversight.

We are creating a too big to fix system. Bravo!

I would imagine that having your lead rival completely self-own themselves doesn&#39;t hurt either.

Cool, now that we&#39;ve got the obligatory mean-girl style personal attack out of the way, is he wrong?

Would you claim that Musk loudly and publicly allying himself with Trump, the GOP, DOGE, and various ultra-right-wing European political groups, and regularly spouting off online like a 13-year-old 4chan edgelord, was a wise course of action, when he&#39;s also the person in charge of a company whose income stream depends on selling electric vehicles to environmentally-conscious liberals?

Or people have been told for half a century that trickle down, laissez faire capitalism would make us all prosperous. And all the while, Republicans and Democrats have been shaking hands to send our jobs over seas.

Tuition is up, housing is less affordable, and unsecured debt is way up. Opportunities to move up are far fewer than they once were for the working class. The quality of life for the bottom 50% has plummeted while our cities have turned into something worse than the shithole countries we used to invade.

There is no Marxism in America to even rail against. It&#39;s dead. Democrats walked away from unions and now embrace Wall St. You saw Harris tell us the economy was great under Biden because the stock market went up. Middle America called B.S. because most people don&#39;t have stocks!

The whole red scare is lies and propaganda to distract Americans from the political elite picking our pockets. Somewhere along the way we forgot that the government works for the People. And I hope own day we all get on the same page and put the fear of God into these crooks.

You saw Harris tell us the economy was great under Biden because the stock market went up. Middle America called B.S. because most people don&#39;t have stocks!That&#39;s a defense against the republicans trying to say the economy went backwards under Biden.Heck even Bondi tried to use the DOW being up as a defence in her congressional hearings recently, and those hearings are about human trafficking!I digress - sometimes you can fight fire with fire if everyone in your audience doesn&#39;t know any better.

That&#39;s not how market caps work. If you recall, Amazon didn&#39;t make a profit until its 10th year, and then, it was tiny. Compared to its market cap, that profit was infinitesimally small. This is because in the first decade, Amazon&#39;s investors plowed tons of money into the company to build it up. Since then, their profits have soared, reducing its P/E ratio to about 27x. Rivian&#39;s profits will likewise grow, unless they mismanage the business or calamity strikes, bring the P/E ratio to a more reasonable numbe

It shows they are moving in the right direction, and unlike Tesla it&#39;s not built on a cult of personality or bullshit promises about full self driving appreciating assets. It&#39;s just a solid business with a solid product, making a profit relatively early compared to other startups too.

Rivian&#39;s profits are from their software that VW purchased.Their cars are ranked as the most unreliable cars in the United States, unfortunately.

Rivian isn&#39;t that bad. Consumer Reports counts every minor problem and tallies that up for a reliability score. So the transmission in your Ford can grenade itself and that counts the same as a Rivian having a squeaky dashboard.

This is a lie.Covered in their FAQ (https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/consumer-reports-car-reliability-faq-a1099917197/)

&quot;They use a weighted system that prioritizes issues based on severity, safety, and potential to cause a vehicle to be taken out of service.&quot;

I have a friend who is a big Rivian advocate and will talk your ear off about how awesome the brand is while admitting that his actual vehicle is an unreliable piece of shit.

Such a serious clampdown would probably stifle legitimate criticism of the government or views that are &quot;wrong&quot; to avoid fines.  Ultimately, the government can control the message by claiming &quot;manipulation.&quot;You&#39;re familiar with India, right? 

Modi has no intention of letting go of power. They&#39;re a democracy in name only. 

As much as I think that Social Media corporations need to be held to account, this is just blatant over-reach and utterly pointless as the government has little power outside their own borders, even China can&#39;t police the worlds internet content and not through lack of trying (the US will have exactly the same problem if it tried to do the same).

If platforms can&#39;t prevent AI slop and disinformation, then I question their need to exist, what value does a giant sack of trash offer?   The fight over what is illegal content should be waged, and then the results of that fight can be passed on to the platforms.  Making tech companies take some responsibility is the only way we might have a somewhat useable internet in a couple years.

The problem always come on how to implement this, and how to do it without having massive authoritarian abuse.

But they are trying, and it needs to be done.

We’re coming up on a big national anniversary, the (defiantly unspellable) semiquincentennial. To get in the spirit of things, I’ve been curled up with books about the founders, particularly George Washington, someone I became acquainted with when I wrote a book about him many years ago. But meanwhile, our current president has been honking away in the distance—a man difficult to abide and impossible to ignore.

Despite the glaring differences between Washington and Donald Trump in character, judgment, and historical significance, there are some interesting similarities. Born rich. Aggressive acquirers of real estate. Big-house guys. Thin-skinned, image-conscious. Extremely nationalistic: Trump’s message is Make America Great Again. Washington’s was … Make America.

So why will history judge them as polar opposites? In part because Washington readily and repeatedly gave up power. He did so conspicuously at the end of the War of Independence, then again after eight years as president. He lived in an era in which selflessness was considered one of the core virtues of a great leader, and at crucial moments in our history, he behaved accordingly.

Whereas Trump … well, he’s no George Washington. And he tells us so! He is instinctively royalist and brazenly self-aggrandizing. He repeatedly claims powers he does not legally have. He promiscuously puts his name on everything this side of the moon, and I probably shouldn’t even mention that particular satellite, lest he get ideas.

His decision to appoint himself as chair of the Kennedy Center was outrageous enough, but then he put his name on the place. He also put his name on the United States Institute of Peace, just a few blocks away. His face is all over D.C. now, on huge banners hanging from government buildings. He wants Dulles International Airport named for him, and also Penn Station. His open campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize was plenty dismaying, but then he threw one of his tantrums when he didn’t get laureated and, in an official letter to the leader of Norway, demanded Greenland in compensation. At this point, we know that Trump is going to be Trump, and if anything, he leans into the narcissism, becoming Trumpier by the day. Trump has learned that his most flamboyantly selfish behavior will likely be ignored or forgiven by his base and political allies. There is no one willing to tell him that You Can’t Do This.

Our nation was founded upon the principle that power derives from the people. We don’t like despots and dictators and monarchs or anything smacking of royalty. That was why the founders were very careful when they crafted the Constitution: The president is just one branch of government, is constrained by checks and balances, and can always be given the heave-ho.

Which takes us back to George Washington. Everyone knew he was going to be the first president—he was right there in the room, presiding, when the founders drew up the Constitution. But they were taking a chance, because no one really knew what a president was. Such a thing didn’t exist anywhere in the world. George Washington had to define the role through his actions.

What modern historians know is that selflessness didn’t come effortlessly to Washington. He had to will it, in tension with his natural, human desires.

This is a subtlety of Washington that Americans weren’t taught in elementary school, and I don’t think the A.I. bots have quite figured it out. A schoolkid asking an A.I. program for help with an essay about Washington will probably get highlights of the man’s consequential life, the first-in-war, first-in-peace stuff, and perhaps learn that he was an enslaver who, like the other founders, failed to end the vile institution of human bondage. But the child is unlikely to find out what Washington was really like. Here’s what ChatGPT produced when I asked it to “write an essay on George Washington’s personality”:

George Washington was a man of great integrity, character, and leadership. His personality was marked by a strong sense of duty, humility, and selflessness. … Despite his many accomplishments and successes, he remained humble and never sought accolades or praise for himself.

Oh, balderdash. Yes, Washington was indeed a man of integrity, character, and leadership. That led him to behave selflessly at critical moments during the founding of our country. But Washington desperately wanted to be a great man, and wanted to be remembered as such. He craved the approbation (one of his favorite words) of his peers and guarded his image as though it were the front line of a war. He sought, as multiple biographers have put it, “secular immortality.”

He didn’t wander into greatness: he pursued it, willed it, achieved it. He had a “monumental ego,” in the words of historian Joseph Ellis. Peter Henriques, an admirer of Washington who has recently published two insightful books on his character, writes that Washington “was not a ‘selfless’ man or one who was simply engaging in disinterested service. Rather, a pattern emerges of a man who was deeply ambitious, massively concerned with his reputation, and in regular search of the public approbation, even as he denied such desires.” This is not revisionist history. This is the man as he really was. Washington is so tied up with the narrative of American greatness and exceptionalism that some people may think it’s wrong to probe him too deeply. Why not just salute and move on? As Alexis Coe put it in her recent biography, “We haven’t been taught to think critically about Washington.”

His avaricious acquisitions of western lands is well known and not incidental to his desire to break from Great Britain, which had tried to limit western migration. When I wrote my book The Grand Idea, about Washington and his Potomac River schemes (he thought it would surely be the great commercial highway to the West), I was a bit shocked at his imperious behavior when he traveled across the mountains into what is now western Pennsylvania and confronted poor farmers who (he alleged) were squatting on his land. He sued them. He forced them to pull up stakes. He could be pretty high-and-mighty, and certainly not exactly a small-d democrat.

And yet his drive, his ambition, his hunger for glory were essential to the enterprise of wresting the colonies from the grip of distant overlords. And his desire for secular immortality didn’t mean he was pretending to have lofty republican sensibilities. He was anti-monarchical to the core.

Washington curated his reputation and polished it for the eyes of future generations. Shortly before his death, he wrote a will that broke apart his vast estate, including more than 50,000 acres of land, and set in motion the freeing of the enslaved people under his legal control (delaying manumission until the death of his wife). These were actions very consciously taken with the eyes of history upon him. He knew that slavery would be a permanent stain on his reputation. And he was right.

Early biographers helped advance the image of a godlike Washington. Most famously, Parson Weems invented from whole cloth the story about young Washington taking a hatchet to his father’s cherry tree, then confessing to it. The early chroniclers, including John Marshall (who fought under Washington’s command and later served as chief justice of the United States), delivered to the public the kind of man that the fragile young nation desired: an unblemished father figure, preposterously virtuous.

Go the Capitol rotunda and look up at the dome, where Constantino Brumidi’s fresco The Apotheosis of Washington, painted during the Civil War, shows Washington in heaven, flanked by goddesses. You have to strain to see him, way up there, high above this mortal coil. He’s a remote figure, unapproachable. Not like us.

Washington cared a lot about appearances and made sure that he presented himself as a formidable, dignified figure, not someone you’d slap on the back on a whim. He liked a bit of pomp and pizzazz as president. He was meticulous in ordering well-made clothes, and a “chariot” with some gilding wouldn’t be too excessive, he thought. But he had to be careful. If he acted too much like royalty, he’d get spanked by his peers and excoriated by anti-Federalist newspapers. “No Kings” was not just a protest sign in those days.

Human nature has not changed. There have always been people who desire wealth and power. They are never infallible or immune to misjudgment. What changes and evolves are the political ecosystems. Laws change, as do values, societal expectations, the means of communication, the technologies of political life. The norms. Norms can erode.

Trump, the opposite of an enigma, constantly tells us exactly who he is. He reveals this in late-night social media rants (“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”) and unguarded conversations caught on tape (“When you’re a star, they let you do it” and “I just want to find 11,780 votes”).

He is at least consistent in his message. He tells us, over and over, This is all about me. So of course when Rob Reiner and his wife were murdered, Trump immediately said the killings were linked to Reiner’s political opposition to him. His solipsism is nonnegotiable.

Historians will have an overwhelming job of compiling and organizing the confetti of royalist declarations from this president, but let’s simplify their work a bit. The most important moment, the defining one, is obvious: Trump refused to accept that he lost the 2020 election and—another example of action defining character—urged the vice president and an unruly mob to halt the peaceful transfer of power. That’s as un–George Washington as it gets. Washington knew he was part of something bigger than himself. He had helped create a nation, but it didn’t belong to him. So after eight years fashioning the office of the presidency, he did something simple and exemplary: He went home.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/02/pam-bondi-jeanine-pirro-pete-hegseth-donald-trump.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

If you want to check if your town is on the list, Andrea recommends checking out Project Salt Box.

            <div id="article-text">The US Federal Trade Commission has sent out a raft of civil investigative demands to Microsoft&#39;s competitors as it warms up a probe into whether the cloud and software giant has an illegal monopoly across chunks of the enterprise tech market.

Bloomberg reported over the weekend that the FTC had contacted at least half a dozen companies as part of the probe, presenting them with detailed questions on Redmond&#39;s licensing and business practices.

Whether Microsoft makes it difficult (or more costly) for customers to run its software on third-party cloud platforms appears to be a key question, though AI, security, and ID software are also on the agenda.

The FTC demanded stacks of info on Microsoft&#39;s AI operations in 2024, according to the report. This included model training costs, datacenter operations, and licensing practices.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority&#39;s investigation into the cloud services market concluded last summer.

It recommended the CMA flexes &quot;its digital markets powers to prioritize commencing strategic market status (SMS) investigations, to consider designating the two largest providers – Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS) – with SMS in relation to their respective digital activities in cloud services.&quot;

It also said it would &quot;keep under review possible options for further designation investigations, and anticipates that the CMA Board will consider options in early 2026.&quot;

A spokesperson confirmed: &quot;The CMA board expects to make a decision on which option to prioritize in the first quarter of this year.&quot;

The EU is also examining if Microsoft is abusing its dominant market position in traditional on-premises software as more enterprise customers consider shifting workloads to the cloud. Google made a complaint to the European Commission&#39;s antitrust authorities in September 2024.

The situation is reminiscent of the long-running battle with the US Department of Justice over whether Microsoft used its hefty desktop operating system market share to quash browser rivals back in the 1990s. That led to a consent decree where Microsoft agreed to a number of conditions to forestall a breakup of the organization.

Microsoft is not the only tech giant drawing attention from the FTC right now. Last week, FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, &quot;reminding him of Apple&#39;s obligations to its customers.&quot;

The letter came on the back of &quot;reports that Apple News systematically boosts left-wing sources and suppresses right-wing sources,&quot; the FTC said.

&quot;Big Tech companies that suppress or promote news articles in their news aggregators or feeds based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication may violate the FTC Act,&quot; Ferguson warned Cook. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA engineers spent the weekend studying the data after another attempt to fill the agency&#39;s monster Space Launch System (SLS) produced mixed results.

Dubbed a &quot;confidence test&quot; by NASA, the core stage of the SLS was partially filled with liquid oxygen to check out the newly replaced seals around where the propellant leaked in a recent Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR). According to NASA, &quot;Teams were able to gain confidence in several key objectives of the test,&quot; although things did not go entirely to plan.

One issue was a reduced flow of liquid hydrogen into the rocket, which engineers suspect was caused by a filter in ground support equipment. The component has now been replaced, although NASA has not said it plans to conduct a further confidence test before attempting a second WDR in February. The Artemis II mission, which will use this SLS, is set for launch in March at the earliest, with additional opportunities in April.

The agency said it had obtained data &quot;at the core stage interfaces, taken at the same time in the test where they encountered a leak during the previous wet dress rehearsal.&quot;

It added: &quot;Engineers will purge the line over the weekend to ensure proper environmental conditions and inspect the ground support equipment before replacing a filter suspected to be the cause of the reduced flow.&quot;

NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman used a post on X (formerly Twitter) to point out that problems were observed on the previous mission to the Moon: &quot;Considering the issues observed during the lead-up to Artemis I, and the long duration between missions, we should not be surprised there are challenges entering the Artemis II campaign.&quot;

Isaacman also made himself somewhat of a hostage to fortune with the comment, &quot;I will say near-conclusively for Artemis III, we will cryoproof the vehicle before it gets to the pad, and the propellant loading interfaces we are troubleshooting will be redesigned.&quot;

The engines of the SLS core stage are former Space Shuttle units, which run on liquid oxygen and hydrogen, meaning that NASA has plenty of experience at dealing with the stuff. However, the final Space Shuttle launch was in 2011, and the gap between SLS flights can be measured in years rather than months.

As for Artemis III, there is no guarantee it will launch during Isaacman&#39;s tenure. It could easily slip into the 2030s unless the mission profile is changed, as it requires a lander that NASA&#39;s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel fears will not be ready in time. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has quietly pushed out an emergency Chrome fix after attackers were caught exploiting the browser&#39;s first reported zero-day of 2026.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-2441 and assigned a &quot;high&quot; CVSS score of 8.8, stems from a use-after-free bug in Chrome&#39;s CSS handling that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside the browser&#39;s sandbox using a specially crafted HTML page. In other words, a dodgy webpage could be all an attacker needs to get malicious code running inside a victim&#39;s browser.

Unsurprisingly, Google has rushed out fixes for Chrome with version 145.0.7632.75 for Windows and Mac, and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, which the Chocolate Factory says will &quot;roll out in the coming days/weeks.&quot;

Security researcher Shaheen Fazim reported the flaw on February 11, and Google acknowledged that attackers were already exploiting it just two days later – though it&#39;s staying tight-lipped on the specifics. The company has not said whether the attacks were targeted or part of a broader exploitation campaign, only that the vulnerability was being abused before a fix was ready.

&quot;Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild,&quot; its security advisory stated.

Google said access to further details about the bug will remain under wraps until most users are patched, and potentially longer if third-party dependencies are involved, a standard move aimed at stopping others from quickly weaponizing the bug.

If this all feels a bit familiar, that&#39;s because it is. Google spent much of last year playing Whac-A-Mole with actively exploited Chrome bugs, ultimately patching eight zero-days across 2025.

The fix also lands days after researchers revealed that at least 287 Chrome extensions, with tens of millions of installs between them, were quietly siphoning off users&#39; browsing histories to a long list of outside recipients – a handy reminder that data can leak not just through software flaws but through the sprawling ecosystem bolted onto the browser. ®

            <div id="article-text">A former Windows boss has explained why the taskbar in Windows 11 is the way it is and how he &quot;fought hard&quot; to stop Microsoft from removing customization options present in Windows 10.

There are reports Microsoft is working on bringing back this functionality, though the Windows maker has not issued an official confirmation. However, Mikhail Parakhin, former CVP of Technology at Microsoft, explained the thinking behind the original decision to lock the taskbar in place.

Widgets were at least partially to blame.

&quot;The vision,&quot; Parakhin writes on X (formerly Twitter), &quot;was to create symmetric panes: you have notification/system controls/etc. pane on the right, Weather/Widgets/News pane on the left. That pushed start menu into the center position.

&quot;If you have taskbar vertically, it starts conflicting with the panes...&quot;

The taskbar in Windows 11 is located at the bottom of the screen. It cannot be moved or resized. It has also long been a bone of contention among many users of the operating system, who remember the days when the strip could be relocated. Parakhin writes, &quot;Windows had it since 95, that&#39;s how I use it my whole life.&quot;

It is possible to align the content of the taskbar to the left and also have it automatically disappear in Windows 11. However, moving the bar itself to the top, left, or right sides of the desktop is not supported.

Parakhin famously made that &quot;make Start menu great again&quot; post at the beginning of 2024, although the current state of the enlarged user interface component is unlikely what users had in mind. Microsoft also relentlessly pushed advertising into Windows during Parakhin&#39;s tenure as CEO of Advertising and Web Services from 2022 to 2024.

So there you have it. Microsoft decided to sacrifice Windows 10-levels of taskbar customization to, at least in part, inflict Widgets on users of its flagship operating system. For many, this will confirm that Microsoft spent the last few years stepping back from one of the original tenets of Windows – customization.

Even Copilot, whom many might say adds functionality that users haven&#39;t asked for, is critical of the direction of travel. When we gave it the prompt &quot;Should the taskbar of Windows be moveable?&quot; it came up with this response: &quot;A core principle of Windows has always been flexibility. Locking the taskbar to the bottom feels like a step backward in user control.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although we&#39;re in mid-February, the Linux Mint project just published its January 2026 blog. This could be seen as one sign of the pressure on the creator of this very successful distro: although the post talks about forthcoming improved input localization support and user management, it also discusses the pressures of the project&#39;s semi-annual release schedule.

The Mint project&#39;s latest post thanks a record-breaking 1,000 + donors, and talks about future plans – which may include a slower release schedule.

We covered the release of Linux Mint 22.3 in mid-January, and apparently it&#39;s been a hit. The Linux Mint project received an impressive 1,393 donations last month, totalling $47,312 (£34,713) – a new record, and aside from the controversial Distrowatch rankings, it is another decent measure of the distro&#39;s deserved popularity. The blog post also mentions new features that the development team are working on. These show the breadth of problems that a widely used distro faces.

The team is working on further improving Cinnamon&#39;s input method support, such as automatically switching keyboard layout when choosing a particular input method – Clement Lefebvre, founder, project leader and main developer of Linux Mint, gives the example of automatically switching to a Japanese layout when the user chooses mozc. Another cross-desktop issue is managing user accounts, and so the team is adding this feature to the new Mint System Administration tool that appeared in the latest version.

Work on official Wayland support in Cinnamon continues, and one issue the Mint team is taking on is screensaver support. Currently Cinnamon&#39;s screensavers only work if you&#39;re using X11. Quite simply, Wayland has no provision for screensavers. This is by design, and the creator of XScreensaver, the inimitable Jamie Zawinski, has discussed the problems with some feeling:

Wayland does not support screen savers: it does not have any provision that allows screen savers to even exist in any meaningful way. If you value screen savers, that&#39;s kind of a problem.

Why doesn&#39;t it? Well, I suppose the designers of Wayland have no joy in their cold, black hearts simply do not value screen savers.

It&#39;s worth a read – JWZ always is – and the struck-out text especially speaks to us. Notably, he discusses some of the issues with trying to add support for screensavers to a Wayland compositor.

With all these efforts going on – some of them substantial undertakings – it&#39;s no wonder that the developers are feeling the strain. The final section of the blog is titled Longer Development Cycle and talks about the pressure of Mint&#39;s semi-annual point releases, ending:

With a release every six months plus LMDE, we spend more time testing, fixing, and releasing than developing.

We&#39;re thinking about changing that and adopting a longer development cycle. As it happens, our next release will be based on a new LTS and we just ran out of codenames.

This wouldn&#39;t be the first time the Mint project has changed its release cycle. Linux Mint 1.0 &quot;Ada&quot; was based on Kubuntu 6.06, Canonical&#39;s first ever LTS release of Ubuntu. From then until Mint 16, which The Register reviewed in December 2013, Mint tracked all Ubuntu releases, including the interim ones. Since Mint 17 the following year, it switched to only offering versions based on Ubuntu LTS releases – but each major version is followed by point releases, which follow after the upstream point releases of Ubuntu LTS – and all of these receive long-term support, as does Ubuntu itself. It&#39;s a lot of maintenance work.

The Reg FOSS desk has looked at each release since Linux Mint 21 entered beta, and we have noticed that only the flavor with Mint&#39;s in-house Cinnamon desktop gets a new version of the desktop with each point release. In contrast, the Xfce and MATE editions stay with the version of the desktop that they shipped with, which they inherit from the corresponding Ubuntu LTS.

As the Mint developers look for ways to reduce the effort they spend on testing and release, perhaps they might consider reducing the number of the non-flagship editions. If only the Cinnamon edition gets new desktops, then perhaps the others could be dropped to more minor releases – even if this means altering the numbering scheme.

Or, alternatively, maybe it&#39;s time to prune the number of different editions. Back in 2018, Linux Mint 19 dropped the KDE desktop, dropping the number of desktops from four to three. Maybe it&#39;s time to do that again. We are loath to suggest it, because we&#39;re very fond of Xfce around the Irish Sea wing of Vulture Towers, but the field of Ubuntu flavours with Xfce is already served exceptionally well.

Obviously, there is the official Xubuntu. It offers a minimal install option with no Snap packages installed, for those averse to Canonical&#39;s cross-distro packaging format. There&#39;s also Linux Lite, which has neither Snap nor Flatpak; we looked at version 7.6 in September 2025, but at the end of last month, Linux Lite 7.8 came out. There&#39;s also Asmi Linux 24.04 which lets the user choose which packaging formats to support.

Another Ubuntu- and Xfce-based alternative distro is on its way out. The other beginner-friendly Ubuntu-based distro to come out of Dublin, Zorin OS, is sunsetting Zorin OS Lite, its Xfce-based variant. One of the reasons is that the full-fat GNOME-based edition runs well – even on low-end computers – now. That applies equally to Linux Mint – and while MATE isn&#39;t quite as light as Xfce, it does run perfectly well on computers lacking full hardware 3D acceleration.

In an ideal world, we&#39;d like to see these separate projects cooperate and maybe share some of the maintenance burden – a distro that combined Mint Xfce with Zorin OS Lite&#39;s themes and Linux Lite&#39;s handy accessory tools could be a very tempting offering – but that seems unlikely to happen. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UK prime minister Keir Starmer has set a &quot;months&quot; timeline for the long-brewing plan for a social media age limit, signaling the government is ready to pick a fight with Big Tech if that&#39;s what it takes.

In a Substack post, Starmer said ministers want powers to set a minimum age for social media far more quickly than it took to grind the Online Safety Act through Parliament, arguing the move is needed to prevent children from being exposed to harmful content and addictive platform design.

The post lands alongside a broader package of measures the government says will be fleshed out through a consultation starting in March as ministers look to expand and tweak the existing online safety framework.

Starmer leaned heavily on the idea that social platforms are distorting children&#39;s development, warning: &quot;Young people&#39;s sense of self depends on this algorithm.&quot;

His post singles out so-called engagement features, such as infinite scroll and auto-play, as examples of functionality that could face restrictions if officials deem them detrimental to children&#39;s well-being, indicating a willingness to push beyond content moderation into the mechanics of how platforms capture attention.

&quot;We will bring new powers that will give us the ability to crack down on the addictive elements of social media, stop the auto-play, the never-ending scrolling, that keeps are [sic] children hooked on their screens for hours, and stop kids getting around age limits,&quot; Starmer wrote.

The UK wouldn&#39;t be alone in targeting infinite feeds. EU regulators are already probing TikTok over whether its limitless scrolling and recommendation algorithms pose systemic risks under the Digital Services Act, a case that could force design changes and set a precedent for others to follow.

Another eyebrow-raising idea is limiting children&#39;s ability to use VPNs to dodge safeguards, a nod to the cat-and-mouse game regulators face whenever age checks or feature restrictions are introduced, but exactly how that would work in practice is anyone&#39;s guess.

The government is also proposing measures that will require tech companies to preserve data on a child&#39;s device if they die – a change championed by campaigners behind so-called Jools&#39; Law – and to bring AI chatbots more explicitly into scope of the online safety regime, reflecting growing concern about how younger users interact with generative tools and the &quot;vile illegal content&quot; created by AI.

This move follows recent scrutiny of Elon Musk&#39;s Grok chatbot after the UK&#39;s privacy watchdog opened a formal investigation into xAI over the bot generating sexual images of real people without consent – a scandal that has intensified calls to tighten rules around AI tools.

Technology secretary Liz Kendall said: &quot;I know that parents across the country want us to act urgently to keep their children safe online. That&#39;s why I stood up to Grok and Elon Musk when they flouted British laws and British values.&quot;

&quot;We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media,&quot; Kendall added. &quot;We are determined to give children the childhood they deserve and to prepare them for the future at time of rapid technological change.&quot;

The tone throughout Starmer&#39;s post is combative, with the PM framing the effort as a willingness to take on Silicon Valley if necessary. &quot;And if that means a fight with the big social media companies, then bring it on,&quot; he said.

However, it&#39;s not just social media platforms that are unlikely to welcome Starmer&#39;s fast-track plans. Digital rights groups have warned that any meaningful under-16 ban quickly runs into the reality of age-gating at scale, which they claim would mean mass age checks across large swathes of the internet.

For now, nothing changes overnight, but by setting a &quot;months&quot; timeline for age limits, floating curbs on addictive features, and widening the rules to cover AI tools, platforms have been put firmly on notice. ®

﻿Sony might push the debut of its next-generation console back to 2029 due to AI memory demands.

Sony and Nintendo are reportedly feeling squeezed by RAM shortages as demand from AI data centers takes up an increasing share of memory chip production. In response to rising costs and dwindling chip supplies, Sony is considering pushing back the release of its next PlayStation console “to 2028 or even 2029,” according to industry sources cited by Bloomberg, while Nintendo may increase the $450 price of its Switch 2 console this year.

That delay would be a considerable divergence from Sony’s usual release schedule, having launched a new console generation every six to seven years since the original PlayStation debuted in 1994. As the current PlayStation 5 console was released in November 2020, it would have been expected to launch before the end of 2027.

The memory shortages are also a blow for Nintendo, which pointedly did not increase the Switch 2 launch price last year despite Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Bloomberg offers no specifics for how much the price might increase. We have reached out to Sony and Nintendo for comment.

﻿Leaker Ice Universe has shared a video of the tech in action.

Samsung has released a new advertisement for its upcoming Galaxy S26 launch that all-but confirms rumors of a new display with a built-in privacy mode. Leaked videos show that the feature could be capable of entirely blacking out content from specific apps or parts of the display when viewed at an angle.

The new advert shows a woman reading a racy romance novel on a subway, while curious passengers look over her shoulder. An overlay shows a quick flick of a “Zero-peeking privacy” toggle, which blacks out the titillating content for the nosy onlookers.

That might sound similar to existing privacy filters, which have been available as after-market screen protectors for years, or found built into products including certain HP laptops. But leaks say what Samsung has in store for the S26 range is different.

It will reportedly use a new type of OLED panel that Samsung Display first debuted two years ago at MWC 2024 called Flex Magic Pixel. It allows viewing angles to be adjusted on a pixel-by-pixel basis, so the privacy effect is only applied to certain parts of the screen at a time. Combined with some AI, that means it could automatically protect sensitive information in a banking app, or be used to hide notifications in a messaging app, as shown in this short video clip shared by the reliable leaker Ice Universe.

We’ll find out more soon enough — Samsung has confirmed that its Unpacked launch event will take place later this month, on February 25th.

﻿Disney and Paramount allege that Seedance 2.0 is distributing and reproducing their intellectual property.

TikTok creator ByteDance says that it is working to improve safeguards on its new AI video generator after Disney, Paramount, and Hollywood trade groups accused the tool of violating copyright protections. Concerns were raised after hyperrealistic videos generated by the Seedance 2.0 model went viral last week, with the likeness of actors, such as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and characters from Dragon Ball Z, Family Guy, and Pokémon.

“ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,” a ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement shared by CNBC. “We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users.”

ByteDance’s response comes after receiving complaints from major studios. In a cease and desist letter sent on Friday, Disney accused ByteDance of “hijacking” its protected characters by “reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works” that feature them. Deadline reports that Paramount Skydance followed with its own cease and desist letter, demanding that ByteDance remove all infringing instances of Paramount content and prevent it from being generated in the future.

Hollywood trade groups have also weighed in, including the Motion Picture Association (MPA) and SAG-AFTRA talent union. MPA CEO Charles Rivkin issued a statement accusing ByteDance of engaging in copyright infringement at a “massive scale,” and disregarding well-established laws that underpin “millions of American jobs.” SAG-AFTRA said that its members’ voices and likenesses have been used by Seedance 2.0 without authorization.

“This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement to AP News. “Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One night in the audience of Netflix’s most ambitious live show yet.

Two hours before one of the most important live events in Netflix’s history, LA’s sprawling CBS Radford Studio Center is abuzz with the strangest combination of things. As I walk through one cavernous soundstage on a Tuesday afternoon, I hear multiple people warming up their voices to sing. I pass a man carefully waving a hair dryer in front of a piano. Outside, a man and a woman, both in scant black leather, walk past with a wave. I’m told they’re aerialists. Somewhere in this enormous rehearsal space, there’s also a 74-year-old budding standup comedian, an 11-year-old gospel singer, and a dancing border collie.

Such is the wondrous, bizarre versatility of Star Search, which on this January evening will start a five-week run of live shows streamed to Netflix’s 300 million-plus subscribers. It’s a reboot of one of TV’s most successful talent shows, though your average Stranger Things fan has likely never heard of it. It also represents one of Netflix’s biggest programming bets ever. The company has spent years building the technical infrastructure to stream all over the world, while also quietly testing show formats and interactive features to see how it might tweak a competition show to make sense in a world overrun by social media.

The company has done huge one-off events, like a boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson; it has done live shows, like Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney. It has hit shows and blockbuster movies, and the ability to turn a decade-old show nobody’s ever heard of into a No. 1 hit. It has wrestling and even some of the NFL. But Netflix has never really tried to do the hardest thing in TV: get its audience to show up, night after night and week after week, to build a simple talent show into an undeniable star-making machine.

When shows like this work, they become cultural events in their own right. Think of American Idol, The Voice, whatever Got Talent you like — all are among the most popular and long-lasting franchises you’ll find anywhere. “There are those formats that are undeniable,” Brandon Riegg, Netflix’s head of unscripted programming, tells me. He sees American Idol as the genre’s true gold standard. “We’ll never see another Idol, in terms of the gap between Idol and the second-place show,” he says, “but we can certainly try to say, ‘What’s the next iteration?’”

The next iteration is about to take place in the next soundstage I enter, which I do cautiously, so as not to run into the enormous pallet filled with every imaginable size and shape of cactus. The Star Search studio is enormous, with bright screens along one wall and a lit-up star at least twice my height casting a golden glow around the room. There are three stages in the room, plus an elevated platform in the center from which the show’s celebrity judges will watch the night’s proceedings. The only hints as to what’s coming tonight: a single chair on one stage, and a tall platform on another that is perfectly suited for falling off to your death in front of millions of people.

With about 90 minutes to air, 450 select audience members are finally allowed to leave the parking garage they’ve been waiting in, and begin to file into the studio. Most don’t know quite what to expect, other than some good celebrity sightings and maybe a chance to be on Netflix themselves. Meanwhile, the team at Netflix is about to find out whether their platform can mint a superstar.

A few minutes after the evening’s audience takes their seats, the event’s emcee, Chuck Dukas, explains how the show works. Most of the audience seems as confused as I am by his explanation, so allow me to try my own: Star Search is America’s Got Talent in content and Jeopardy! in structure. The show features eight categories, from dance to stand-up to music to magic, four of which are shown in a given episode. Each category has a champion, crowned the best of the previous episode, and a challenger, there to knock the champion off the throne. Both contestants do their thing, the judges each give them a score between one and four, and whoever receives the highest average score advances to the next episode to take on a new challenger. Win enough times, and you’re guaranteed a spot in the season finale, where a single grand champion will win $500,000.

Most of the format is borrowed from the original Star Search, which first aired in 1983. It was originally created by Al Masini, a legendary producer who also had a hand in shows from Entertainment Tonight to Baywatch. Masini’s idea was to do an amateur talent show, with carefully chosen acts, presented as glitzily as possible. “We gave them the best lighting available, we gave them the best audio… we put them in a Tiffany setting,” producer Bob Banner said in an interview with the Television Academy years later. “If they didn’t perform well, there’s nothing we could do about it, but we gave them every advantage.”

The show ran until 1995 (not including a reboot nobody really remembers), with Ed McMahon as genial host, and featured an astonishing number of now-household names. Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Usher, and Beyoncé all sang on the show as young kids; Adam Sandler, Dave Chappelle, and Rosie O’Donnell all competed as comedians; Sharon Stone competed as a “spokesmodel,” a category that mercifully no longer exists, in the show’s very first episode.

There is something about the Star Search structure that feels distinctly modern, even four decades after its debut. You can watch a lot of old episodes and clips on YouTube, and it is remarkable just how fast the show moved in those early days. There’s no long windup to each contestant, no heartstring-pulling backstory documentary; there is just a singer and then another singer. An actor and another actor. McMahon slings his arm around the contestant, they get a score, and we’re off to the next one.

Ultimately, that format meant that Star Search had nothing else to offer you but performances. Nearly everyone I spoke to said that casting Star Search was the hardest and most important part of the development process, and that while a show like The Voice or American Idol can survive on the strength of its format and cast alone, Star Search lives and dies a performance at a time. “We’re not booking bad acts to get jokes out of it, you know?” says David Friedman, the show’s co-showrunner. “We’re saying, basically, ‘Look, there’s two acts here, we’re looking for a star. Is there one out here that’s a star?’”

This turns out to have two distinct advantages for Netflix. The first is a more universal appeal: While senses of humor and cultural references may differ across age groups, borders, and demographics, good singing is good singing to pretty much everyone. “And if you don’t like singing,” Friedman says, “wait five minutes. We’ll have a magician for you.”

The second, and maybe more important, is that Star Search functions eerily like a TikTok feed. Look, a dancer! Ooh, magic! Here’s three minutes of stand-up! Time for a cover of your favorite *NSYNC song! Jesse Collins, one of the show’s executive producers, embraces the comparison. “In a way, social media has prepared the world for this,” he says. “You’ll go on TikTok and you’ll fall in love with somebody that does tricks or is a comedian or is a singer or like someone like an IShowSpeed.”

The opportunity for Netflix, Collins says, is to do it bigger and better. To take people out of their parking garages, bedrooms, and passenger seats, and put them back in the “Tiffany setting.” Many of the acts on the show’s first season already have large social followings, some in the millions, which seems to stretch the definition of an amateur talent show. But there may be something still uniquely star-making about Netflix.

Jeff Gaspin, Netflix’s vice president of unscripted series, says he was convinced of all this as soon as he saw the pitch for the show. A group led by the actress Taraji P. Henson had been developing a reboot for a while, and Gaspin immediately thought it might work for Netflix. But he offered a wrinkle: What if the audience could vote? In the original show, the in-studio audience was occasionally called upon to break the judges’ tie scores, but Gaspin thought maybe the audience should operate as effectively a fourth judge, voting in real time from their couches. And he wanted them to be able to vote with their remotes, right on screen, during the broadcast.

Netflix’s product team spent months building a voting system into its apps for mobile devices (where you can vote if you want to), and onto every TV platform and streaming box you can think of. They ran tests with audiences and tested voting in somewhat innocuous places, like a live cooking show hosted by celebrity chef Dave Chang, in which the audience got to rate sandwiches. It all worked, and early testers used it and loved it. So on Star Search, viewers get a pop-up at the end of every performance asking them to rate it from one to five stars, and the average score makes up a quarter of the contestant’s overall rating. Ironically, the only people who don’t get to vote are those of us in the studio audience. We’re under very strict instructions not to use our phones.

Going into the evening, I expected the live voting tools to be on everyone’s minds. If not that, then certainly the uniquely global audience potentially tuning in. But the cast and crew actually seemed more worried about another very Netflix-y thing: This edition of Star Search has no commercial breaks. Commercials, see, are a godsend to the cast and crew. “That’s the time you spend two and a half minutes going, Okay, where are we going next?” Friedman says. “And saying, Oh, the tape’s not ready? Here’s what we’re going to do.” Breaks also give a show its shape, and without them, “there’s no natural ebb and flow anymore,” he says. “It’s just going to have to go.”

Ahead of the first show, Friedman has been chatting with Anthony Anderson, the Black-ish star who is Star Search’s new host. “I’m in his ear, and I’m like, ‘Look, you’re on live TV with no commercials. If something is not working for you, own it,’” Friedman says. “We have passed the point in which you have to hide stuff — viewers like to be brought in on the ride.” Part of making live TV, multiple people told me, is being able to embrace the chaos.

On this Tuesday evening, at least, there is surprisingly little chaos. With about an hour to spare before the 6PM live start, emcee Chuck announces that we’re going to pretape the magic portion of the competition, for reasons no one ever explains. (This eventually causes some conspiracy theories, as viewers of the “live” show notice some clues that they’re seeing old footage.) Both competitors’ tricks go off without a hitch, everyone goes backstage, and Anderson comes back out to practice his intro to the show. Then he’s banished with three and a half minutes to air, and all that’s left to do is wait.

Precisely at the top of the hour, Netflix’s iconic “tudum” sound thunders through the room, Anderson walks out, and the live show commences. Anderson explains to the camera how the show works, has the audience vote on his suit to practice, and kicks off the proceedings. The rest of the show is a blur of singers (Friedman told me just ahead of air that two young kids would be going first, and that yes, he knows it’s kind of cheating to use adorable children to make people like your show), dancers, magicians, and musical groups.

There were, of course, plenty of things to work on. The three celebrity judges — Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jelly Roll, and Chrissy Teigen — were all far too nice to the contestants, even when they gave them bad scores. They also all talked way too much. The sound mixing, particularly on the groups, didn’t always actually mix. At one point, Anderson was visibly confused by the teleprompter, which was instructing him to look in three different places for three different scoring numbers. There were some solid performances, but no obvious stars, and a couple of genuine stinkers. Mostly, the whole thing took too long. This supposedly 60-minute show lasted 90. Still, the voting worked, the stream stayed live, and the whole room seemed to exhale as the confetti fell and the lights turned off.

This was just the first night. There were seven more to do in the next four weeks, plus a grand finale episode on February 17th. Judging from the early reactions, Star Search wasn’t quite a cultural phenomenon yet, but Friedman says he knows even Netflix can’t create a hit all at once. “We do this for five weeks and hopefully it builds, and hopefully the excitement builds, and we get to the end and there’ll be one champion — and hopefully you discover the next somebody.” Everybody studiously avoids jinxing the next season, because Netflix is famous for canceling and forgetting about projects it deems not to be working. But it’s clear the company hopes this was the first night of many in this studio.

Just as we’re all filing out, heading back into a mild LA evening, Dukas the emcee booms back out over the audience telling everyone to take their seats. “Okay!” he says. “We’re going to do the show again in Spanish, and then we’ll get you out of here.”

OpenClaw will live on as an open-source project.

Sam Altman announced on X that Peter Steinberger, the man behind the trendy AI agent OpenClaw, was joining OpenAI. He said that Steinberger has “a lot of amazing ideas” about getting AI agents to interact with each other, saying “the future is going to be extremely multi-agent.” He also said that this ability for agents to work together will “quickly become core to our product offerings.”

OpenClaw, previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot, exploded on the scene earlier this year and became the darling of the tech world. Its rise was swift, but not without its bumps along the way. Earlier this month, researchers found over 400 malicious skills uploaded to ClawHub. It also launched MoltBook, a social network where AI agents went to complain about their humans, debate the provability of consciousness, and discuss the need for a private place to exchange ideas. And then it was immediately infiltrated by humans.

In a post on his personal site, Steinberger said that joining OpenAI would allow him to achieve his goal of bringing AI agents to the masses, without the headaches of running a company. He explained:

I could totally see how OpenClaw could become a huge company. And no, it’s not really exciting for me. I’m a builder at heart. I did the whole creating-a-company game already, poured 13 years of my life into it and learned a lot. What I want is to change the world, not build a large company and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone.

For OpenAI, this is a high-profile hire after several big names were poached by Meta or left to form a rival. It also had a public falling-out with Elon Musk. Details of the deal aren’t public. It’s not clear how much Steinberger is getting paid or what his title might be. But Altman said that OpenClaw will continue as an open-source project in a foundation supported by OpenAI.

It features three of the most unhinged performances in cinema history, and I mean that as a compliment.

Let me just say that I highly recommend you go into Possession blind. Don’t watch a trailer. Don’t even finish reading this. Go watch it now over on Shudder, Criterion, or Metrograph. It’s also available through Kanopy or Hoopla if your library provides access. Then come back so we can talk about it in the comments. Though this probably isn’t one for the squeamish.

Possession is the sort of film that, even if you’ve had the whole plot spoiled for you, can be difficult to follow. After watching it twice, listening to three different podcasts, and reading multiple articles about it, I’m still not 100 percent sure what happened at various points in the movie. I just know I loved it.

You’re dropped immediately into a story about a crumbling marriage set against the backdrop of the Berlin Wall. It’s a formidable metaphor for the division between the stars — a very young and disarmingly handsome Sam Neill (Mark), and Isabelle Adjani (Anna), who turns in one of the most singular and unnerving performances in the history of cinema. Watching Adjani on screen is exhausting — She ricochets between unsettling detachment and high-octane delirium with alarming ease and speed. It’s the sort of performance that, when you hear it basically gave Adjani PTSD, you’re not surprised.

The third standout performance comes from Heinz Bennent, who plays Heinrich, the man Mark believes Anna is leaving him for. He moves through every scene like a drunk ballet dancer, and there’s something almost Wiseau-ian about his delivery. (It certainly doesn’t help that he keeps repeating Mark’s name.) In a more grounded film, the way he careens through the frame would seem absurd. But in the abstract nightmare of Possession, Bennent fits perfectly, rolling around, alternately assaulting Mark and coming on to him.

Director Andrzej Żuławski not only coaxes gorgeously unhinged performances from his stars, he builds live-action paintings. Mark and Ana sit in a cafe at the corner of a bench facing away from each other as they discuss the terms of their separation. (Before Mark tears through the cafe, hurling chairs and tables in a freakout for the ages.) Sam Neill violently pitches a rocking chair back and forth as the focus expertly tracks him. The film is simply gorgeous.

What begins as a bad acid trip about a failing marriage turns into a nausea-inducing body horror in its back half. It’s revealed that Anna isn’t leaving Mark for Heinrich. In fact, Heinrich is just as desperate to get Anna back, to find her and make her his. Instead, she is shacked up with what Anna Bogutskaya (host of The Final Girls podcast and author of Feeding the Monster) calls a “Lovecraftian fuck monster.”

It’s a grotesquerie of tentacles, oozing orifices, and uncanny humanoid features, created by Carlo Rambaldi, who won Academy Awards for special effects on Alien and ET. It feeds on people. Their bodies, but also their souls. Anna seems to think it’s some sort of deity, something holy. She uses it to explore parts of herself she has repressed or lost in her relationship with Mark.

The other men in her life can’t satisfy her, so she creates an ideal lover. What starts as a slimy creature, not unlike the baby from Eraserhead, eventually becomes a doppleganger of Mark.

And then there’s the subway scene. If you’ve ever heard of Possession before, it’s probably because of this scene. Adjani hurls herself around a deserted tunnel, grunting, screaming, convulsing, before oozing blood and god knows all over the wet concrete floor. As a viewer, I feel drained after watching it. It’s three of the most intense minutes ever committed to celluloid, and even if the rest of the film was terrible, Possession would be worth watching just for this scene.

There are so many different readings of this film. I’m still not entirely sure what happens at the end. Did their son Bob drown himself? Is Mark’s doppleganger the antichrist? Is Helen also a doppleganger? (I think so.) What is the deal with Heinrich’s mother? Is Anna possessed? Or is the titular possession about the men in her life trying to exert ownership of her?

In the month since I first watched this movie, I’ve told everyone I know about it. I can’t stop thinking about it or talking about it.

Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.

In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested.Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the accounts was suddenly threatening her. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.

ALS stole this musician’s voice. AI let him sing again.

There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease, it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again. Read the full story.

            <h2>The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132516/cesar-de-la-fuente-using-ai-antibiotics-hunt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was just a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life, César de la Fuente compiled a list of the world’s biggest problems. He ranked them inversely by how much money governments were spending to solve them. Antimicrobial resistance topped the list.

Twenty years on, the problem has not gone away. If anything, it’s gotten worse. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis, published in the Lancet, predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050. In a July 2025 essay in Physical Review Letters, de la Fuente, now a bioengineer and computational biologist, and synthetic biologist James Collins warned of a looming “post­antibiotic” era in which infections from drug-resistant strains of common bacteria like Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which can often still be treated by our current arsenal of medications, become fatal. “The antibiotic discovery pipeline remains perilously thin,” they wrote, “impeded by high development costs, lengthy timelines, and low returns on investment.”

But de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence to bring about a different future. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments.

His quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. In August 2025 his team, which includes 16 scientists in Penn’s Machine Biology Group, described peptides hiding in the genetic code of ancient single-celled organisms called archaea. Before that, they’d excavated a list of candidates from the venom of snakes, wasps, and spiders. And in an ongoing project de la Fuente calls “molecular de-­extinction,” he and his collaborators have been scanning published genetic sequences of extinct species for potentially functional molecules. Those species include hominids like Neanderthals and Denisovans and charismatic megafauna like woolly mammoths, as well as ancient zebras and penguins. In the history of life on Earth, de la Fuente reasons, maybe some organism evolved an antimicrobial defense that could be helpful today. Those long-gone codes have given rise to resurrected compounds with names like ­mammuthusin-2 (from woolly mammoth DNA), mylodonin-2 (from the giant sloth), and hydrodamin-1 (from the ancient sea cow). Over the last few years, this molecular binge has enabled de la Fuente to amass a library of more than a million genetic recipes.

At 40 years old, de la Fuente has also collected a trophy case of awards from the American Society for Microbiology, the American Chemical Society, and other organizations. (In 2019, this magazine named him one of “35 Innovators Under 35” for bringing computational approaches to antibiotic discovery.) He’s widely recognized as a leader in the effort to harness AI for real-world problems. “He’s really helped pioneer that space,” says Collins, who is at MIT. (The two have not collaborated in the laboratory, but Collins has long been at the forefront of using AI for drug discovery, including the search for antibiotics. In 2020, Collins’s team used an AI model to predict a broad-­spectrum antibiotic, halicin, that is now in preclinical development.)

The world of antibiotic development needs as much creativity and innovation as researchers can muster, says Collins. And de la Fuente’s work on peptides has pushed the field forward: “César is marvelously talented, very innovative.”

De la Fuente describes antimicrobial resistance as an “almost impossible” problem, but he sees plenty of room for exploration in the word almost. “I like challenges,” he says, “and I think this is the ultimate challenge.”

The use, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics, he says, drives antimicrobial resistance. And the problem is growing unchecked because conventional ways to find, make, and test the drugs are prohibitively expensive and often lead to dead ends. “A lot of the companies that have attempted to do antibiotic development in the past have ended up folding because there’s no good return on investment at the end of the day,” he says.

Antibiotic discovery has always been a messy, noisy endeavor, driven by serendipity and fraught with uncertainty and misdirection. For decades, researchers have largely relied on brute-force mechanical methods. “Scientists dig into soil, they dig into water,” says de la Fuente. “And then from that complex organic matter they try to extract antimicrobial molecules.”

But molecules can be extraordinarily complex. Researchers have estimated the number of possible organic combinations that could be synthesized at somewhere around 1060. For reference, Earth contains an estimated 1018 grains of sand. “Drug discovery in any domain is a statistics game,” says Jonathan Stokes, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Canada, who has been using generative AI to design potential new antibiotics that can be synthesized in a lab, and who worked with Collins on halicin. “You need enough shots on goal to happen to get one.”

Those have to be good shots, though. And AI seems well suited to improving researchers’ aim. Biology is an information source, de la Fuente explains: “It’s like a bunch of code.” The code of DNA has four letters; proteins and peptides have 20, where each “letter” represents an amino acid. De la Fuente says his work amounts to training AI models to recognize sequences of letters that encode antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs. “If you think about it that way,” he says, “you can devise algorithms to mine the code and identify functional molecules, which can be antimicrobials. Or antimalarials. Or anticancer agents.”

Practically speaking, we’re still not there: These peptides haven’t yet been transformed into usable drugs that help people, and there are plenty of details—dosage, delivery, specific targets—that need to be sorted out, says de la Fuente. But AMPs are appealing because the body already uses them.They’re a critical part of the immune system and often the first line of defense against pathogenic infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have one trick for killing bacteria, AMPs often exhibit a multimodal approach. They may disrupt the cell wall and the genetic material inside as well as a variety of cellular processes. A bacterial pathogen may evolve resistance to a conventional drug’s single mode of action, but maybe not to a multipronged AMP attack.

De la Fuente’s group is one of many pushing the boundaries of using AI for antibiotics. Where he focuses primarily on peptides, Collins works on small-molecule discovery. So does Stokes, at McMaster, whose models identify promising new molecules and predict whether they can be synthesized. “It’s only been a few years since folks have been using AI meaningfully in drug discovery,” says Collins.

Even in that short time the tools have changed, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University, who has worked with Stokes and Collins. Researchers have moved from using predictive models to developing generative approaches. With a predictive approach, Zou says, researchers screen large libraries of candidates that are known to be promising. Generative approaches offer something else: the appeal of designing a new molecule from scratch. Last year, for example, de la Fuente’s team used one generative AI model to design a suite of synthetic peptides and another to assess them. The group tested two of the resulting compounds on mice infected with a drug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, a germ that the World Health Organization has identified as a “critical priority” in research on antimicrobial resistance. Both successfully and safely treated the infection.

But the field is still in the discovery phase. In his current work, de la Fuente is trying to get candidates closer to clinical testing. To that end, his team is developing an ambitious multimodal model called ApexOracle that’s designed to analyze a new pathogen, pinpoint its genetic weaknesses, match it to antimicrobial peptides that might work against it, and then predict how an antibiotic, built from those peptides, would fare in lab tests. It “converges understanding in chemistry, genomics, and language,” he says. It’s preliminary, he adds, but even if it doesn’t work perfectly, it will help steer the next generation of AI models toward the ultimate goal of resisting resistance.

Using AI, he believes, human researchers now have a fighting chance at catching up to the giant threat before them. The technology has already saved decades of human research time. Now he wants it to save lives, too: “This is the world that we live in today, and it’s incredible.”

            <h2>Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132526/allison-nixon-hackers-security-researcher/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.”

It wasn’t long before others piled on. Someone shared AI-generated nudes of Nixon.

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they’d carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren’t just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim’s window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone’s home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison’s and my radar, you’re going [down]. It’s just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you’re done.”

Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says.

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It’s an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement.

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim’s phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com’s impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence.

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There’s only so far that China is willing to go; there’s only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it’s just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com’s roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can’t get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records.

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it’s also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they’re untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I’ve made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn’t suppress her happiness when someone she’s been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company’s counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague’s dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters.

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim’s network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks.

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says.

She wasn’t bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don’t like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I’m willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn’t bother me.”

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them.

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted.

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she’d found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there’s all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn’t figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out.

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim’s phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors’ social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams.

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn’t seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn’t take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon’s skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she’d begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they’d eventually do something significant with that skill.

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker’s career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn’t until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn’t exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it’s an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon’s own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence.

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker’s handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker’s handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member’s name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes’ seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes.

At this point, Waifu still wasn’t on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu’s crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu’s group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account.

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon’s number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they’d stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn’t pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn’t helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn’t the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon’s process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She’d draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target’s enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka’s home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka’s house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu’s online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won’t say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don’t want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he’s alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.”

Prosecutors, who list Moucka’s online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial.

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly.

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu’s group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I’m just going to keep doing that until there’s no one left on that side.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132913/als-stole-this-musicians-voice-ai-sing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I need to say something that might make CS leaders uncomfortable: most of what your team does before a renewal is valuable, but it’s listening to only one channel. Your EBRs, your health scores, your stakeholder maps. They capture what your customer is willing to tell you directly. What they don’t capture is the conversation happening everywhere else. And that’s usually where churn starts.

I know because I ran the standard playbook for years. EBRs, stakeholder mapping, health score reviews, and renewal prep meetings, where we rated our gut feeling on a scale of green to red. We had dashboards. We had strong CSMs who genuinely cared about their accounts. And we still got blindsided.

The $2M quarter is the one I can’t forget. Two enterprise accounts churned in the same 90-day window. Both were green in every system we had. One had an NPS of 72.

When I dug into what happened, I didn’t find a CS execution problem. I found a coverage gap. Every signal had been there. Just not in the places our process was designed to look. I sat in the post-mortem knowing we’d done everything our process asked us to do. That was the problem.

Later in this article, I’ll show you what both of those accounts would have looked like inside Renewal Fix. Before anyone on my team knew there was a problem.

I’m not saying EBRs are useless. A well-run EBR builds relationship depth, gives your champion ammunition internally, and surfaces problems the customer is willing to raise directly. But even the best EBR has a structural limitation: it only captures what someone chooses to say out loud, in a meeting, to a vendor.

The real conversation about your product is happening in a Slack channel you’ll never see, in a procurement review you weren’t invited to, and in a 1:1 between your champion and their new boss who just joined from a company that used your competitor. The EBR gives you one essential channel. The danger is treating it as the only one.

Here’s what was actually happening in those two accounts that churned on me.

Account one: their engineering team had filed 23 support tickets about API latency over four months. Not “the product is broken” tickets. Small, specific, technical complaints that got resolved individually. Nobody in CS ever saw them because they never escalated to “critical.” But lined up chronologically, the pattern was unmistakable: this team was losing patience, one resolved ticket at a time.

Account two: three of their five power users updated their LinkedIn profiles in the same two-week window. One started posting about a competitor’s product. Our champion’s title changed from “Head of” to “Senior Manager.” A quiet demotion nobody noticed because we were watching product usage dashboards, not org charts.

Every CS leader I know has lost an account and later found out the champion left months ago. The customer’s reaction is always the same: “We assumed you knew.” They expect you to track publicly available professional changes, the same information any recruiter monitors. Not tracking them isn’t respectful. It’s a blind spot.

Neither signal lived in our CRM. Neither showed up in our health score. They were sitting in plain sight in systems our CS team had no reason to check.

Health scores aren’t the problem. Treating them as the whole picture is. A typical health score aggregates NPS, login frequency, support ticket count, and feature adoption. Green means safe. Red means act. But these are lagging indicators. By the time login frequency drops, the decision to evaluate alternatives may already be in motion.

When I started tracking leading indicators alongside our existing health model, the difference was striking. Across roughly 300 mid-market accounts over 18 months, we found that support ticket velocity, specifically the rate of increase in non-critical tickets over a rolling 90-day window, predicted churn at T-90 at roughly 2x the accuracy of our composite health score. The signals that actually predict churn aren’t the ones most CS platforms are designed to track.

The teams with the strongest renewal rates don’t abandon their existing processes. They add a signal layer on top. The highest-signal sources break into three tiers.

Tier 1: Support ticket patterns. Not the count, but the velocity, the sentiment trend, and whether the same team keeps filing. A steady trickle of “resolved” tickets from one engineering team is often a louder signal than a single P1 escalation. At scale, this becomes cohort-level complaint clustering across a segment.

Tier 2: People changes. Champion turnover, re-orgs, title changes, and new executives from a competitor’s customer base. The person who bought your product and the person renewing it are often not the same person. At scale, you’re watching for patterns of org instability across your book.

Tier 3: Competitive exposure. Whether your customer is being actively pitched, attending competitor events, or has team members engaging with competitor content online. At scale, you’re tracking which segments your competitors are targeting hardest.

The real challenge isn’t knowing what to track. It’s that these signals live in five or six different systems, and nobody’s job is to stitch them together. Your CSM sees Zendesk. Your SE sees Jira. Your AE sees Salesforce. The full picture only exists if someone manually assembles it.

One team I worked with built a manual version of this: CSMs logging signals from six different sources every Friday. About 90 minutes per account per week. Their renewal rate hit 96%. But the approach doesn’t scale past a 25-account book.

At 80 accounts in a mid-market motion, you need automation. At 150+ in a PLG model, the signals are still there, you’re watching for cohort-level drops in feature adoption or clusters of the same complaint across a segment, but you cannot find them without automation.

The teams doing this manually are logging into six tools every Friday. The teams doing this with automation get a Slack message when something changes. No dashboard to check. No Friday ritual.

Detection without a playbook is just anxiety. The point of catching signals early isn’t to panic. It’s to have time to act. An executive sponsor who hasn’t logged in for 90 days needs a different intervention than an account with a competitor POC in their Salesforce sandbox. The signal tells you what’s happening. The response has to match.

That gap between knowing what to track and actually tracking it consistently is why I built Renewal Fix. Not to replace the manual process, but to remove the ceiling on it. The platform pulls signals from support tickets, call recordings, CRM data, and engineering channels automatically, stitches them into a single account view, and flags them before they become a renewal surprise.

Enter your work email at renewalfix.com. In 30 seconds, you’ll get a one-page executive brief showing your blind spots: 10 accounts that look like they belong in your CS platform, built from your company’s products, competitive landscape, and integration stack, each with a health score and risk signals sourced from support tickets, call recordings, and org changes that your current dashboard would never surface. No demo, no sales call.

Find the account that looks most like Account One. Health score in the 70s, risk signals hiding underneath. Then click “Executive Brief” for a one-page summary of your portfolio’s total risk exposure, with dollar amounts and prioritized actions. That view is what Renewal Fix delivers weekly in production.

Your green accounts aren’t necessarily at risk. But they might be quieter than you realize.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, Peter Steinberger was experimenting with a side project that quickly caught fire across the developer world. His open-source AI assistant, OpenClaw, wasn’t just another chatbot; it could act on your behalf, from managing emails to integrating with calendars and messaging platforms.

Today, that project has a new chapter: Steinberger is joining OpenAI to help build the next generation of personal AI agents.

This move isn’t just about talent acquisition. It marks a switch in how the AI industry thinks about assistants: from reactive systems you talk to, toward agents that take initiative and perform tasks autonomously, with potential implications for productivity, workflows, and personal automation.

OpenClaw first emerged in late 2025 under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot. What distinguished it was not fancy visuals or marketing, but its practical ambition: give users an AI that connects to their tools and executes workflows, booking flights, sorting messages, scheduling meetings, in ways that feel closer to agency than assistant.

It quickly went viral on GitHub, drawing more than 100,000 stars and millions of visits to its project page within weeks.

Rather than turning OpenClaw into a standalone company, Steinberger chose to partner with OpenAI, a decision he explained in a blog post as driven by a simple goal: bring intelligent agents to a broader audience as quickly as possible.

According to him, OpenAI’s infrastructure, research resources, and product ecosystem offered the best path to scale such an ambitious idea.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman welcomed Steinberger’s move as strategic, underscoring that the company expects personal agents, systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and completing tasks across apps, to be an important part of future AI products.

Altman’s public post noted that OpenClaw will continue to exist as an open-source project under a new foundation supported by OpenAI, preserving its accessibility and community roots.

The notion of AI that does things has been bubbling under the surface of tech discourse, but OpenClaw’s popularity crystallised it. Users interact with their agents through familiar interfaces like messaging platforms, but behind the scenes, these agents orchestrate API calls, automate scripts, handle notifications, and adapt to changing schedules, all without explicit commands after initial setup.

This trajectory, from an experimental open-source project to a central piece of a major AI lab’s strategy, speaks to broader trends in the industry. Competitors from Anthropic to Google DeepMind have also indicated interest in multi-agent systems and autonomous workflows, but OpenAI’s move signals how seriously the category is now being taken.

It suggests a future where AI isn’t just conversational, but proactive and tightly integrated into everyday tooling.

At the same time, this evolution raises fresh questions about governance and safety. OpenClaw’s open-source nature meant that developers could experiment freely, but that freedom also exposed potential attack surfaces; misconfigured agents with access to sensitive accounts or automation processes could be exploited if not properly safeguarded.

That is one reason why maintaining an open foundation with careful oversight matters as these tools scale.

For OpenAI, Steinberger’s arrival embeds this agent-first thinking into its product roadmap at a critical moment. The company is already exploring “multi-agent” architectures, where specialised AIs coordinate with each other and with users to handle complex tasks more effectively than monolithic models alone. Steinberger brings an experimental sensibility and real-world experience that could accelerate those efforts.

This could mean future versions of ChatGPT or other OpenAI products will be able to carry out tasks you define, rather than waiting for you to prompt them. That shift, from conversational replies to autonomous action, is the next frontier in how AI will fit into daily digital life.

And with OpenClaw’s creator now inside one of the most influential AI labs in the world, that future feels closer than ever.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.
