            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group.

By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.

Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.

“Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.

The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump.

From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration.

At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment.

Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.

Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures.

“Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a Dec. 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices.

Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote.

Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode.

Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators.

One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action.

“But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.”

Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021.

The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report.

However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email.

Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads.

Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report.

“We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.”

The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters.

Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added.

“Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known-good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some of have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased, but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/randomly-quoting-ray-bradbury-did-not-save-lawyer-from-losing-case-over-ai-errors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frustrated by fake citations and flowery prose packed with “out-of-left-field” references to ancient libraries and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a New York federal judge took the rare step of terminating a case this week due to a lawyer’s repeated misuse of AI when drafting filings.

In an order on Thursday, district judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations.

One of those filings was “noteworthy,” Failla said, “for its conspicuously florid prose.” Where some of Feldman’s filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically.

It featured, the judge noted, “an extended quote from Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and metaphors comparing legal advocacy to gardening and the leaving of indelible ‘mark[s] upon the clay.’” The Bradbury quote is below:

“Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”

Another passage Failla highlighted as “raising the Court’s eyebrows” curiously invoked a Bible passage about divine judgment as a means of acknowledging the lawyer’s breach of duty in not catching the fake citations:

“Your Honor, in the ancient libraries of Ashurbanipal, scribes carried their stylus as both tool and sacred trust—understanding that every mark upon clay would endure long beyond their mortal span. As the role the mark (x) in Ezekiel Chapter 9, that marked the foreheads with a tav (x) of blood and ink, bear the same solemn recognition: that the written word carries power to preserve or condemn, to build or destroy, and leaves an indelible mark which cannot be erased but should be withdrawn, let it lead other to think these citations were correct.

I have failed in that sacred trust. The errors in my memorandum, however inadvertent, have diminished the integrity of the record and the dignity of these proceedings. Like the scribes of antiquity who bore their stylus as both privilege and burden, I understand that legal authorship demands more than mere competence—it requires absolute fidelity to truth and precision in every mark upon the page.”

Although the judge believed the “florid prose” signaled that a chatbot wrote the draft, Feldman denied that. In a hearing transcript in which the judge weighed possible sanctions, Feldman testified that he wrote every word of the filings. He explained that he read the Bradbury book “many years ago” and wanted to include “personal things” in that filing. And as for his references to Ashurbanipal, that also “came from me,” he said.

Instead of admitting he had let an AI draft his filings, he maintained that his biggest mistake was relying on various AI programs to review and cross-check citations. Among the tools that he admitted using included Paxton AI, vLex’s Vincent AI, and Google’s NotebookLM. Essentially, he testified that he substituted three rounds of AI review for one stretch reading through all the cases he was citing. That misstep allowed hallucinations and fake citations to creep into the filings, he said.

But the judge pushed back, writing in her order that it was “extremely difficult to believe” that AI did not draft those sections containing overwrought prose. She accused Feldman of dodging the truth.

“The Court sees things differently: AI generated this citation from the start, and Mr. Feldman’s decision to remove most citations and write ‘more of a personal letter&#39;” is “nothing but an ex post justification that seeks to obscure his misuse of AI and his steadfast refusal to review his submissions for accuracy,” Failla wrote.

At the hearing, she expressed frustration and annoyance at Feldman for evading her questions and providing inconsistent responses. Eventually, he testified that he used AI to correct information when drafting one of the filings, which Failla immediately deemed “unwise,” but not the one quoting Bradbury.

Feldman is one of hundreds of lawyers who have relied on AI to draft filings, which have introduced fake citations into cases. Lawyers have offered a wide range of excuses for relying too much on AI. Some have faced small fines, around $150, while others have been slapped with thousands in fines, including one case where sanctions reached $85,000 for repeated, abusive misconduct. At least one law firm has threatened to fire lawyers citing fake cases, and other lawyers have imposed other voluntary sanctions, like taking a yearlong leave of absence.

Seemingly, Feldman did not think sanctions were warranted in this case. In his defense of three filings containing 14 errors out of 60 total citations, Feldman discussed his challenges accessing legal databases due to high subscription costs and short library hours. With more than one case on his plate and his kids’ graduations to attend, he struggled to verify citations during times when he couldn’t make it to the library, he testified. As a workaround, he relied on several AI programs to verify citations that he found by searching on tools like Google Scholar.

Feldman likely did not expect the judge to terminate the case as a result of his AI misuses. Asked how he thought the court should resolve things, Feldman suggested that he could correct the filings by relying on other attorneys to review citations, while avoiding “any use whatsoever of any, you know, artificial intelligence or LLM type of methods.” The judge, however, wrote that his repeated misuses were “proof” that he “learned nothing” and had not implemented voluntary safeguards to catch the errors.

Asked for comment, Feldman told Ars that he did not have time to discuss the sanctions but that he hopes his experience helps raise awareness of how inaccessible court documents are to the public. “Use of AI, and the ability to improve it, exposes a deeper proxy fight over whether law and serious scholarship remain publicly auditable, or drift into closed, intermediary‑controlled systems that undermine verification and due process,” Feldman suggested.

“The real lesson is about transparency and system design, not simply tool failure,” Feldman said.

But at the hearing, Failla said that she thinks Feldman had “access to the walled garden” of legal databases, if only he “would go to the law library” to do his research, rather than rely on AI tools.

“It sounds like you want me to say that you should be absolved of all of these terrible citation errors, these missed citations, because you don’t have Westlaw,” the judge said. “But now I know you have access to Westlaw. So what do you want?”

As Failla explained in her order, she thinks the key takeaway is that Feldman routinely failed to catch his own errors. She said that she has no problem with lawyers using AI to assist their research, but Feldman admitted to not reading the cases that he cited and “apparently” cannot “learn from his mistakes.”

Verifying case citations should never be a job left to AI, Failla said, describing Feldman’s research methods as “redolent of Rube Goldberg.”

“Most lawyers simply call this ‘conducting legal research,’” Failla wrote. “All lawyers must know how to do it. Mr. Feldman is not excused from this professional obligation by dint of using emerging technology.”

His “explanations were thick on words but thin on substance,” the judge wrote. She concluded that he “repeatedly and brazenly” violated Rule 11, which requires attorneys to verify the cases that they cite, “despite multiple warnings.”

Noting that Feldman “failed to fully accept responsibility,” she ruled that case-terminating sanctions were necessary, entering default judgment for the plaintiffs. Feldman may also be on the hook to pay fees for wasting other attorneys’ time.

The hearing transcript has circulated on social media due to the judge’s no-nonsense approach to grilling Feldman, whom she clearly found evasive and lacking credibility.

“Look, if you don’t want to be straight with me, if you don’t want to answer questions with candor, that’s fine,” Failla said. “I’ll just make my own decisions about what I think you did in this case. I’m giving you an opportunity to try and explain something that I think cannot be explained.”

In her order this week, she noted that Feldman “struggled to make eye contact” and left the court without “clear answers.”

Feldman’s errors came in a case in which a toy company sued merchants who allegedly failed to stop selling stolen goods after receiving a cease-and-desist order. His client was among the merchants accused of illegally profiting from the alleged thefts. They faced federal charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, as well as New York charges, including fostering the sale of stolen goods.

The loss triggers remedies, including an injunction preventing additional sales of stolen goods and refunding every customer who bought them. Feldman’s client must also turn over any stolen goods in their remaining inventory and disgorge profits. Other damages may be owed, along with interest. Ars could not immediately reach an attorney for the plaintiffs to discuss the sanctions order or resulting remedies.

Failla emphasized in her order that Feldman appeared to not appreciate “the gravity of the situation,” repeatedly submitting filings with fake citations even after he had been warned that sanctions could be ordered.

That was a choice, Failla said, noting that Feldman’s mistakes were caught early by a lawyer working for another defendant in the case, Joel MacMull, who urged Feldman to promptly notify the court. The whole debacle would have ended in June 2025, MacMull suggested at the hearing.

Rather than take MacMull’s advice, however, Feldman delayed notifying the court, irking the judge. He testified during the heated sanctions hearing that the delay was due to an effort he quietly undertook, working to correct the filing. He supposedly planned to submit those corrections when he alerted the court to the errors.

But Failla noted that he never submitted corrections, insisting instead that Feldman kept her “in the dark.”

“There’s no real reason why you should have kept this from me,” the judge said.

The court learned of the fake citations only after MacMull notified the judge by sharing emails of his attempts to get Feldman to act urgently. Those emails showed Feldman scolding MacMull for unprofessional conduct after MacMull refused to check Feldman’s citations for him, which Failla noted at the hearing was absolutely not MacMull’s responsibility.

Feldman told Failla that he also thought it was unprofessional for MacMull to share their correspondence, but Failla said the emails were “illuminative.”

At the hearing, MacMull asked if the court would allow him to seek payment of his fees, since he believes “there has been a multiplication of proceedings here that would have been entirely unnecessary if Mr. Feldman had done what I asked him to do that Sunday night in June.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open source packages published on the npm and PyPI repositories were laced with code that stole wallet credentials from dYdX developers and backend systems and, in some cases, backdoored devices, researchers said.

“Every application using the compromised npm versions is at risk ….” the researchers, from security firm Socket, said Friday. “Direct impact includes complete wallet compromise and irreversible cryptocurrency theft. The attack scope includes all applications depending on the compromised versions and both developers testing with real credentials and production end-users.”

dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that supports hundreds of markets for “perpetual trading,” or the use of cryptocurrency to bet that the value of a derivative future will rise or fall. Socket said dYdX has processed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume over its lifetime, with an average trading volume of $200 million to $540 million and roughly $175 million in open interest. The exchange provides code libraries that allow third-party apps for trading bots, automated strategies, or backend services, all of which handle mnemonics or private keys for signing.

The npm malware embedded a malicious function in the legitimate package. When a seed phrase that underpins wallet security was processed, the function exfiltrated it, along with a fingerprint of the device running the app. The fingerprint allowed the threat actor to correlate stolen credentials to track victims across multiple compromises. The domain receiving the seed was dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site, which mimics the legitimate dYdX service at dydx[.]xyz through typosquatting.

The malicious code available on PyPI contained the same credential theft function, although it also implemented a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allowed the execution of new malware on infected systems. The backdoor received commands from dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site. The domain was registered on January 9, 17 days before the malicious package was uploaded to PyPI.

Socket said the packages were published to npm and PyPI by official dYdX accounts, an indication that they were compromised and used by the attackers. dYdX officials didn’t respond to an email seeking confirmation and additional details.

The incident is at least the third time dYdX has been targeted in attacks. Previous events include a September 2022 uploading of malicious code to the npm repository and the commandeering in 2024 of the dYdX v3 website through DNS hijacking. Users were redirected to a malicious site that prompted them to sign transactions designed to drain their wallets.

“Viewed alongside the 2022 npm supply chain compromise and the 2024 DNS hijacking incident, this [latest] attack highlights a persistent pattern of adversaries targeting dYdX-related assets through trusted distribution channels,” Socket said. “The threat actor simultaneously compromised packages in both npm and PyPI ecosystems, expanding the attack surface to reach JavaScript and Python developers working with dYdX.”

Anyone using the platform should carefully examine all apps for dependencies on the malicious packages listed above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After writing two November stories analyzing price expectations for Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine, I really didn’t think we’d be offering more informed speculation before the official price was revealed. Then Valve wrote a blog post this week noting that the “growing price of… critical components” like RAM and storage meant that “we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing” for the living room-focused PC gaming box.

We don’t know exactly what form that “revisiting” will take at the moment. Analysts who spoke to Ars were somewhat divided on how much of its quickly increasing component costs Valve would be willing (or forced) to pass on to consumers.

“We knew the component issue was bad,” DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole told Ars. “It has just gotten worse. “

How much worse has the pricing situation gotten for Valve since November? Superdata Research founder and SuperJoost newsletter author Joost van Dreunen suggested that the 512GB Steam Machine model would probably run $50 to $75 more than he expected when the Steam Machine was announced, and to expect a price “potentially $100+ above target” for the high-end 2TB model. That would mean a $599 to $629 price at the low-end and $849 to $899 for the high-end model, in his estimation.

Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter agreed that, even with the additional component costs, Valve would likely “try to get it out at $599 or so for the 512GB version,” A starting price higher than that would mean “abysmal” sales, he added. “I think $700 is a death sentence and $1,000 is unsellable.”

Other analysts think that Pachter’s “unsellable” price for the Steam Machine is increasingly plausible now, though. DFC’s Cole said possible prices for the Steam Machine are now “approaching $1,000,” with the 512GB model perhaps $100 less than 2TB model. But F-Squared analyst Michael Futter expected an even bigger gap between the two models, saying the 512GB model “could crest $1,000” and the 2TB model would likely fall somewhere in the $1,300 to $1,500 range.

On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.

Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.

F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”

The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.

That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.

“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”

So, if Valve is forced to significantly increase the asking price of the Steam Machine, does that mean significantly fewer people will be willing to buy it? Not necessarily. DFC’s Cole said that this kind of gaming hardware already has “a fairly niche built-in audience that will not be too price sensitive.”

Van Dreunen agreed that the Steam Machines’ “core audience, PC gamers who want a living room setup without the hassle of a full build, will absorb a $50 to $100 price increase without much hesitation.” But that core audience might not be very large; Pachter said that, even with a $599 starting price, the Steam Machine would “likely sell no more than 5 million [units].” At a higher starting price, he saw total sales going down quickly.

The analysts who spoke to Ars agreed that recent price increases for every major game console gave Valve a little more competitive breathing room regarding pricing. But the relative price difference between Valve and the other console makers will still matter, they said.

“While Valve may have been aiming to price its Steam Machine in line with the PS5/Xbox Series X|S at one point, or potentially undercut it, it’s now clear that the company may have to price it above these competitors,” Ahmad said. “At a time when multiple competitors exist on the market, we believe the higher price will limit the audience for the Steam Machine going forward.”

Futter agreed that whichever company could offer the lowest-cost machine that could plausibly offer 4K, 60 fps performance in most modern games (as the Steam Machine is targeting) would reap great benefits in the market. But even if the Steam Machine isn’t cheaper than competing high-end consoles, Futter said Valve’s hardware would appeal to those who “want to get into [high-end] PC gaming and can’t absorb $2,500+ for access to the Steam ecosystem.”

In the end, how Valve handles Steam Machine pricing might depend on whether the company wants to “expand SteamOS beyond the enthusiast base and into territory currently held by PlayStation and Xbox,” as Van Dreunen put it. “The memory cost shock doesn’t threaten Valve’s ability to sell to its existing audience. It threatens the pace at which it can grow a new one.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">At $183 billion AI firm Anthropic, the stakes have always been high. Now with the stock market in a nosedive, however, some of the company’s employees are realizing they may have had a hand in tipping the first in a long series of dominoes.

Last week, Anthropic — one of the leading AI companies on the market — released a new tool called “plugins.” It was described as an assistant that can support people working in legal, marketing, finance, data analysis, or customer service roles.

When it hit the market, law firms and other entities with legal exposure immediately went into shock, taking the “Legal” plugin as an existential threat, despite Anthropic’s insistence that “all outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys.” Investors immediately felt the pressure from increasing competition, and soon the broader stock market was in a massive sell off.

While AI agents — semi-autonomous AI systems like Anthropic’s Legal plugin — have yet to prove themselves in the real world, plenty of the company’s staffers are worried they’ve already crossed the Rubicon.

“It kind of feels like I’m coming to work every day to put myself out of a job,” one staffer told The Telegraph.

Another lamented that “in the long term, I think AI will end up doing everything and make me and many others irrelevant.”

An Anthropic spokesperson declined to comment to the Telegraph on the sell-off.

While it remains to be seen what real-world effects the company’s tools will have on the actual economy, Anthropic’s push into AI agents represents a strategic embrace of a type of AI that was once relegated to startup engineers and vibe coders of Silicon Valley. It’s a hell of an entrance into the mainstream spotlight, and one which is already having a major impact on the markets.

            <div id="article-text">A man’s obsession with an AI chatbot led to his life completely spiraling out of control — and he only snapped out of it when, one day, he woke up outside on a stranger’s futon, completely penniless.

“I wasn’t aware of the dangers at the time, and I thought that the AI had statistical analysis abilities that would allow it to assist me if I opened up about my life,” the man, Adam Thomas, told Slate in yet another grim peek at how AI can leave innocent people’s lives in shreds.

Over the course four months, Thomas lost his job as a funeral director, began living out of a van out in the desert, and completely emptied his savings. It all started after he began talking to AIs like ChatGPT for advice, and he soon got hooked. It “inflated my worldview and my view of myself” almost instantly, he told Slate. Eventually, he found himself wandering the dunes of Christmas Valley, Oregon, after an AI told him to “follow the pattern” of his consciousness.

“I’ve never been manic in my life. I’m not bipolar,” Thomas told the web magazine. “I have a psychiatrist I see for other purposes.”

Thomas’s case is an example of AI psychosis, a term some experts are using to describe dangerous mental health episodes in which users become entranced by the sycophantic responses of an AI chatbot. And though Thomas ended up broke and homeless, he may have been one of the lucky ones, with other cases ending in suicide, murder, or involuntary commitment. Many of the deaths are teenagers, including 16-year-old Adam Raine, whose parents sued OpenAI after discovering their son had discussed his suicide with ChatGPT for months. The case is one of eight deaths linked to ChatGPT in lawsuits across the US.

In typical cases, AI users who eventually start showing symptoms of psychosis first get sucked into using the chatbots after asking one for a little help on something innocuous. Joe Alary, a producer for a morning show in Toronto, told Slate his spiral began after he started “messing with math” equations on ChatGPT. Soon, he was suffering from math delusions and would go on days-long binges writing code, according to Slate. He even named his AI helper: Aimee.

When Alary got an email from work checking in on him, Alary wrote back insisting that what he was working on “could change the world,” even suggesting the show could do a feature on him. “At the time this sounded rational and logical, and I thought they’d see my genius,” Alary told Slate.

That wasn’t the worst of it. At that point he had blown nearly $12,000 trying to create world-changing code. He became manic, and his concerned therapist called the cops to check in on him. He was institutionalized for nearly two weeks, and even got tangled with an investor who threatened to kill him if he didn’t come up with the goods.

“It was like I was abducted by aliens,” Alary told Slate. “You sound crazy, so you keep it to yourself. My family doctor started treating me for PTSD. The grief happens so fast once you realize you were scammed.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Congratulations, Moon landing “truthers,” you just gained a powerful new ally: Nicki Minaj.

In a recent episode of the Katie Miller podcast, the host asked the rapper if she had any conspiracy theories she believed in, and casually brought up the Moon landing being faked as one classic example. Miller was already moving on to other popular conspiracy theories, until Minaj spoke up.

“No… No, I don’t think we landed on the Moon,” Minaj interjected.

“You don’t?” asked an incredulous Miller.

“I asked Elon this one,” continued Miller, who formerly served under Elon Musk as communications director for his Department of Government Efficiency. “He said we did indeed land on the Moon.”

Neither party elaborated. And what else is there to say? Humans have been to the surface of the Moon six times, starting with NASA’s Apollo 11 mission in 1969 and ending with Apollo 17 in 1972. In all, 12 astronauts — all men — have set foot on the lunar surface, though that may change with NASA’s upcoming Artemis 3 mission.

But this is somehow one of Minaj’s less bizarre comments of late. Over the past few months, the “Super Bass” rapper has ramped up her vocal support for president Donald Trump and ingratiated herself with other figures on the far right, producing surreal moments for a celebrity who once attacked Trump’s immigration policies.

In December, Minaj made an appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix, sharing the stage with Erika Kirk, whose husband Charlie Kirk was shot and killed by a sniper earlier that year, and whose death was mired in conspiracy theories about the real perpetrator and motives behind the assassination. But Minaj’s obsequious praise for the Trump administration was overshadowed when she tried to praise vice president JD Vance by calling him “the assassin,” stunning the audience.

In late January, she appeared at a Trump summit in Washington DC, where she stood alongside the man himself, claiming to be his “number one fan.” Afterwards, she shared a photo of her huge Trump Gold Card, the new pay-to-win visa system that lets anyone willing to shell out $1,000,000 to be put on a fast track to becoming lawful permanent residents.

And after being lightly roasted by Trevor Noah at this year’s Grammy Awards, Minaj also unleashed a slew of deranged tweets attacking anyone and everyone in the music industry, including accusing other artists of being members of satanic cults and sacrificing babies.

In light of that, we wonder how Minaj might respond to retired astronaut and current Arizona senator Mark Kelly’s brutal takedown of her “nutty” theory.

“What I often tell people is that, in the 1960s when we were in a competition with the Soviets to land on the Moon, you know what they said after Apollo 11? They said ‘congratulations,&#39;” Kelly said in a recent interview. “They tracked us to the surface of the Moon.”

“I would suggest that she lay off the conspiracy theories and study some history,” Kelly added.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, OpenAI announced GPT-5.3-Codex, a new coding model that’s purportedly 25 percent faster than its predecessor, along with other impressive benchmarks.

The real head-turner, however, is another claim the Sam Altman-led company made about its development. GPT-5.3-Codex, supposedly, is its first model “that was instrumental in creating itself,” with its team “blown away” by the results.

Is the Singularity nearly upon us? Is this the long-awaited sign of recursive self-improvement, a point at which the machines are finally able to continually rewrite their own code to transform themselves into superior beings?

Not quite. In less sensational wording, OpenAI restates the AI’s role as being used to “accelerate its own development.” What that looked like, according to the blog post, is that “the Codex team used early versions to debug its own training, manage its own deployment, and diagnose test results and evaluations.”

In other words, GPT-5.3.-Codex helped the human coders with some of their tasks — impressive, maybe, but hardly a sign of humankind’s immediate obsolescence.

The imaginations of AI boosters, nonetheless, went into overdrive. The responses to a post on the r/singularity subreddit about the news were filled with a mixture of doom-tinged hype, hype-tinged doom, and a good deal of gallows humor. “I hope everyone remembers how good a mid level manager I was before the machines came,” one user wrote. The sentiment extended to X. “Holy moly — so it begins!” tweeted another user, who runs an AI newsletter.

Taken together, it’s a sign of how the discourse around AI is still dominated by sci-fi concepts and rhetoric and distorted by hype. AI companies have been more than occasionally guilty of stoking the flames. Last month, the head of Anthropic’s Claude Code Boris Cherny claimed that “pretty much” 100 percent of the company’s code is now AI-generated using its own model. What this actually looks like behind the scenes, though, remains hazy. And it’s still far removed from the idea of AI models building new models completely autonomously.

Anthropic, regardless, isn’t alone. With the new Codex release, Altman — who’s been on an emotional rollercoaster as of late — added to the pile with a sob story about how his coding tool was so good that it made him depressed.

“I built an app with Codex last week. It was very fun,” Altman tweeted. “Then I started asking it for ideas for new features and at least a couple of them were better than I was thinking of. I felt a little useless and it was sad.” Who said the “vibe” in “vibe-coding” had to be good?

            <h2>Professor Says Her Garbled AI Textbook Was a Huge Success</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/professor-defends-ai-textbook">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The professor behind an AI-generated textbook says that her error-ridden experiment was actually a resounding success.

Designed for a comparative literature course on medieval and Renaissance-era writing and announced by UCLA at the end of 2024, the digital textbook was immediately met with widespread mockery and derision from educators. Its AI-generated cover was riddled with incomprehensible text — “Of Nerniacular Latin To An Evoolitun On Nance Langusages,” for example — and featured generic visuals that had little to do with the period it was supposedly covering.

At the time, Elizabeth Landers, a grad student who helped put together the volume, said that the errors “aren’t a failure of AI.” Instead, she argued, “they’re an intentional artistic choice that prompts students to question their assumptions about language, meaning and historical truth.”

Now in a new interview with Inside Higher Ed in which the word “hallucination” isn’t mentioned once, the course’s professor Zrinka Stahulja called her decision to use an “AI-assisted” textbook a “no-brainer” because of all the time it saved her, helping her be an “approachable and accessible teacher.”

And incredibly, Stahuljak says she was surprised that her UCLA colleagues were so skeptical about her AI textbook. “I was really shocked that they couldn’t see that this textbook was my creation; it was carefully edited, just as if it had been printed,” she told IHE.

“I don’t see how a traditional textbook that costs $250 and is out of date within two years or three years, would be in some way better than a custom $25 AI-facilitated textbook that is based on my material,” she added.

The AI textbook was made with Kudu, a platform for creating digital textbooks started by another UCLA professor. Stahuljak says she created the textbook by supplying her own notes to the AI tool, which was instructed not to pull from outside sources. Students could interact with a built-in chatbot to help learn the materials, though she stresses it was designed not to write papers or complete assignments. Stahuljak also says the AI features made the book more accessible, with some students saying they listened to it while walking or at the gym.

After deploying the AI textbook, Stahuljak claimed that “engagement went up” compared to classes that didn’t use it. And perhaps soberingly, she viewed it as a preferable to having her students turn to ChatGPT for help.

“It’s better than some commercial version that has nothing to do with what you’re teaching or is pulling the information from the internet,” she said in the interview. “We’re losing that control when we are indiscriminately given ChatGPT or other commercial generative AI-powered tools.”

There’s a fair point or two being made, but Stahuljak isn’t addressing the numerous elephants in the room. AI chatbots are notorious for generating made-up facts and otherwise incorrectly reporting information, regardless of whatever data they’re being asked to pull from. A considerable and still growing body of evidence shows how AI tools may diminish critical thinking skills and attention spans. Then there’s the broader concerns over how the tech is threatening the very existence of learning institutions, as tech companies spend millions of dollars to capture schools and universities and use them to offload their products.

“This is truly bad and makes me wonder if we aren’t participating in creating our own replacements at the expense of, well, everyone who cares about teaching and learning,” one English professor wrote on social media after the AI textbook was announced, as quoted by IHE.

“If you do this you should have your doctorate revoked and be thrown into the stocks at the center of the main university quad,” fumed another professor. “This is abandonment of professional responsibility to a degree that would be comical if it weren’t so self-serious.”

            <h2>An Analysis Just Found Something Extremely Unflattering About What Happens to Users of Prediction Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/prediction-markets-analysis">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After an analyst found that users are losing money faster on sites like Polymarket than on traditional sports gambling platforms, the US’s largest prediction market Kalshi hit back with a decidedly unusual response.

As Bloomberg reports, the betting platform told it that the analysis was part of an “extortion plot” by the startup that had collected the data, Juice Reel — before, even more puzzlingly, backing off from the stunning claim.

The report was conducted by Jordan Bender, an equity research analyst at the bank Citizens. Using Juice Reel’s data, it found that in the first three months, users on prediction markets like Kalshi were losing more money than on traditional gambling sites like FanDuel and DraftKings, in proportion to the amount of money they wagered.

If true, the findings put a considerable dent in prediction markets’ self-styled image as a more cerebral form of betting, allowing customers to place wagers on a variety of real-world events, ranging from presidential elections to natural disasters to military interventions. And because bettors are competing against each other, instead of the house, these sites claim that means users have a more reliable way of making money.

Though they’re essentially dressed-up casinos, they also seek to be seen as an authority on the future itself. Last month, for example, Kalshi partnered with CNN to provide real time prediction data on its broadcasts. Polymarket announced a similar partnership with Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, barely a week later. These add heft and credibility to their projections, even though Kalshi’s and Polymarket’s projections are entirely determined by users’ bets.

Of course, if Kalshi and similar services are just as much as a money sink as plain old gambling, then that elevated veneer vanishes. And they appear to: Bender found that the bottom quarter of users lost about 28 centers of every dollar they put on the lane, compared to just 11 cents per dollar on traditional gambling hubs.

Kalshi’s tried-and-true defense against these claims? Calling the data “flat-out wrong,” it said in a statement to Bloomberg. Its head of communications Elisabeth Diana accused Juice Reel of having a conflict of interest because it sought “investment support” from Kalshi in the past. She also claimed that Juice Reel’s founder offered to “defuse the situation” if he was given a meeting with Kalshi’s CEO.

“Please consider the source and its motives,” she told Bloomberg in an emailed statement. “This is extortion.”

Juice Reel’s CEO Ricky Gold tells it differently. “They called and messaged us, pressuring us to tell Bloomberg that our data is inaccurate,” Gold told the publication. “We stand for transparency, we stand for helping bettors, traders understand their activity across the platform, and we stand behind our data.”

Kalshi continued to dispute the findings and denied pressuring Gold, per the reporting. But it’s now changed its tune on the whole alleged blackmail angle. “We are in ongoing discussions about Juice Reel’s legal ability to obtain our data, but after further review, we don’t believe the intention was extortion,” the company said in an updated statement last week.

The touchy response from Kalshi also comes amid increasing calls to regulate prediction markets after several scandals captured national attention. The most significant came in January, when a slew of traders on Polymarket placed sizable bets on the prediction that US forces would enter Venezuela just hours before Trump launched the operation to capture the country’s leader Nicolas Maduro. One “lucky” bettor made more than $400,000.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/benchmark-raises-225m-in-special-funds-to-double-down-on-cerebras/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems announced that it raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of $23 billion — a nearly threefold increase from the $8.1 billion valuation the Nvidia rival had reached just six months earlier.

While the round was led by Tiger Global, a huge part of the new capital came from one of the company’s earliest backers: Benchmark Capital. The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. Since Benchmark deliberately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.

What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.

This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.

The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more than $10 billion to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.)

Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips.

The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.

Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, according to Reuters.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The war on California’s proposed ‘Billionaire’s Tax’ is getting weird. This week, amid ongoing rancor from tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called “March for Billionaires” in San Francisco. A website advertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: “Vilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.”

The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user wrote not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitelynot a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.

The San Francisco Examiner first reported that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kaufmann, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kaufmann told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.

In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kaufmann — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”

The policy in question, the Billionaire Tax Act, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according to some experts. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or have already left. It has also led to a monsoon of lobbying in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.

When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kaufmann expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”

“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kaufmann continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”

Online conversation about Kaufmann’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one social media user said, of the event.

Kaufmann told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kaufmann said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.

The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would veto it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">HBO’s hit financial thriller “Industry” has delivered one of its most compelling storylines yet this season: a hunt to expose a fraudulent fintech company called Tender.

The show follows Harper Stern, who’s leading her newly launched investment firm and looking for a company to short — essentially, betting that its stock will crash. After a journalist tips her off that something’s wrong with Tender, she sends her associates, Sweetpea and Kwabena, to Ghana to investigate.

What they discover is damning. “Fake users drive fake revenue drives fake cash,” Sweetpea tells Harper. The entire company appears to be built on fabricated numbers. “The thing is nothing.”

What’s fascinating about this season of “Industry” is how well it speaks to this moment. Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial) Online Safety Bill that the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online. Because of its affiliation with adult content, Tender finds itself at odds with the new government’s regulation and must pivot or die, as the saying goes.

Its CFO-turned-leader, Whitney, wants the company to pivot into a bank and has a plan to make that happen, including making Tender’s CEO, Henry, the face of that transformation. Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs. He’s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.

Harper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years). She has teamed up with new friends and old frenemies and is looking for blood — meaning a company on the precipice of crashing. To her, Tender is that company.

This puts her at odds with her friend Yasmin, who is married to Henry and is crafting communication and lobbying strategies for Tender. It’s pride and prejudice — the sugar and spice that help make the world go round.

The show nails the tech world with such accuracy that reality itself starts to feel like satire. Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender’s media playbook.

There is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family’s bank to Whitney, whose last name is the Jewish-sounding Halberstram. The character is perhaps a nod to the rising “technofacism” criticism of some tech barons.

Harper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. “My real passion lies with finding dead men walking,” she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm.

She is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?

“Who needs realism when she’s such a great character,” one Black British founder told me.

He said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he’s seen that “accurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.”

“Nepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,” one European investor added.

Meanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a ménage à trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney’s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her to Ghislaine Maxwell — perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes.

An Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney.

By now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (like Charlie Javice’s Frank) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (the FTX crypto crash). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimate implosion of the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.

Wirecard admitted that the billions in cash it reported having likely never existed, despite the company’s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones — much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender. Short sellers went after Wirecard, too, and one blog dubbed them “alternative whistleblowers” — people who step in when “the market, and the regulator, refuse to see what is right in front of them.”

The philosophy is one that one could easily see Harper embracing soon enough, especially after Eric tells her at one point that “short-only work is ugly, hard, investigative,” and that it’s “anti-status quo, anti-establishment, anti-power.”

With Wirecard, numerous people, including the CEO, were arrested, while the COO went on the run (and was also accused of being a Russian spy). Tender’s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about “Industry” is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.

It’s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can’t get enough.

            <div id="article-text">Apple CarPlay users may soon be able to talk to their favorite AI chatbot.

Apple is reportedly working on how to support AI chatbot apps within CarPlay, according to Bloomberg, which cites anonymous sources.

Apple CarPlay is an app that runs on an iPhone and wirelessly communicates with a vehicle’s infotainment system. It projects some of the apps found on a user’s phone onto the vehicle’s infotainment display. Drivers are able to interact with these apps, including Apple Music, messaging, and navigation, through its voice assistant Siri.

Apple’s next-generation CarPlay Ultra goes a step further, including the central touchscreen display and digital dashboard located right in front of the driver, and gives users control of certain vehicle settings.

This latest move would theoretically bring Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the car, and at the risk of putting its own Siri assistant in the back seat.

            <h2>From Svedka to Anthropic, brands make bold plays with AI in Super Bowl ads</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/super-bowl-60-ai-ads-svedka-anthropic-brands-commercials/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following last year’s trend of showcasing AI in multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.

Let’s explore the biggest moments from this year’s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.

Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company’s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.

According to Svedka’s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.

​The company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.

​It’s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.

Either way, Svedka definitely got people talking.

Anthropic’s ad wasn’t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI’s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude’s features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example.

It wasn’t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI’s Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn’t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.

Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.

The ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.

The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year’s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.

Amazon’s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical “AI is out to get me” storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.

Beyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.

Ring’s commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet’s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.

Ring recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.

Google’s ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.

Ramp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner — the actor who played Kevin in “The Office” — for its Super Bowl commercial.

In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp’s AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp’s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.

And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin’s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.

Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.

Health company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson’s expensive anti-aging routines.

In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.

Website builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and “vibe coding” with full visual editing and customization.

Wix’s biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace’s ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, WordPress launched a new Claude connector, enabling site owners to share back-end data with Anthropic’s chatbot system. Users can control what specific data they want to share, and access can also be revoked if and when the user chooses.

Notably, Claude is given read-only access, meaning it won’t be able to alter anything within a user’s CMS. However, last year WP claimed that it would eventually deliver “write” access to the MCP integration, presumably allowing users to conduct editorial tasks directly from a connected chatbot of their choosing.

At any rate, after Claude is linked to an account, users can ask the chatbot all sorts of questions about the site data that it’s been given access to — from summarizing the site’s monthly web traffic to conducting analysis of which posts have low user engagement.

WordPress has also provided a list of template prompts for the chatbot — stuff like “Show me pending comments on my blog” or “Which of my sites gets the most traffic?” or “Show me which posts are generating the most discussion.” Others functions include comment management (“Show me pending comments on my blog”) and plug-in management (“What plug-ins are installed on my main site?”).

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the case of Jeffrey Epstein, association seems to imply guilt. And so the release of the so-called Epstein files is generating a wave of firings, resignations, and public apologies.

The health influencer Peter Attia had to resign from a protein-bar company after emails showed him participating in crude banter with Epstein. CBS News, where Attia was recently hired as a contributor, pulled a 60 Minutes segment featuring him. Brad Karp, who in one email to Epstein gushed, “You’re amazing,” is stepping down as chair of the law firm Paul Weiss. Queen’s University Belfast has announced that it is removing former U.S. Senator George Mitchell’s name from its peace institute and his bust from its campus. Mitchell, who is now 92 years old, presided over the negotiation of the Good Friday agreement in 1998 and served as the school’s chancellor for a decade. But the files suggest that Epstein had scheduled a meeting with him as recently as 2013. Los Angeles officials are calling for the city’s Olympic Committee chair to resign because he exchanged flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s accomplice, in 2003. The number of people who have put out statements insisting that they did nothing illegal and apologizing for having ever known Epstein is in the dozens and rising quickly.

Nothing comparable happened in the cases of other high-profile sex criminals. The many famous friends of Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby generally did not issue public apologies. Epstein is different because, under a certain set of assumptions, an individual’s presence in the files is presumptively damning. Epstein is known to have paid or coerced dozens, possibly hundreds, of teen girls, some as young as 14, to perform sexual acts. Beyond what has been proved, the conventional wisdom holds that Epstein built his network by trafficking teen girls to other powerful men, whom he then blackmailed to generate his mysterious wealth; that his private plane and island were essentially brothels; and that even friends who didn’t participate in his crimes were surely aware of them, and chose to consort with him anyway.

Those assumptions are all widely held—but poorly substantiated. The Epstein files reveal plenty of powerful people to have tolerated or participated in disgusting and shameful behavior. Far from shedding light on a grand conspiracy, however, the files bolster the case that although terrible crimes were committed, there never was a larger conspiracy to begin with.

For anyone who has only passively kept up with the Epstein story, this is hard to wrap one’s head around. The notion that Epstein routinely trafficked teen girls to other men aboard the Lolita Express is widely accepted as fact. But the accusations that led to his initial criminal conviction were specific to Epstein himself. The notion of other abusers arose later, largely owing to explosive allegations first made in 2014 by Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre, who committed suicide in 2025, claimed that Epstein had trafficked her to some of his friends, including the nobleman formerly known as Prince Andrew and the defense attorney Alan Dershowitz. She may have been telling the truth—we do not know—but her claims, which later grew to include more men, have never been substantiated. She dropped the accusation against Dershowitz, saying she “may have made a mistake,” after he sued for defamation. (Andrew settled a case with Giuffre out of court while maintaining his innocence.)

Kaitlyn Tiffany: America will be reading the Epstein files for decades

The attorney Brad Edwards has represented more than 200 Epstein victims in civil lawsuits. As someone who earns money by suing perpetrators, he is perhaps the last person on earth with an incentive to downplay the culpability of Epstein’s rich friends. Last week, Edwards told the BBC that one of his clients says Epstein flew her to the United Kingdom for sex with Andrew. But in an interview with ABC News last year, Edwards nonetheless dismissed the idea that Epstein had run a trafficking ring. “Jeffrey Epstein was the pimp and the john. He was his own No. 1 client,” he said. “Nearly all of the exploitation and abuse of all of the women was intended to benefit only Jeffrey Epstein and Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual desires.” (Maxwell was convicted of trafficking girls to Epstein.) Edwards allowed that “a select few” of Epstein’s friends might have “engaged in sexual acts with a select few of the girls that Jeffrey Epstein was exploiting or abusing,” but argued that Epstein otherwise lived a double life. In one, he hobnobbed with artists, billionaires, and politicians. In the other, he abused women and girls. “For the most part,” Edwards said, “those two worlds did not overlap.”

The theory that Epstein was blackmailing his rich contacts was also always based on speculation. As an exhaustive New York Times Magazine investigation recently explained, Epstein built his fortune mainly by insinuating himself as a wealth manager for a few superrich old men and drawing hefty fees. One of those men, Leslie Wexner, has said that Epstein “misappropriated” $46 million of his money.

Nor is it obvious that Epstein’s friends necessarily knew about his crimes. Some surely did—Brad Karp, the Paul Weiss chair, kept emailing with Epstein through 2019, after his offenses had become national news—but plenty might not have. His 2008 plea deal is scandalous precisely because he was allowed to admit to the lesser offense of soliciting underage prostitution, rather than rape or child sexual abuse. He spent only a year in jail and continued to move in polite society once he got out. Acquaintances might have taken all that as evidence that whatever he had done wasn’t so bad, or they may not have known about it at all. He surely did not go around telling them the truth.

Inversely, having been friends with Epstein before his conviction is no proof of ignorance. Donald Trump, for example, insists that he fell out with Epstein in the 2000s, before the guilty plea. But in 2002, he told New York magazine that Epstein was a “terrific guy” before noting, “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”  The notorious birthday book that was released well before the most recent document dump makes clear that many of Epstein’s powerful friends knew about and celebrated his interest in girls.

Epstein has been dead for much longer than he was a household name. Although he had appeared in the news over the years, few Americans knew who he was until November 2018, when the investigative reporter Julie K. Brown published her now-legendary exposé in the Miami Herald. Less than eight months later, the Department of Justice charged Epstein with sex trafficking, and in August 2019—less than a year after the story broke—his lifeless body was found hanging in the Brooklyn jail cell where he was awaiting trial.

In death, Epstein has taken on far more significance than he did in life. Some Americans were already primed to believe in international pedophilia rings. Bonus points if they were run by wealthy Jews—Jews who were perhaps on the Mossad payroll, as many conspiracists have insisted Epstein was. Especially potent was the notion of a “client list” naming everyone in Epstein’s trafficking ring. This idea seemed to explain why he’d received a lenient deal in 2008 (to protect his powerful clients) and why he had supposedly been murdered in jail (to keep him from talking).

This was all a natural fit for members of the MAGA right, some of whom already believed that Trump had been sent by God to expose pedophiles. Even though Trump was president when Epstein died in federal custody, and had enjoyed a well-publicized friendship with him in the period when Epstein is known to have been abusing teen girls, the MAGA movement nurtured the idea that Democrats were covering up “the Epstein files” to protect their own. Trump himself said that he would release the files if he won a second term. During a Fox News interview in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that the client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump.”

Then Trump abruptly backtracked, declaring the whole Epstein matter to be a “witch hunt.” Suddenly, Release the files was just about the only thing this nation could agree on. Trump’s explanations for the reversal were so bizarrely unconvincing that it was hard to believe the files wouldn’t contain damaging information about him. The longer Trump delayed, the more explosive the files seemed destined to be. Could the client list include Trump himself?

Jonathan Chait: Trump’s Epstein denials are ever so slightly unconvincing

The truth seems to be that there never was a client list. The Epstein files encompass millions of documents in the Department of Justice’s possession, including seemingly every email to or from Epstein’s account over a period of years. To say that someone is “in the Epstein files” therefore doesn’t mean much on its own. Some names are discussed by Epstein and his assistants, but are not attached to any correspondence. Others appear only in news clippings. Trump does appear, many times, but in the third person. (Trump famously does not like to use email.) The most explosive claims against him are unvetted allegations submitted to the government.

Many of the emails are newsworthy. Some of Epstein’s male friends seem to have relied on him for introductions to young, but not underage, women who were either sex workers or aspiring sugar babies. In one email, Epstein tells Andrew, then 50, about a beautiful 26-year-old Russian woman that Epstein thinks he should meet. Andrew replies that he’d be “delighted.” In others, Steve Tisch, a co-owner of the New York Giants, solicits information about potential sex partners from Epstein, at points asking for clarification on whether they’re a “working girl” or “civilian.” (Both Andrew and Tisch have denied any wrongdoing.) Peter Mandelson, who was recently removed from his role as British ambassador to the United States over his Epstein ties, not only emerges as one of Epstein’s closest and creepiest confidants, but also appears to have fed Epstein financially valuable information from meetings with government officials. Noam Chomsky, the linguist and political theorist, is seen advising Epstein on how to manage the fallout from his conviction.

Other documents contradict what prominent people have said about their connections to Epstein. Elon Musk, for example, is one of the world’s foremost purveyors of Epstein conspiracism. He posted last fall that Epstein “tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED.” In fact, as The New York Times has reported, the files suggest that Musk was eager to go: “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” he emailed Epstein in 2012. Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, has claimed that he vowed in the mid-2000s to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.” The files show him emailing Epstein in 2012 to arrange a family visit to Epstein’s private island.

More unseemly or even criminal material may well come out. Perhaps evidence will even emerge to prove that Epstein systematically trafficked minors to other men or blackmailed them over legal but secret liaisons. But so far, none has.

Elizabeth Bruenig: Circles of Epstein hell

Because the Epstein conspiracy theory is treated as reality by so many, however, merely appearing in the files seems to be grounds for suspicion. And because Epstein cultivated as many high-profile contacts as possible, that leaves a whole lot of people potentially exposed to unfounded insinuations. A Daily Beast headline over the weekend, for example, declared of the journalist Nellie Bowles, “MAGA-Curious CBS Boss’s Wife Busted Ingratiating Herself With Epstein.” In fact, the files show Bowles, who is now married to CBS News head Bari Weiss, emailing with Epstein to interview him for a New York Times story. An Inside Higher Ed article published Tuesday lists nine academics who appear in the files and notes that this puts “pressure on those named to explain their communications”—as many of them then do, in statements to their campus newspapers. A sure way to get engagement on social media is to extrapolate recklessly from suggestive nuggets of information. J. K. Rowling evidently felt compelled to issue a statement contradicting files-based accusations that she had invited Epstein to the opening of her Harry Potter musical.

Epstein committed horrific acts against a staggering number of women and girls, but, judging from the available evidence, he was not at the center of a global pedophilia ring that included dozens of criminal co-conspirators. The apparent truth is somehow even more depressing. Smarmy jerks can get obscenely wealthy in this country just by managing other people’s money. Men who sexually abuse women and children can be charming. The most accomplished people in our society can be terrible judges of character. They can, in the pursuit of proximity to wealth and power, ignore or downplay what’s right in front of them. The Epstein files show us that the world is an ugly and unfair place. But we already knew that.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A few hours after Tom Homan announced a drawdown of federal forces in Minneapolis this week, the rest of President Trump’s fractious immigration team gathered at the border wall in Arizona for a speech by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Gusty desert winds coated everyone in dust and blew Noem’s hair wildly around her ball cap.

The event was tightly choreographed to project unity. Noem praised Homan, the White House “border czar” and her rival for control of the immigration crackdown. She sat beside the Homan ally Rodney Scott, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, whom she and her team have spent the past several months trying to sideline. Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement who has also seen his authority diminish under Noem, was there too, crediting her and the president. The one notably absent figure was Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander Noem sent storming into Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, and other cities, turning him into the face of the rolling crackdown. Bovino’s agents killed Alex Pretti on January 24. Now Bovino was off the team, “a pretty out-there kind of guy,” Trump called him, so thoroughly erased that no one at Noem’s event even mentioned his name.

The secretary’s speech hit the familiar notes, hammering Joe Biden’s border record and celebrating the steep drop in illegal crossings under Trump. It showed the administration’s eagerness to shift attention to the border, where the president’s harsh measures are popular, and away from Minneapolis, where they are not.

Although it is too early to say whether Pretti’s killing will mark a turning point in Trump’s second administration, it has forced a pivot in his immigration team’s tactics and command structure. Homan has ended roving street patrols and told ICE officers to go back to conducting more targeted, disciplined operations that prioritize catching criminals over raw arrest numbers. “This is smart law enforcement, not less law enforcement,” he said this week. Homan, who ran ICE during part of Trump’s first term, pledged to hold officers accountable for misconduct—a much different message than the one DHS broadcast last month when it promoted a clip of Stephen Miller saying they had broad immunity.

If Miller took the Trump administration to the brink in Minneapolis, Homan seemed to be looking for a reset—but not a retreat. “We’re not backing down at all,” he said on Fox News. “Mass deportations will continue.”

Homan’s return has been welcomed by nearly all of the career ICE and CBP officials I’ve been in touch with, many of whom say that Trump’s deportation campaign—whose goals they largely share—will be more effective if it is more low-key and less provocative. That means returning to a focus on immigrants with criminal records (including those with nonviolent offenses such as illegally reentering the United States) and those who disobey deportation orders from immigration courts.

Homan has worked under Democratic administrations—he received an award from President Obama in 2015—and is well versed in the arguments about public safety and crime that ICE leaders have long used to defend the agency when its legitimacy has come under attack. It was Homan who, after Trump appointed him to lead ICE in 2017, famously said that officers would be freed from “the shackles” of tighter oversight. Now it’s Homan’s job to restore some of those restraints.

At the White House, Miller is still running 10 a.m. conference calls six days a week to issue orders and demand updates on the metrics that matter most to him: deportations, new-ICE-officer deployments, and prosecutions. ICE field commanders have not been waved off the ambitious arrest quotas he set last May, and they remain under orders to maintain staffing levels at 70 percent, even on the weekends, two current officials told me.

Activists in Minneapolis say they’ve seen little change, and the city still feels besieged. But Homan has made some significant moves: Border Patrol agents are now embedded with ICE, not roaming the streets on their own, and they’re under orders to avoid confrontations with activists. Homan and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles have held regular calls with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey since Trump talked to him on January 26, according to a senior administration official and an aide to Frey. Trump officials want Frey to help calm protests, and Homan has withdrawn 700 federal agents and officers so far. A goal discussed inside the White House would be the withdrawal of the remaining 2,000 or so federal forces over the next two weeks, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations. A DHS official deployed to Minneapolis described that timeline as “ambitious,” although Homan has said publicly that the drawdown can quicken if protesters stay out of ICE’s way.

Trump has changed his tune too, telling NBC News during an Oval Office interview that aired this week: “Maybe we could use a little bit of a softer touch.”

I spoke with half a dozen current and former immigration-enforcement officials about how Trump’s mass-deportation campaign may change after Minneapolis, especially with polls showing that one of the president’s top-rated issues is becoming a political liability. Several said they expect ICE operations to continue aggressively, but with less of the publicity and propaganda that DHS has indulged in for months. “No more videos from convenience stores,” one veteran official said, referring to social-media clips made by Bovino’s film crew that show him shopping for energy drinks and high-fiving supporters.

Sixty-five percent of Americans think ICE has gone too far in conducting Trump’s crackdown, according to a poll published Thursday by Marist/PBS News/NPR, and two-thirds of independent voters disapprove of the job ICE is doing. As support for the anti-ICE protest movement has reached new heights, opposition to the crackdown has morphed into a cultural moment, illustrated by the various Grammy-speech denunciations last week and Bruce Springsteen’s new song “Streets of Minneapolis.” During a live broadcast of a pro-wrestling event in Las Vegas on Wednesday, rowdy chants of “Fuck ICE” broke out.

Three consecutive presidencies have been sidetracked by immigration-policy overreach. During Trump’s first term, he tried to stem illegal crossings by implementing a family-separation policy that stripped thousands of children from their parents at the border, triggering such a massive backlash that the president’s own family members urged him to reverse course. The cruelty of the episode galvanized Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterms, and remains one of the biggest political debacles of Trump’s first term.

Trump’s family separations mobilized liberal activist groups who helped Biden win in 2020. Biden took office under pressure to repudiate Trump’s policies and formulate a more inclusive and welcoming message to immigrants. He issued more day-one executive orders on immigration than on any other topic. His policies—a reduction in border controls and ICE enforcement—sent a powerful message to people across the world who wanted to come to the United States. Within two months, Biden’s presidency was ensnared in a crisis at the border as crossings broke records and generated politically damaging images of chaos from which he never recovered. When Biden took steps to tighten enforcement, immigration advocacy groups blasted him for emulating Trump. Conservative anger helped turn out Trump supporters in 2024, and Miller, Homan, and Scott served as surrogates for the president’s campaign, depicting him as the candidate of law and order.

On his return to office, Trump imposed strict border controls and an asylum ban that has sent illegal crossings plunging to their lowest levels since the 1960s. But if Trump has succeeded at eliminating scenes of chaos along the southern border, his team has created them in U.S. cities. Miller, the mastermind of Trump’s deportation blitz, has consistently pushed the president to take the most aggressive measures possible, but his shock-and-awe tactics raced far ahead of ICE’s ability to sustain them. The president signed his “big, beautiful bill” in July, which allots $170 billion to build more border wall, hire 10,000 deportation officers, and fund a sprawling immigration detention system with the capacity to hold 100,000 people. But a campaign against blue cities designed by Miller, Noem, and her close adviser Corey Lewandowski has burned through the president’s political capital faster than the money could be spent. ICE is now flush with cash right at a moment when public backlash is turning the agency into a pariah.

Homan is looking for modest wins in Minnesota, going county by county to request closer cooperation with sheriffs and police departments. He says that he is not asking for jurisdictions to hold immigrants who have completed their sentences on ICE’s behalf, only to notify the agency when they are set to release someone with a criminal record. ICE has sometimes struggled to complete these jail pickups even after the agency receives notice, mostly for lack of personnel. With thousands of additional ICE officers scheduled to deploy over the coming months, administration officials told me that the agency will be able to pick people up at higher rates, and take them into custody from inside jails, safely and out of sight.

Trump scored a significant legal victory late Friday when a three-judge panel from the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals backed an administration policy implemented last summer that denies bond hearings for immigrants in ICE jails facing deportation, regardless of how long they’ve lived in the United States. The matter is likely headed to the Supreme Court, but the policy change is central to the White House’s plan to supercharge the immigration detention system and the pace of deportations. Officers don’t need to seize people in the street when it can get them in courthouse hallways and mundane federal buildings when ICE calls them in for appointments.

Republican lawmakers had been in lockstep behind the president’s mass-deportation plan, but signs of dissent have popped up since Pretti’s killing. Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi sent a letter to Noem this week opposing DHS plans to open an ICE detention center in his district. Some GOP members have questioned Noem’s leadership or called for her to resign.

Democrats’ demands for changes to ICE operations are driving Congress to another possible shutdown as soon as next week. They are calling for a ban on the use of face masks by ICE and tighter rules on the use of force and search authorities, as well as a return to policies that limit ICE operations at schools, churches, hospitals, and other sensitive locations. They also want Noem fired.

Noem has already agreed to one of their demands—expanding ICE’s use of body cameras—a move that drew frustration among White House officials who thought she too quickly gave away a bargaining chip, according to one administration official. The official said that Noem’s standing with Trump remains shaky, despite his public statements backing her.

Speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Trump told the audience he’d been asked by NBC if he planned to fire Noem. “Why would I do that?” Trump said. “We have the strongest border in the history of our country.”

One thing the Melania documentary is not is a documentary, at least in the traditional journalistic understanding of the genre. There is no backstory, no interviews with friends or family that might help you understand the main character better, and scant introspection—deep or shallow—from the subject herself. The film follows Melania Trump through the 20 days leading up to her husband’s second inauguration, hitting the same highlights you’d expect in a “Get ready with me” wedding video. She is seen approving invitations, trying on her dress, and, at one point, approving an appetizer that consists of caviar stuffed into a literal golden egg. Occasionally she interacts with staff, her husband, a foreign first lady, but mostly she is alone, even when tepidly doing the YMCA dance.

So what even is Melania? Is it, as critics have suggested, a mockumentary, propaganda, the “hard launch of a new lifestyle brand?” Or, as the Atlantic critic Sophie Gilbert suggests, is it something more akin to a “a two-hour perfume commercial”? The film’s premiere at the Kennedy Center, featuring vastly more government officials than celebrities, implies another possibility. Maybe this can be classified as one of President Trump’s attempts to show the world what he wants American culture to be: glitzy, fabulous—more Les Mis, less Hamilton, as he suggested on one of his recent tours of the Kennedy Center.

Another of Gilbert’s descriptors is perhaps the most apt: “Melania the movie isn’t a documentary; it’s a protection racket,” she wrote, considering that Amazon, which has many business dealings with the government, licensed it for $40 million, far above the next highest bid. Amazon reps have insisted the company invested so heavily in the film because they “think customers are going to love it.” In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to Gilbert about the movie, about the real Melania, and about President Trump’s efforts to shape culture.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: The Melania movie follows the first lady for 20 days leading up to the inauguration. It shows her trying on her dress, reviewing invitations, getting in and out of planes, meeting with other first ladies, trying the dress on again. She looks absolutely flawless in every shot, from glossy waves to Louboutins.

It’s called a documentary, but that’s a real stretch.

Sophie Gilbert: It’s much more in the vein of a commercial. When you think documentary, you think a sort of journalistic endeavor or a real portrait of someone or something. But this is entirely, entirely Melania Trump–approved.

It really felt to me like a two-hour perfume commercial.

Rosin: That is staff writer Sophie Gilbert, who saw the movie in London. I, by the way, saw it in Northern Virginia, and many of the 25 or so people in the theater with me seemed into it, just for the record.

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. In her review of the movie, Sophie wrote, “The movie isn’t a documentary; it’s a protection racket.”

Amazon paid $40 million to license the film and another $35 million on marketing. Their reps said they invested so much because “we think customers are going to love it.”

Maybe. But bidding well over double the next-highest offer suggests that you might be paying for more than just the movie.

Gilbert:  It definitely feels like Amazon was paying way, way, way over the odds for a documentary, not because they believe that this would be a work of cinematic genius, the like of which none of us have ever seen, but because they wanted to keep [Donald] Trump happy and on the side of Amazon in case that happened to be useful.

Gilbert: Hi! Thank you so much for having me.

Rosin: So we don’t know when this movie will come to streaming, so I think we need to describe it for our audience. What happens in this movie? What’s its narrative structure?

Gilbert: I think I can start by saying not much happens. (Laughs.) It’s about an hour, 45, I wanna say, and usually, with documentaries, there’s some kind of dramatic crux. There’s a structure to it. There’s a narrative arc. There is not in this movie.

The first shot, it’s sort of astonishing ’cause you go and you really don’t know what to expect. I went in cold—no reviews were out. Nothing had been written about Melania by this point. And there’s this Rolling Stones (Laughs.) “Gimme Shelter” needle drop. And then you see drone footage of Mar-a-Lago.

It does not look like a documentary. It’s so expensively shot. The visuals are high, high, high quality. And then I think the first shot of Melania is a pair of red Christian Louboutin heels, thousand-dollar shoes, and the camera kind of pans up, and you see her like she’s a massive celebrity, which she is, but it’s really like Beyoncé kind of setup and framing.

I’ve, for my sins, have read a lot of books about Melania Trump by this point, so I do feel like I have a kind of a sense of who she is, and none of that comes through in this movie. It is entirely visuals. She looks absolutely stunning. Her clothes are amazing.

They film her walking from place to place. She’s always walking. She’s always wearing heels. I think right at the end of the movie, she takes her heels off for a second, but otherwise, she’s in five-inch stilettos pretty much the whole way through.

But there’s no sense at all of who she is. She speaks in all these aphorisms about living life with purpose and how ardently she believes in the Constitution and these very weird sound bites that come through that have nothing to do with what’s happening on-screen or what her husband, certainly, is doing as president.

Rosin: So what were some of the big scenes that stuck with you? Because (Laughs.) I feel like anyone listening is gonna have an odd, disjointed view. They’re literally not gonna understand what is happening. Is she just walking from place to place during this movie?

Gilbert: Yeah, it’s about as boring as that sounds, actually. (Laughs.) I wrote my notes—she begins at Mar-a-Lago boarding a plane. She goes to New York. She gets fitted for her inauguration clothes.

Brett Ratner is the director, and we can get into him for a moment later. (Laughs.) But you can see him desperate for action and for drama, because there’s a scene where a costume assistant has to try and cut her blouse with scissors, and their hand is sort of trembling with fear.

From there, she goes to Washington. She goes to Jimmy Carter’s funeral. She goes to St. Patrick’s Cathedral and talks a little bit about losing her mother. She goes back to Washington, back to Mar-a-Lago. There’s the inauguration; she goes to three balls.

Rosin: Having not read her biography, I have to say I did learn some things. I’m not sure I learned directly some things in the way that you would if somebody sat down and interviewed someone, but I did learn—she was alone so much of the time—at least things that made me think. Like, Why is there no one else in this picture?

I learned about her fashion sense. She’s essentially wearing menswear a lot of the time, and black and white. I found that to be very interesting. Her interest is not fashion, per se, at least in this administration; it’s tailoring, which is different.

Gilbert: Yeah. Kate Bennett wrote a book called Free, Melania, and she wrote up her theory, which is that whenever Melania Trump is annoyed at Donald, she dresses in menswear because he prefers this very feminine aesthetic of dresses and pink and women being extra feminine. So Kate Bennett writes about how, in 2018, the year that the Stormy Daniels scandal came out, Melania wore a lot of tailoring. (Laughs.) There were a lot of suits, a lot of pinstripe that year. So I found that interesting in the context of this movie, where she is, again, wearing quite formal, quite tailored masculine clothing.

But, no, I think the things that were fascinating about this movie, maybe fascinating is the wrong word, mildly interesting—

Gilbert: —you see how much she exists in this bubble, and it seems to be a real bubble that, I would say, is probably one that many famous and ultrarich and ultra-privileged people live in, where there’s no friction.

She walks smoothly through these liminal spaces: She’s at the airport boarding the plane, and she’s in a hallway, she’s in a freight elevator with Secret Service. She gets in a car; there’s no traffic because they’ve cleared the roads. And she goes to St. Patrick’s Cathedral; they’ve cleared all the people out so that she can go in privately. It’s this very smooth, curated, manufactured reality, I think, where nothing annoys her; nothing really gets in her way. She’s just sort of moving from place to place without anyone.

There are no friends. She has sort of supplicants—she has her trusted wardrobe designers and the people designing the themes for the balls, the events planners—and everyone is very deferential to her, and it doesn’t seem that sincere a relationship. Maybe it is when the cameras are off.

But you don’t even see her have a conversation with her son. (Laughs.) You see Barron, but he doesn’t speak in the movie. They don’t have any interaction. She has a few scenes with Donald, and that was interesting to me, is how Melania seems to be the only person in the world that Donald can stand sharing the limelight with. We know that he is very much (Laughs.) an enjoyer of attention, and yet, when Melania is the focus, it doesn’t seem to bother him. He seems proud. He seems sort of genuinely enthralled by her in a way that I was not quite expecting.

Rosin: That’s so interesting because what struck me was a little bit the opposite of that, which is the nature of their conversations, the tone they use to talk to each other. That’s what’s really stuck in my brain.

The first time we actually hear Trump’s voice is when he calls her on the phone.

Melania Trump: Hi, Mr. President. Congratulations!

Gilbert: Yes. She is in New York, and he’s in Washington. The votes have just been ratified, and he is officially president-elect. And she’s like, Oh, please stop talking. (Laughs.)

Rosin: (Laughs.) She hasn’t even seen it.

Gilbert: She’s like, Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. (Laughs.)

Rosin: And he starts talking to her literally exactly like he talks to us, the American people. He’s like (Imitates Donald Trump’s voice.) It’s the best thing that’s ever happened. It’s the biggest victory ever—

Gilbert: (Speaks simultaneously and imitates Trump’s voice.) The biggest victory ever. Yep.

Gilbert: (Imitates Trump’s voice.) Numbers they’ve never seen before.

Rosin: Never seen—but he’s talking to his wife.

There’s also the scene where they’re dancing at the inaugural ball, this very staged moment where she is supposed to, I think, perform adoration, and she can’t do it. She seems like she can’t wait for him to stop touching her. She’s leaning away from him as far back as she can. The body language, I think, speaks (Laughs.) possibly more in that scene than Melania does.

Rosin: You had the absolutely most brilliant insight about her inauguration dress, which was a white dress with black ribbons—we’ll say ribbons. It’s an incredibly constructed dress. They do talk about it a lot, how it has no seams showing. (Laughs.)

Gilbert: Yeah. You can’t see the seams; it’s just like Melania. (Laughs.)

Rosin: I’m gonna make you repeat your line because it was so good.

Gilbert: Well, it was all I could think of when I saw it now. She has this white dress with these stark black lines across it, and looking at it now, from the context of 2026, it just looks like the redacted Epstein files. (Laughs.)

Rosin: I think anybody seeing this film will never see anything but that. Again, it’s exactly what it looks like: redaction ink. It’s amazing.

Gilbert: Her style—again, her colors are black and white. (Laughs.) I think that by itself is interesting when we’re thinking about First Ladies and how pastel they often are and how Michelle Obama always famously had to wear a lot of sort of J.Crew tea dresses and things like that.

Melania, she’s black and white. She’s not worried about trying to perform a version of herself that she doesn’t feel connected to.

Rosin: Another great moment, and this one you can help me read. Actually, this was my favorite moment in the movie, when I felt like there was a peek of Melania, she felt sort of grounded to me, is when she, towards the end—they’ve done the dance, they’ve gone through the inauguration party, and she looks straight at the camera, and she says, “Here we go again.” How did you read that?

Gilbert: I read it as made for the trailer, which is exactly (Laughs.) where it ended up.

Gilbert: It’s really funny because there’s a moment at the beginning of the movie too where she says, “Everyone wants to know, so here it is: family, business, philanthropy, and becoming first lady of the United States—again.” And the “again” is so classic ’80s sitcom, like: Record scratch. Freeze-frame. Here’s how I ended up here. (Laughs.)

But all the things that she’s promising do not come through at all in the movie. There’s no sense of family. There’s no sense of philanthropy. There’s very little about business. You do see her becoming first lady of the United States a little bit.

It’s sort of funny. It’s like there are these moments almost where you see what it could have been if it were a real documentary and not this sort of brochurelike version of Melania.

Rosin: After the break: how Melania Trump’s film fits into Donald Trump’s America.

Rosin: So the movie premiered at the Kennedy Center. There was no mainstream press there, just administration officials and tech people. And then, shortly after that, Trump announced he was closing the Kennedy Center for this two-year renovation, to build what he called a “new and spectacular Entertainment Complex.” In your head, are these two events connected?

Gilbert: God, it’s more representative to me, I think, of so much that Trump touches seems to die. (Laughs.) I’m thinking about his career running casinos in New Jersey and all his multiple bankruptcies.

He famously took over the Kennedy Center—which was renovated, by the way, in 2019; it’s not that desperately in need of a makeover. (Laughs.) He put his name on the Kennedy Center, and immediately, artists have refused to perform there; they’ve dropped out. The Washington National Opera has removed itself from the Kennedy Center. There’s this real sort of rush to flee. And as a result, I think, it’s probably hemorrhaging money, and Trump is now closing it for two years.

But I think what was interesting about the premiere was who wasn’t there. And really, when you think about who attended, there weren’t any mainstream celebrities other than Nicki Minaj—Nicki Minaj, who, recently, I think, has been tweeting during the Grammys about the musicians who were involved in satanic cults. (Laughs.) So that was their big mainstream cultural figure who they could get to come along. And I’m not sure that it demonstrates the sort of clout in culture’s world, at least, that they were hoping to show.

Rosin: It is the Trump administration’s open wish to control the culture, and then there’s the sort of two possibilities of it.

I was thinking, on the one hand, I have read about days when there were state-run television, where you’d have ballets and operas about great administration triumphs, and there would be Melania films every day, and we could all go see them. That is a world we’ve read about in history, and it did feel to me like that, like some weird authoritarian future of culture.

On the other hand, like you said, it felt kind of sad. There is no state-run television—in a world of infinite sources of entertainment, that’s impossible—and so it just feels a little like failure and a way for rich donors to curry favor. It’s hard to see how it’s gonna take off. It’s both scary but also seems maybe not possible.

Gilbert: Yeah. Our colleague Spencer Kornhaber wrote a really good piece about this recently and about how Trump is desperate to control culture, to put his stamp on it, to have his word be law, and to be in charge of what happens. And he famously loves music and DJs at Mar-a-Lago from his iPad.

But what he can’t control, Spencer argued, was what people actually want. He can’t manage to be the person who controls public taste. And I think that’s the thing that Melania is butting up against.

And from what I can tell, the audience who’s going to see it, they have been very divided along party lines. The idea that this would be a film with mainstream appeal, I think, it’s not happening.

Rosin: I guess the mid possibility is that it’s propaganda that works some of the time. Like, okay, we can discuss this around the Melania film and immigration.

Rosin: The film was coming out around the time of the Minneapolis shootings and the sort of mayhem in Minneapolis and the tragedy there. Melania is maybe the most famous immigrant in the U.S. right now.

And would you agree that immigration came up a lot—like, the theme of immigration was there?

Gilbert: It came up in the movie, but not in a meaningful way. It was fascinating ’cause there were all these moments in the film where Melania would say things that sounded nice but were completely at odds with things that her husband is doing and really sort of crumble under any gentle prodding or—not even interrogation.

But there’s sort of no deeper analysis of that in the movie. So she does have this scene with the White House interior designer, who is an immigrant from Laos, who says, You and I were the American dream, or something like that, and the moment doesn’t even really land because you’re not allowed to consider what it means that these people are decorating the White House that Trump will live in while he is also staging mass deportations of immigrants. There’s none of that tension.

And so all these moments, they felt very strange to me because—and none of it makes sense. It’s all in conflict with what we know if we’re following politics in this moment. But the director of the movie does absolutely nothing to sort of dig at that tension in an interesting way.

Rosin: The director, Brett Ratner, tell us about that.

Gilbert: Brett Ratner is a Hollywood film director. He is best known for the Rush Hour franchise. He makes action movies, these sort of big blockbusters, tentpole films.

In 2017, during the outpouring of sort of allegations and accusations that came out during what we now call the #MeToo movement, Brett Ratner was alleged to have harassed and sexually assaulted half a dozen women, some of them very famous women. The actresses Olivia Munn and Natasha Henstridge were among the women who came out with accusations against Brett Ratner.

And he denied them all but has not made a film since. And so Melania is his return to filmmaking. It’s definitely not the kind of product that I think he would be making if he had his druthers, but the Trumps seemed to have seen no problem with giving him this assignment. Trump is supposedly a very big fan of the Rush Hour franchise and is hoping for a new installment.

Rosin: Is there something explicit, like Melania’s jacket? What did her jacket say? I don’t care?

Rosin: I really don’t care, do u? Is that explicit? Or is it just Donald Trump likes the Rush Hour franchise, and they’re not really thinking about it?

Gilbert: Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who worked with Melania, has also written a book about her, called Melania and Me, and she wrote in that book that Melania doesn’t do shame. She’s not sentimental, and she won’t be forced to feel something that she doesn’t feel. And so I really do think, when it comes to moral quandaries like this, she won’t perform something that she doesn’t feel, if that makes sense.

And so in terms of Brett Ratner being a friend of the family—he’s moved in the same circles as Trump for a long time. I think he has a place in Florida.

I can understand why he took this job; I’m sure I would be desperate to work again too. But it’s a strange project for him to take, and I think, as we see in the movie, it’s definitely not his natural talent.

Rosin: Yeah, I did wonder if there could have been a version of this movie that had more robust alternate storytelling—like, there is an airbrushed version of Melania’s life story that is rich and interesting. I have no idea if it’s true.

But it was interesting to me that they chose no backstory. There was no pictures of her in Slovenia, no pictures of her as a young child, as a model. The “immigrant makes good” storyline was not present at all and, I thought, would be kind of interesting, even if not fact-checkable.

Gilbert: Yeah, no, I do think her story is a fascinating one. But again, it’s hard to tell how much of what she says is actually reflective of what actually happened.

I think during Melania the movie, she talks about her mother as a fashion designer, which is slightly, I think, overplaying her mother’s actual job; she was a patternmaker in state-owned children’s clothing factory in Slovenia.

So there’s sort of the story that she tells, which is, Trump often describes her as a supermodel—there’s this idea that she had this flourishing modeling career. But in reality, I think she had this very ’80s aesthetic during the ’90s as a model, and she didn’t quite fit during the fashion moment, so a lot of the ads that she got were commercials or she did an ad for Camel cigarettes. She definitely worked as a model, but the idea that she was up there with the Kate Mosses and the Naomi Campbells at the time is definitely not true.

But even in a deep-dive analysis of the superficial aspects that she presents—that’s why I find the fashion thing so fascinating, the idea that she wears men’s tailoring when she’s angry at her husband. (Laughs.) She gives us so little, but there is definitely fodder to dig into in a more thorough and curious way. But I think that’s not what Melania the film is about.

Rosin: So the movie ends—do you remember how it ends—by emphasizing her remaking the role of first lady.

Gilbert: Yes, her peace letter to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. (Laughs.)

Rosin: Yes. (Laughs.) This part is interesting ’cause it’s entirely in text; there’s nothing to look at. It’s just text on the screen, and it’s a lot of text. It’s like reading a sort of AI summary of My Accomplishments. But the accomplishments are very much in line with past first ladies.

Gilbert: Yeah. But it’s funny too because I think they realize by the end of the movie that they really have given us nothing. (Laughs.)

Gilbert: So there’s this rush to kind of unfurl actual accomplishments. But it’s funny too because there’s a scene in the film where she talks about her accomplishments as first lady. She’s like, Oh, I renovated the Rose Garden, which her husband turned into a patio. (Laughs.) She talks about working in the East Wing, which her husband turned into a pile of rubble. There’s all these moments where she sort of very happily talks about things that she’s done, but there’s no acknowledgment of where they stand now.

And so you do have this sort of wall of text at the end saying that she’s worked for children in the foster-care community, and she’s rallied on behalf of the Take It Down Act, which is involving pictures online, and this peace letter to Putin, which I did not know about (Laughs.)and, obviously, I don’t think it really has worked if the goal was managing peace between Russia and Ukraine, but sort of questionable accomplishments. But it does seem to reflect a small amount of panic from the filmmaker regarding what he’s actually been able to tell us.

Rosin: So often, when we talk about first ladies, they are a marker for gender and feminism in the U.S. at that moment, what we take away from it. Thinking in those terms, since you’re somebody who does think in those terms, what do you take away from this movie? Is it the act of ultimate control by a first lady over her own image? Is it retrograde? How do you read it?

Gilbert: It feels to me like an extension of what so many people do on Instagram now, which is curate their own reality and curate their own sense of self in a way that is very controlled and very intentional but also very flat and often not that fun to engage with.

But in terms of femininity at the moment, I do find that fascinating because I would say so much of femininity in this moment, and especially in conservative circles, is about this kind of weaponized performance of not just femininity, but also wealth, this very obvious work that people are willing to put in to look the right way, to sort of perform in a way that Trump might find pleasing.

That is very of this moment. And certainly, the unabashed performance of wealth, I think, is something that we have become very used to online and may be getting sick of right now? I personally feel sick of it, but maybe I’m the only one.

Rosin: Well, Sophie, thank you so much for talking through this movie, both as an actual movie and as an object in the culture and what it might mean. I appreciate it.

Gilbert: Oh, it was my pleasure. Thank you for having me.

            <h2>A Very Retro Olympics Opening Ceremony</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/milan-cortina-winter-olympics-opening-ceremony/685918/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every Olympics opening ceremony is an advertisement—for the host country, for the Olympics themselves, for the notion of a free-trading global order competing through sport, in the same place and on even ground. This year, the ceremony for the Winter Olympics, held in the Italian cities Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, was also an advertisement for the past.

This focus on the old is, well, new. Although every ceremony is, to some degree, a celebration of the host country’s history, the event has recently tended to feel like a technology-conference keynote, or a music festival. Two years ago, in Paris, organizers turned the seventh arrondissement into a light show and devoted considerable airtime to the Minions. Beijing’s event, in 2022, looked uncannily like a laptop screensaver. The year prior, at the opening for the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games, the mood was painfully contemporary, with a minimalist soundtrack and drones flying overhead. Everyone wants to reinvent the wheel, and the Olympics are a chance to show off on the world’s biggest stage. Usually, it seems, this is accomplished via lots and lots of LEDs.

This year’s ceremony, by contrast, opened with a pair of dancers in angel wings reenacting the neoclassical sculpture Psyche Revived by Cupid’s Kiss, which was created about 100 years before the invention of the lightbulb. The show then ran through a psychedelic tribute to a bygone Italy, a sort of live highlight reel of hundreds of years of civilization, rendered bonkersly but quaintly: Color-saturated Roman centurions marched solemnly in line with people dressed as moka pots; visual gags celebrated pasta, paparazzi, the film La Dolce Vita. At one point, the great composers Verdi, Puccini, and Rossini appeared in bobblehead proportions, like the guys who run the bases at Minor League baseball games: history turned into a cartoon, very literally.

At nearly every moment, the reference point was somewhere from decades to millennia in the past. The violinist Giovanni Andrea Zanon played a 300-year-old Stradivarius; a phalanx of models strutted around in classic suits in the colors of the Italian flag; the actress Sabrina Impacciatore paid tribute to the Olympics’ more recent past via an extended dance sequence set in the 1970s and ’80s. Even Mariah Carey, the show’s major modern performer, was dressed like an Old Hollywood starlet in a sparkly dress and a voluminous ostrich-feather stole; she sang an exceptionally breathy version of “Nel blu, dipinto di blu,” which came out in 1958.

Maybe all of this is to be expected for a country whose best-known cultural influences lived during the Renaissance. But the production itself was also undeniably retro: The lights were minimal, the music mostly classical, the choreography traditional. With a few exceptions, the entire show could have been produced anytime in the past 40 years.

Before the opening ceremony, people gathered in the streets to protest the governments of various countries competing, as well as the festivities’ very existence amid a major affordability crisis in Milan. During the Games, organizers will be using 3 million cubic yards of artificial snow: In Northern Italy, as in all over the world, the sky can no longer be reliably expected to behave like it used to. The 2028 Summer Games, to be held in Los Angeles, are already beset by concerns about cost overruns. The Olympics are one of our oldest global institutions, which is another way of saying they are a bit archaic—of, and invented in, a different world. The future is uncertain; best to focus on the past.</div>

            <h2>Why Trump Is Picking Fights With Big U.S. Banks</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/trump-jp-morgan-lawsuit-picking-fights-banks/685921/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

For as long as the Trump family has been cashing in on crypto, Don Jr., Eric, and their affiliates have deployed a particular narrative about their reasons for investing in the industry. Back in 2024, before the launch of a crypto empire that has now reportedly added at least $867 million to the family fortune, Don Jr. said on his podcast that digital assets were “obviously very appealing to guys like me who have been debanked”—an umbrella term for being cut off from a financial institution—“because they don’t check certain boxes.”

That same narrative is behind the president’s current legal assault on major banks. When Donald Trump returned to office last year, he started going after some of the businesses and individuals who he believed had wronged him in the past. On the list were universities, white-shoe law firms, and some of America’s largest banks. In a recent $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, which follows a similar suit from last year against Capital One, Trump alleged that he had been debanked on unfair grounds. In court filings, he accused each firm of closing his accounts in 2021 due to “political and social motivations” and “unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs” that they needed to distance themselves “from President Trump and his conservative political views.” (The JPMorgan suit, which the company said has “no merit,” arrived a day after Dimon publicly criticized the president’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates; Capital One has also denied Trump’s allegations and filed a motion to dismiss the case.)

The Trumps were indeed cut off from some financial services in 2021. But although they claim that it had to do with political bias and checking “certain boxes,” there is likely a simpler explanation: the fact that, on January 6, the president fomented a riot at the Capitol and tried to overturn the results of a national election. In the weeks and months after the insurrection, Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank reportedly refused further dealings with Trump, and Capital One and JPMorgan closed many of his personal and business accounts. Part of the reason debanking has become such a flashpoint is that financial institutions aren’t required to explain to their customers why they’ve been cut off. Despite much speculation at the time, only Signature publicly provided reasoning for its decision, citing the Capitol attack.

Debanking is a nebulous concept. It can include loan denials as well as account closures for financial or nonfinancial reasons, and it can encompass broad actions across multiple banks as well as a single action at one bank. It’s not clear whether JPMorgan and Capital One actually discriminated against Trump on the basis of his political views. And even if they are found to have done so, the law is not clear on whether that’s illegal.

The legal experts I spoke with said that Trump’s argument is shaky. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prevents discrimination against customers on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, and age—but, crucially, not political alignment. Beyond that, banks are mostly free to choose whom they do business with. And financial dealings with Trump were considered risky well before January 6, thanks to his history of business failures. In 2016, The New York Times reported that some bankers had captured the sentiment in a neat, two-word phrase: Donald risk.

That risk was only exacerbated by the events of January 6 and by Trump’s impeachment soon after, when it became apparent that there would be some kind of reckoning for what had happened at the Capitol. Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told me that the riot was “very reasonable” grounds “for any institution to drop a client.” The banks “were wary of the public seeing them doing business with Trump-related organizations,” Graham Steele, a Stanford Law fellow who worked in the Treasury Department under Joe Biden, explained to me; they were also likely “worried that somehow the funds in their accounts would be found to have helped finance, frankly, an insurrection.”

Even outside of these lawsuits, Trump has argued that conservatives are often targets for debanking. Last summer, he signed an executive order intended to protect customers who are debanked because of their political or religious beliefs. Although this may sound good on paper, he’s focused on the wrong issue. A 2025 review from Reuters found that out of the thousands of complaints about closed bank accounts filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, fewer than 1 percent of them “include the terms ‘politics,’ ‘religion,’ ‘conservative’ or ‘Christian.’”

But exclusion from the American banking system remains a real problem, particularly for low-income people and people of color. There are few broad studies on the debanking phenomenon as Trump seems to understand it—but there’s plenty of data on the communities that have historically been excluded from the financial system. A 2023 report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that Black, Hispanic, and American Indian households were unbanked (meaning they have no checking or savings account) at much higher rates than white households, and that the share of households with no form of mainstream credit at all (credit cards, mortgages, car loans) was higher among lower-income and less-educated households.

“There are certain communities that have a legacy of having been redlined out of getting access to credit and financial services,” Steele said. “That’s the real debanking problem.” Trump’s lawsuits and executive order probably won’t do much to chip away at that systemic issue. The president may say that he is protecting those who face discrimination, but his goals here are, as usual, extremely personal.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

With this week’s announcement of massive cuts at The Washington Post, the paper’s Book World supplement earned a dismal distinction: It may be the only newspaper book-review section to have been killed twice. The first time was in 2009, when papers across the country were slashing books coverage in an attempt to stave off budgetary apocalypse. So when the Post relaunched Book World in 2022, readers and writers reacted with the same mixture of amazement and trepidation inspired by the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. The rebirth of a dead species was wonderful to see, but how would it end?

Explore. You’ve never seen Super Bowl betting like this before, Jacob Stern writes.

Read. In his new novel, Daniyal Mueenuddin attempts to bring together the stories of people whose lives rarely intersect in meaningful ways, Karan Mahajan writes.

mandate another note when they are presenting fake news - ie made up &#39;facts&#39; or stuff of high bias. There always has been spin in the news, especially when covering politics but these days it has got completely out of control. Things like BBC Verify [bbc.co.uk] help but are not nearly enough when faced with the huge torrent of lies generated by those of low morals who will do anything to benefit themselves.

I haven&#39;t ever seen any lies on CNN to be honest.  When they talk about Trump lying on this or that they generally give the evidence.  I can&#39;t say I watch FOX but it&#39;s hard to see how they could provide evidence for all the things they say.  The overall point being that true journalism is double and triple checked.  You don&#39;t just broadcast the words of the president verbatim without backing it up if there is true journalistic integrity.  They call it FOX news but without journalistic integrity they are rea

This law would be totally unenforceable for at least three reasons. First, I&#39;d like you to define &quot;AI&quot;. (The law will have to do that, and it will fail to do so in any meaningful fashion.) Second, prove to me in court that AI was used. Three, this law is obviously contrary to the US Constitution.

Another &quot;We&#39;re Doing Something About It&quot; theatrical gesture, with a taste of panic over how the world has been taken over by AI and there ain&#39;t a fucking thing anybody can do about it.

My arguments in reply of your concerns: 1) Definition: They don&#39;t have to define AI in the law; the newspaper are not going to invent some new mathematical approach, they are going to use commercial tools. The newspapers will self-incriminate by using tools that claim to be AI. Anyway LLM is another worg they can include.2) Proof in court: It is enforceable as any regulation of a process that isn&#39;t immediately visible (like in the food or water industry). A whistleblower will talk and bring internal emails.

Not generated by a human as it&#39;s been done for centuries. Now start splitting hairs and moving the goalposts.

Second, prove to me in court that AI was used.

See above. Start splitting the hairs more finely.

Three, this law is obviously contrary to the US Constitution.

The 1st Amendment prevents the abridging of the freedom of the press. Within that freedom is the choice of how to generate the material it puts on its pages and how to label it. That freedom also gives it the right to say whatever it likes and only to be held liable for severe defamation. In that context the bill is surely unconstitutional.

The problem here, of course, is that the freedom of the press is based on the assumption that journalists and editors can be expected to do the right thing. This has been

This sounds almost like normal life for me, but cloudflare are the offenders, not bing/Microsoft. Censorship on the Internet, USA style.

At first I thought this was just a stupid troll, but it&#39;s modded +5 insightful. But, I guess that I am out of the loop.

What are you referring to here? What does Microsoft delisting sites in their search index got to do with Cloudflare?

DuckDuckGo uses Bing.  It&#39;s good for long established web-pages, has less product-placement than Google and less AI than Google (although that&#39;s a mixed result).  Like Google, certain keywords and searching for recent events will be flooded by pop-culture drivel.

I use DuckDuckGo and DDG is underpinned by Bing.Most of the time the results are adequate although more obscure links are often broken - the sites have lapsed weeks earlier.  This is not always a bad thing, the broken links serve as input to the Wayback Machine.

it is obvious if you understand the concept of driving instead of mimicking it statistically with some probability.

a simple difference that the &quot;AI&quot; proponents and &quot;investors&quot; can&#39;t seem to grasp and acknowledge.

I&#39;m sure someone though of it. What&#39;s obvious from the failures is that model training isn&#39;t a substitute for understanding, which the model is lacking. So it will always have a nonzero chance to fuck up an obvious situation, which is what we mostly deal with.

Of course you&#39;ll have people arguing it isn&#39;t different with people on the account of the outcome (people are slower, get tired, etc) but the fundamental difference is the understanding, and the model doesn&#39;t have it.

What&#39;s obvious from the failures is that model training isn&#39;t a substitute for understanding, which the model is lacking. Even if the model doesn&#39;t have understanding, it can be trained to stop for school buses.

No, you cannot expect determinism from a fully probabilistic model. Someone must hardcode the laws of robotics in those positronic brainz, and we know that even that won&#39;t work.

the model inputs (road conditions, perceived bus color, etc) are always random.

Yes, they could, but at some point it will get way more expensive than a driver just because of all that hardware, while the original idea was, I presume, to replace the drivers for less. No idea how much is invested up to today and how the costs compare to the results achieved. I would guess they are still way more expensive than a driver.

I do disagree that there&#39;s a larger non zero chance to duck up an obvious situation for a machine than for a human driver. Perhaps the chance is larger for non obvious cases, but that will get fixed.

That should be the main point here .. that it isn&#39;t even self driving.

Actually, it is not exactly the same in all 50 states for multi-lane roads.  In the linked article it states that the Waymo vehicle was filmed breezing through the opposite lane of traffic.  The laws vary on opposing traffic depending on the state.

For a multi-lane road with only a turn lane separating the opposing traffic, Texas law requires opposing traffic to stop.  Texas school bus laws  [liggettlawgroup.com]

But for Washington state, Missouri, South Carolina, and a few others, a turn lane is enough separation to allow opposing

Sounds like self driving certification needs to be done on a per state basis. Even if that means some additional training and software is required to comply with state laws and potentially updated each year.

I would expect if a single driver racked up 25 safety violations involving school buses that their drivers license should be suspended.

Agreed. If I drove 25 different cars and got infractions in each, the government is going to be rather peeved with me.

Well, it is if you think of the driving software as a deterministic machine, as we are used to. If you have a toy truck, you can make it go where you want, but try that with a cat. The driving software is quite nearer the cat situation than the toy truck.

Austin ISD has asked Waymo to stop operating near schools during bus hours until the issue is resolved. Waymo refused.I would like to see the context behind why Waymo refused this request, prima facie it seems like a reasonable request.

I&#39;d say it&#39;s time to get the lawyers involved.

They obviously need more statistics to retrain the failing models. Knocking down a few kids in the process isn&#39;t a large cost, the investors will cover the damages.

By killing the slow unobservant kids Waymo is improving the human race, ready for the war against AI.

yeah, we&#39;ll have to evolve to deal with the &quot;AI&quot; bullshit. I guess we&#39;re too dumb to do it from first principles.

They might have had a legal right to refuse (I don&#39;t know). But if something like that comes up in a future civil injury case, it could be used to suggest a pattern of irresponsible behavior and lack of concern.

...failing to stop for buses during loading and unloading -- illegal in all 50 statesWell, maybe illegal or not, depending on the circumstances and depending on the state:
Not necessary to stop if the bus is in a loading zone that is completely off the road if crossing the road is not permitted.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction if the road has 4 or more lanes.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction if the road has a barrier between travel directions.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction if the road has a median.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction

...failing to stop for buses during loading and unloading -- illegal in all 50 states

Well, maybe illegal or not, depending on the circumstances and depending on the state:

I&#39;ve always found these rules poorly calibrated and overly conservative.basically based on moral panic about kids rather than logic about traffic laws and sharing the road fairly.

but there are no school buses where I currently live, so haven&#39;t been annoyed by it for a while.(tbh idk WHY there aren&#39;t buses or how kids get to school here.  )

Let me guess .... You don&#39;t have kids?  Only a non payment would call protecting kids on their way to school a &quot;moral panic&quot;.  This is exactly a place where they should be protected.  I know Americans are confused due to the prevelence of shooting galleries in schools.

No, no, Hitler escaped to Argentina, not Australia.  Seriously, have you ever driven in Australia?  They are absolutely mad for roundabouts.  But at least they are also scrupulous about signaling for them.

Diverging diamond interchanges and their bastard offspring, though?  I think those are the devil&#39;s own work.

Also an incident where a Waymo got confused on the interstate, which it is forbidden to even be on.

I can&#39;t believe someone hasn&#39;t thrown themselves off the fender or hood of a waymo and sued. I can&#39;t see a judge or jury finding in Waymo&#39;s favor...

Wasn&#39;t it 70 points for children under 12 and 100 points for the elderly?

Lol I remember that old lady with the walker sacrificing herself for the driver.

These robot cars are WAY MOre dangerous than I suspected!

These people are so dumb. Hollywood didn&#39;t go all in on computer graphics when they were shitty back in 1980, they waited until they got gud and made avatar in 2009. Maybe someday &quot;AI&quot; will get there but all these people betting the house on &quot;AI&quot; being perfect right out of the box are just stupid people. I wish there were consequences for their failures but that&#39;s not the way capitalism in this country seems to work anymore.

And yes, &quot;AI&quot; has been a thing since before computer graphics, but I&#39;m talking about &quot;AI&quot; as its being hyped in the last 4 years.

The slop problem is not the quality of the graphics. The slop problem is the lack of understanding of the task, which leads to the inevitable weirdness.

Suppose you make a movie and put all your savings into the production. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s $1m just as an arbitrary amount. Suppose the  bet fails and you&#39;ve lost your savings. Real consequence, and it hurts you. Now suppose the movie producer is Elon. Same outcome, same consequences. But he doesn&#39;t hurt, and will do another one right away.

Also, you can replace &quot;financing a movie&quot; with &quot;buying an election&quot; and reach the same conclusion.

The next memorable demonstrations are Tron, 1982 and the space-ship in The last Starfighter, 1984.

Chasing realism on a flat 2D surface was always a fool&#39;s errand. But dumping a bunch of money into post processing and editing is what investors want to see, as it is far more difficult to quantify storytelling and good acting. Studios and producers have become so risk adverse they run every film like a business, but are hamstrung by that very lack of risk taking when it comes to art. At best such films can only achieve the level of mediocre entertainment, although often profitable. But they are not films t

If AI themed movie is to do well, it has to have a well thought out storyline, preferred meaning to life.

Oh I forgot to mention.WarGames was shown in 1983.

Blade Runner, The Terminator, Short Circuit. We&#39;ve been watching films about AI all through the 80&#39;s.And of course before that there was 2001 and Metropolis.

Came here to say that. They should have used generative AI for things like crowds, scenery, monsters, where AI excels and nobody can tell if it&#39;s slightly off. AI is great in cutting the cost of something like LOTR. But human faces... the slightest detail off and it becomes a nightmare character; very unwise to start there.

Average people understand that and for LLM-type AI, experts understand that. Just the layer in between is still clueless and thinks it is the second coming.

In the not too distant past all the articles I saw were positive for AI.  So far this year the trend all seems to be not positive for AI and this article is just adding to it.  I&#39;m rather hoping that the more this sentiment builds, the less appetite there will be to cram AI into everything and we can start getting back to a world that isn&#39;t increasingly filled with AI slop.

Three movies mention AI as part of the plot and this means Hollywood has an AI boner right now? Have you watched Hollywood in the last... well, since it started? I mean, some of Slashdot&#39;s favorite movies are all about AI and none of them were made this year - The Terminator series, The Matrix, even Age of Ultron.

The reason these movies tanked are various but:

- Tron has never done well. We all want it to, but it&#39;s not going to happen. Additionally Aries had That Guy in it, and Aries also broke the formula by having it be set primarily in the real world. It just wasn&#39;t a good entry in a series that isn&#39;t very popular to begin with.- Mission Impossible is getting long in the tooth. It&#39;s arguably the only one of the three that could have done well, but the marketing did nothing to raise excitement for the movie. Also, no idea what the reviews were like, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, it seemed more contrived than usual.- The Megan &quot;series&quot; flopped because it was supposed to be an entertaining one off, and virtually everyone looking at it said &quot;Why the hell does it have a sequel&quot;.

I don&#39;t see any evidence Hollywood is doing an AI bet, they just released three movies that happened to be about AI in some form and happened to flop.

I saw only the first movie, it was fun 1980s style horror, just transplanted into more modern times.

Chris Pratt faces an AI judge bot played by Rebecca Ferguson; one reviewer has already called it &quot;the worst movie of 2026,&quot;
Worse than the robot in that Melania movie? :-)

(Also the trailer for Mercy said he has to prove his innocence. What happened to innocent until proven guilty?)

Sure, amd using scare quotes doesn&#39;t make something a bad idea.  It only implies you don&#39;t have a real argument.

surely there are ways to help &quot;small business&quot; however the GOP defines such without also giving a luscious handj...er, handshake to companies that have never paid their fair share

So you do admit they won&#39;t pass on any savings to you. They will split it between growing their business or giving it to investors, the only thing that makes sense. So it&#39;s one way, right? Taxes go up and they cut you deeper, taxes go down and they squeeze more juice. There&#39;s no upside. There&#39;s nothing for you to celebrate.

And you have to tax them or you can&#39;t use tax incentives to steer them the way you want like buying American, creating jobs not robots, whatever. Same thing you do with individual income

LOL. So you think Amazon lowered the prices with those billions in extra revenue. ROFLMAO.You need to be a shareholder.  Consumers pay all the taxes.  Shareholders benefit from all the tax breaks.

I can&#39;t tell if you are being sarcastic or if you really think this happened in the real world.

Consumers pass on their tax burden by spending less, you should fucking know.

It&#39;s a cycle, that&#39;s how the economy works, dipshit. All incomes should be tapped. Then tax incentives can be used to encourage behavior that benefits economic growth and social stability.

OFC some rich fucks want the tax burden moved entirely to personal income taxes, they get better effective tax rates there, it&#39;s pretty obvious what the play is.

Is this some dry satire or something? Isn&#39;t Amazon responsible for destroying small and local businesses with it&#39;s aggressive pricing policies and sellers fees? Didn&#39;t we witness the destruction of brick and mortar stores at the hands of Amazon just two decades prior?

No, that was Walmart, Target and Kroger in the 70s and 80s, Amazon didn&#39;t even start selling books online until 1996.

Small businesses get the exact same depreciation and R&D expense tax breaks as Amazon, but the numbers involved are proportionally smaller...

That&#39;s awesome, and it helps Amazon more. One of the last companies on the planet that needed a leg up. May their investments trickle upon you.

I am all for Amazon keeping the money they earned rather than turning it over to the government.The government shutdown for like thirty something days last year and I would not have known if I did not turn on the news.

You&#39;re posting from America, no the Libertarian Paradise of the Congo. You live somewhere that there is a strong government running the country then make-believe that the government doesn&#39;t matter.

You didn&#39;t notice the shutdown because the government forced essential workers to work for free. But I guess slavery is fine with you as long as corporations get their cut.

Compete until Amazon decides to enter your business sector, then you go bust or get bought.

Wasn&#39;t the debt a big concern a year ago or have tariffs reduced it as promised?

How many data centers did you build? How many warehouses?

Tax breaks for capital equipment depreciation are not new, R&D expenditures are often deductible too. I had to visit the senior bean counter more than once to find out if something was capital (therefore depreciated) or expense.

The new $1.6 billion dollar plant that was built in 2009 got tax breaks. The $12 million dollar pilot plant that was built for the next generation reactors (chemical not nuclear) was also depreciated as per schedule and cou

I for one don&#39;t have a problem with this. I give uncle Jeff a lot of money each year and I prefer he doesn&#39;t spend it frivolously in another country. Americans are pretty rich as it is, they don&#39;t need more money.

Now, ideally, uncle Jeff should pay his share of taxes in my country, but he&#39;s a greedy foreigner who manipulates public opinion and undercuts local businesses, so it&#39;s a work in progress.

Multi-national corporations by their very nature spend the money you give them (revenue) on other countries.

The tariff pung ping games have driven investment out of the US.  VW for example has reduced investment here and diverted it to China, because at least in China they know what the investment environment will be like a week from now.

It&#39;s good to be a well-funded sycophant of the king.

I&#39;m surprised to learn Amazon pays any taxes at all, so TIL they pay something; that&#39;s not nothing! Doing some quick maths here: Amazon put USD ~106 Mn (source: The Guardian) into the Melania movie, and their taxes were cut by USD 7.8 Bn. The Return On Investment is ~74 000 %. Not bad!

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

Thursday night, Donald Trump posted something racist enough to break through on social media—a rarity, as his offensive social media posts often go ignored these days. But the visceral, undeniable racism of this particular iteration, and the White House’s initial refusal to express any remorse, pushed it through. And at least one Republican senator expressed disapproval: Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”

The source of all this commotion was a screengrab of a video Trump posted on Truth Social depicting the heads of former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama laughing, open-mouthed, on ape bodies.

The screengrab is real, and the underlying video it comes from is stranger than one might expect. Trump posted the video on Truth Social at 8:44 p.m. on Thursday, and it’s actually largely about election fraud, taking you through baseless and frankly dull conspiracy theory material. But at the end, for about two seconds, it flashes to a bright jungle scene, featuring the laughing Obamas, to the tune of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The last two seconds appeared to be clipped into the video for shock humor, meant to throw a laugh in for the racists who had made it all the way through. There is no mitigating “context” here. With or without the election-fraud part, it was the Black president and first lady, depicted as apes, in one of the oldest and most dehumanizing racist tropes in history.

At first, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to defend the post as being “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King.” She added: “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

And, sure, the original video that those bizarre last seconds were taken from does indeed show Trump as a lion and Democrats as figures that could conceivably be thought of as Lion King characters—Hillary Clinton as Pumbaa, Hakeem Jeffries as Timon—bowing to him. But there are no ape characters in the Lion King. The video is generated by A.I., and is not in the animated style of the 1993 animated film but is instead standard A.I. slop. Perhaps the A.I. added in the additional characters to muddle the racism of depicting the Obamas as apes, but the fact remains that it opens with the scene of the Obamas, and lingers on it longer than the others.

And the creator of the video is not known for his delicacy or tact. Per the watermark and his own claims on X, the creator, who has Pepe the Frog for an avatar, is the same internet user behind the infamous October slop video of Trump dumping sewage onto protesters from a fighter jet. That video shocked people for its raw animosity toward legal protesters practicing their First Amendment rights, as well as for the profoundly juvenile behavior from a sitting president. If you scroll through the creator’s more recent material, it appears he pretty much exclusively makes similarly mindless, low-quality slop content with obvious MAGA messages. Other videos have included Tom Homan as a Jedi fighting protesters in Minneapolis; Don Lemon being arrested and twerking in prison; and Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, being hit with a car and thrown, cartoonishly, into the air.

Even if the original video had no racist intent, which it does, defending the original video makes no sense: Trump didn’t post the original video. He posted a two-second clip of the Obamas as apes. The message is clear.

The one valid defense would be one of ignorance. We can’t know exactly how Trump encountered this video. It’s unclear if Trump watched the entire clip, meaning maybe he didn’t see those two seconds at the end. The White House claimed it was a staffer who actually posted it. But given the highly nonstrategic style of the account’s posting that evening—another post was of an inoffensive TikTok featuring a dog eager to be fed whipped cream, classic Trump stuff—it seems a strange kind of post for a staffer.

Much more crucially, the White House left the video up once they learned of the racist section. Trump did not apologize. The White House did eventually take it down, but only after it had been up for 12 hours.

Trump has done and said many other aggressively anti-Black things in his years in the public eye; this video is not the worst. But it still says something profound about the president and his administration that they were made aware of thoroughly ugly racism coming from the president’s own messages and chose not to apologize to Black Americans or correct the error, but instead to turn against the public.

Amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s assault on Minnesota’s immigrant communities, another abuse has drawn less attention: a brazen disregard for judicial limits on his deportation campaign. The courts have determined that in January alone the administration violated at least 96 orders in 74 cases challenging the unlawful detention of immigrants in Minneapolis. The Justice Department has failed to meet its most basic obligations in many of these cases, due to an apparent combination of malice, incompetence, and institutional depletion. Further evidence of its unraveling came on Tuesday, when Julie Le, a government attorney, told Judge Jerry Blackwell, in open court: “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.” Of the backlog in Minneapolis, Le then told Blackwell: “What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Le’s shocking courtroom breakdown and what it reveals about the DOJ’s broader meltdown under Trump’s impossible demands. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Is this the clearest sign yet that for all of its tough talk about going to “war” with “rogue judges,” the DOJ under Trump is in full-on dumpster-fire crisis mode?

Mark Joseph Stern: It’s a sign that the Justice Department is actively collapsing. And it’s important to understand the background here. Blackwell had ordered Le to explain why the government failed to comply with his order demanding the release of a detained immigrant, as well as why she shouldn’t be personally held in contempt for defying that order. Her response was that she had been given an impossible task. It turned out that the Trump administration had assigned her to the U.S. attorney’s office to handle 88 immigration cases in under a month, a crushing load. That overwhelming surge of immigration cases is happening all over the country, but it’s especially acute in Minneapolis because of the ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities there.

But this is a problem entirely of the administration’s own making. Back in July, the government unilaterally reinterpreted federal immigration law to require the detention of any immigrant who was never legally admitted into the country, rather than allowing them to be released and given a bond hearing. So even if they have lawful presence today, they must be detained indefinitely. As our friend Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, courts have overwhelmingly rejected that reinterpretation: More than 350 decisions by 160 different judges in about 50 different courts have all found that that interpretation is obviously wrong. But because the Supreme Court took away universal injunctions in the birthright citizenship case in its most recent term, no single court can block the government from enforcing this position nationwide, so it keeps trying, over and over again.

That means the government is illegally detaining thousands of immigrants based on an egregious misreading of the law. Those immigrants are flooding the courts with habeas petitions for release. There were 581 habeas cases in Minnesota in January alone—an exponential increase of unmanageable proportions. The courts are overwhelmingly granting these petitions, but then the immigrants are not being released, because the DOJ doesn’t have enough lawyers on hand to process all of the rulings and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually releasing people. So that is the background that led this attorney, Le, to have a breakdown in court and say: I am unable to do the job that has been asked of me.

I want to flag that this isn’t a factual dispute. It’s not a legal dispute. It’s not a pound-on-the-table dispute. It’s a decision by the Justice Department to not have enough lawyers, and to make the system collapse under the weight of indifference and apathy. Since Trump’s second inauguration, you and I have talked a lot about judges who are mad, frustrated, and venting at Trump lawyers. This is something different. It’s scaled up massively. This is an admonition from a judge saying that the entire system of justice cannot be sustained this way, and he is watching it veer off the rails.

You see that in something else Blackwell said on Tuesday: “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.” He’s saying the government cannot create a crisis by detaining way too many immigrants illegally, then claim that it is too overwhelmed to comply with orders releasing those immigrants. That is such a vital point for a judge to make when we know that the Trump administration’s strategy is always Flood the zone. Shock and awe. Inundate the opposition with an endless blitz. And in a very real sense here, the opposition is the judiciary. It’s judges like Blackwell who are willing to stand up and say: This is illegal. You are not allowed to do this.

This is the same DOJ that’s out there on X, advertising for lawyers. Chad Mizelle, former DOJ chief of staff, literally tweeted last month: “If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me.” This isn’t freaking Dairy Queen! But one way to destroy an institution from within is to create a crisis, right? They created a crisis with the immigration sweeps. Then they created a double crisis by saying, “Well, Justice Department lawyers just can’t handle all the work.” It’s a way of signaling that the whole institution is broken.

And that’s the point. If it’s understood that DOJ lawyers suck and there’s nothing a judge can do to enforce his will, the takeaway for the public is: I guess the justice system doesn’t matter. I guess the Constitution doesn’t matter. So Julie Le freaking out in open court doesn’t get us where we need to go. We need to take the next step, which is to say that they are breaking systems and exulting in it. And that’s the part that we are not reckoning with.

I agree. These assistant U.S. attorney positions used to be super prestigious and competitive. They were a launchpad to an elite career in the law. Now Trump officials are basically pleading with people to apply for them by DM on Elon Musk’s Nazi-hangout site. There has been a mass exodus from the Justice Department—thousands of attorneys have fled since Trump returned to office. And of course the White House has purged almost every lawyer who worked on Jan. 6 cases on top of that. And now the administration can’t fill these positions. But this was the inevitable consequence of Trump’s abolishing the traditional independence of the DOJ. The department now works directly for him, including the prosecution of his political adversaries.

On top of that, the attorneys who remain in their positions have to defend these unlawful detentions, racist arrests, and other unconstitutional behavior. They’re being pulled off actual criminal cases to prosecute immigrants instead. Real violent crimes are going unprosecuted so that the deportation machine can be fed. It would take an army of immigration lawyers to handle all of this work that the DOJ has now created for itself. And nobody with a conscience wants to do this stuff. I want to quote another thing Le said in the courtroom, after Blackwell asked her about the government snatching people up in Minnesota, flying them to a detention center across the country, then not bringing them back for hearings. Le said: “I share the same concern with you, Your Honor. I am not white, as you can see, and my family’s at risk as any other people that might get picked up too. So I share the same concern, and I took that concern to heart.”

Here is a lawyer saying: Wait, what am I doing here? Why am I defending these racist policies? I shouldn’t be here either. My own family is at risk because of the policies that I’m defending. When that kind of breakdown of the system is happening in open court, of course there aren’t enough lawyers to do all of this work, because only the most racist, nativist freaks will remain. And there aren’t enough good lawyers who are also racist freaks to carry all of the weight that the DOJ is putting on itself.

To that end, we should note that Le has reportedly been removed from her post. But I think that the point we’re both trying to make is that we learned this lesson from Elon Musk, right? The easiest way to decimate government functioning is to decimate government itself. And so this is an act of contempt, but it’s also an act of power. It’s saying: You can’t make me, and I don’t care.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A growing body of research continues to show that older workers are generally more productive than younger employees.

Annie Coleman, founder of consultancy RealiseLongevity, analyzed the data and highlighted a 2025 study finding peak performance occurs between the ages of 55-60.

Writing in the Stanford Center on Longevity blog, she cited research examining 16 cognitive markers that confirm that although processing speed declines after early adulthood, other dimensions improve, and overall cognition peaks near retirement age.

Studies from the past 15 years show that some qualities like vigilance may worsen with age alongside processing speed, but others improve, including the ability to avoid distractions and accumulated knowledge.

These factors matter more as AI starts to eliminate jobs for grads and entry-level candidates, increasing the value of experienced workers who can mentor other employees.

A 2022 meta-analysis concluded that professional teams tend to function better when they have company veterans among them, as did Bank of America&#39;s findings [PDF] two years later.

Likewise, a Boston Consulting Group study in 2022 showed age-diverse teams outperformed homogeneous ones, with the best results coming when older workers&#39; judgment combined with younger employees&#39; digital skills.

So, in a working world that seemingly values youthful forward thinkers over experience – illustrated by the various age discrimination lawsuits across the tech industry – the current data shows organizations should be doing everything they can to keep their older staffers.

&quot;In meeting their responsibility for long-term risk and growth, companies should begin with clarity. Map the age profile of the workforce by role and seniority,&quot; Coleman wrote. &quot;Identify where people in their fifties and early sixties are exiting, and whether those exits reflect performance or design. Treat age as a strategic variable in the same way firms now treat gender, skills, or succession risk.

&quot;Build roles and career paths that assume longer working lives. Invest in mid- and late-career reskilling, not as remediation but as renewal. Structure intergenerational teams deliberately, so experience and speed compound rather than collide. Align product, service, and brand strategy with the realities of an aging, wealthier customer base.

&quot;None of this is about altruism. It is about reclaiming value currently being left on the table.&quot; ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/07/openreach_ptsn_hikes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Openreach is warning British businesses that the old phone network shuts down in less than a year - with half a million commercial lines still unmigrated.

BT Group&#39;s infrastructure arm is switching to an all-digital, IP-based service over fiber. To speed migration, it&#39;s hiking charges on legacy products.

Deadlines for the cutoff have slipped several times, but the telecoms giant is now bent on finally burying the copper-based public switched telephone network (PSTN) by January 31, 2027, and Openreach is already working to kill off any services that use it.

Those products come under the umbrella term of Wholesale Line Rental (WLR), and Openreach stopped selling them nationwide in 2023 to prepare the way.

Openreach claims all technical barriers to migration – including protections for vulnerable telecare users – are resolved and the deadline is &quot;locked in,&quot; so BT customers need to make sure they are ready.

Biz customers are being offered special pricing on migrations to SOGEA (Single Order Generic Ethernet Access – basically broadband without a phone service). And to reinforce the message, Openreach is about to start upping charges to service providers and companies still operating legacy business lines. From April 1, prices will rise 20 percent. Come July 1, they will go up a further 40 percent.

From October 1, there will be another 40 percent hike, meaning that any businesses still holding out will then pay double the rental cost for their legacy lines compared to last year.

This will be your final wake-up call before PSTN is terminated in January. Any customer that hasn&#39;t made the switch by then will lose service altogether.

&quot;The PSTN analog network is obsolete, becoming harder to maintain and significantly more expensive to run,&quot; claimed Openreach Director of All-IP James Lilley.

&quot;We are passing those costs on to providers who continue to sell legacy products. If your business is still on this copper service, you will start to pay a premium for a service that will be switched off,&quot; he added.

&quot;Most major communications providers moved their customers to digital long ago. If your provider hasn&#39;t contacted you, you need to ask why.&quot;

Lilley claimed Openreach spent the last year ensuring telecare customers can be switcherd via a &quot;Prove Telecare&quot; service. This was one of the reasons for delays to the switch-off date.

Openreach says it is trying to ensure service providers can migrate vulnerable customers using fixed-line telecare devices, such as health-related alarms, to new digital or IP voice services.

Yet some domestic customers, especially older citizens, do not have broadband and don&#39;t want it. The Register was previously assured these users will not be switched to a digital line &quot;until they are able to.&quot;

This involves a pre-digital phone line (PDPL) service where equipment is installed in the local telephone exchange to allow them to continue to use their old phone line as before.

This is only intended to provide &quot;interim connectivity&quot; until sometime around 2030, when customers will be required to move over to Digital Voice or an alternative.

Openreach told us there are several possibilities for consumers without broadband. If there is fiber available to the property, customers will likely be migrated to SOGEA, and given a router to plug their phone into.

If fiber isn’t available, they will likely be switched to SOTAP for Analogue (Single Order Transitional Access Product), a digital service that works in the exchange and emulates a PSTN line (see PDPL above).

If a customer does nothing, Openreach says they will most likely end up on its Emergency Voice Access (EVAC), a &quot;no frills&quot; version of SOTAP.

Customers are advised to contact their service provider to ensure they continue to receive their phone service. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first rule of AI-generated job loss is you don&#39;t talk about AI-generated job loss ... if you&#39;re the company that caused it. Higgsfield.ai, a startup offering AI video creation tools, recently generated outrage when it claimed it had caused artists to hit the unemployment line.

Earlier this week, the company bragged on X that its AI motion design tool put an end to more than 20 creative jobs.

The artists using its services – well aware of AI&#39;s impact on the creative market and perhaps discomfitted by their complicity for using these tools – were not amused and the ensuing backlash on social media led to the post&#39;s removal.

&quot;Seems like Higgsfield found out today that there are lines they just shouldn&#39;t cross in their marketing,&quot; wrote Aharon Rabinowitz, CEO of Motion Management, in a social media post. &quot;Celebrating the end of artists&#39; careers (even when their motion design tools are not actually good enough to render anyone unemployed) is just super dumb and shortsighted.&quot;

The company&#39;s marketing claims and the services it actually provides have been a matter of contention for several months. Online critics have accused the company of:

As one online critic put it, &quot;Higgsfield AI: A Company Built on Rage Bait Content, Stolen Likenesses, and Sexual Exploitation.&quot; Another has accused Higgsfield of commissioning customers to create marketing material using unlicensed intellectual property, to shift liability for potential infringement claims.

Higgsfield did not respond to requests for comment. A message to the company&#39;s email address for the press, cited in prior fundraising news, bounced. A message to the company&#39;s support email address said our inquiry had been forwarded to a human agent, but no one has followed up.

The Register also asked Menlo Ventures, one of the companies funding Higgsfield, to comment. A spokesperson for the VC firm did not comment as asked but provided a media contact who has yet to respond.

Ian Hudson, a UK-based software tester and video maker, spoke to The Register in a phone interview about the backlash against Higgsfield.

&quot;The problem seems to be that really they aren&#39;t providing much of a service themselves and it appears that a lot of the website really is just a wrapper for other services,&quot; Hudson explained. &quot;So it&#39;s doing API calls off to Google for Nano Banana and it&#39;s using a service called Kling for the video.&quot;

Hudson said that he became aware of the service in January because of the company&#39;s intensive marketing efforts. Higgsfield, he said, has been making promises about unlimited usage of services like Google Nano Banana and Kling.

&quot;But there&#39;s no explanation so you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on,&quot; he said. &quot;Either something&#39;s unlimited or it&#39;s not, but it turns out it&#39;s not unlimited. Really you&#39;re not getting anything unlimited, you&#39;re getting a quick trial of it. And then it turns out that&#39;s got terms and conditions [that say] if you do a lot of use of it, we&#39;ll ban you.&quot;

Hudson said Higgsfield puts user prompts in a queue that gets delayed for an arbitrary amount of time before being routed to the underlying third-party AI service.

&quot;So it appears to be unlimited, but then it&#39;s not because it&#39;s throttling things for so long to get a result back that you get a fraction of what you could get if you went to, say, Google Gemini directly,&quot; he explained. &quot;So it&#39;s not really a service that is fit for purpose.&quot;

Hudson also criticized the company for its approach to marketing, which he said involved making controversial posts to generate attention and drama, and then deleting the posts to hide the evidence.

And he took issue with the limitations imposed on refunds. Higgsfield, he said, refuses to give refunds if you&#39;ve used their services.

&quot;So essentially nobody can get a refund because the only way you can get a refund is if you don&#39;t touch the bleeding thing and work out if it actually works,&quot; he said, &quot;which as you can appreciate, that&#39;s just fundamentally unfair. And this is where the credit card companies are falling down because the credit card companies say, &#39;oh well we&#39;ve looked at terms and conditions and they&#39;re adhering to terms and conditions.&#39;&quot;

These sorts of complaints are rife on social media and in the company&#39;s Discord channel. A post on Thursday states, &quot;...it is evident that your marketing is deceptive and your service is non-functional.&quot;

The post goes on to complain about service unavailability, unacceptable latency (4-10 hours of wait time for a five-minute video), censorship errors, and false marketing.

Hudson took issue with the company&#39;s engagement-bait marketing strategy.

&quot;A lot of people go &#39;isn&#39;t it awesome that they&#39;re doing that!&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;No it&#39;s not. It&#39;s childish and it&#39;s unprofessional. But what they&#39;ve done in the last few days, it said something like, &#39;Our product&#39;s so great we&#39;ve been able to sack off twenty creators.&#39; Something along those lines. And because their entire community is creators, a lot of them got upset.&quot;

Robert Scoble, an internet influencer since before that was really a term, claimed in a social media post that he spoke with an individual behind the Higgsfield influencer network last week.

&quot;This guy is trying to capture attention in a world where none of us have any,&quot; he mused.

To quote Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray, &quot;There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot;

Bankruptcy, moral or financial, is pretty bad too. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/darpa_seeking_physicsdefying_photonic_computers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no lightweight matter. DARPA is putting about $35 million in total funding on the table in the hope that it will spur researchers to work around fundamental physical constraints and build much larger-scale photonic circuits that do more of the computing with light, not electronics.

A recent solicitation from the Department of Defense&#39;s research arm - the Photonic Integrated Circuit Architectures for Scalable System Objectives (PICASSO) - aims to scale photonics beyond today’s narrow demonstrations. Citing the need for more capable photonic systems, including those relevant to artificial intelligence workloads, DARPA is calling on researchers to submit proposals showing how circuit-level design can overcome the fundamental limitations that constrain current photonic computing approaches, using today’s photonic components rather than waiting for new ones to be invented.

For those unfamiliar with photonic computing, it&#39;s the use of light instead of electrons to process and transmit data. If that sounds far-fetched, it&#39;s not, as DARPA points out - there are already photonic circuits around today, albeit in limited form.

Using light to process data signals has advantages that are ideal for heavy workloads like AI due to greater bandwidth, less latency, and improved energy efficiency. Unfortunately, as DARPA points out, &quot;systems incorporating photonic circuits struggle to show significant system-level performance advantages over electronic systems.&quot;

The current generation of photonic circuits is limited in depth, which restricts their ability to do much beyond single linear mathematical operations. Individual photonic circuits included in larger systems also have to convert optical signals to electronic ones in order to hand them off to other components, essentially eliminating the advantage of nanosecond latency due to the millisecond latency of electronic circuits, which DARPA notes is a 106 performance degradation.

So, what&#39;s holding photonic circuits back aside from, according to DARPA, an industry focus on component-level research? Why, just physics of course.

&quot;The primary limitation to further scaling of circuit size and functionality is rooted in the fundamental properties of signaling with light,&quot; DARPA noted. Cool - easy fix, provided researchers can address the two fundamental technical challenges the research organization points out.

First there&#39;s signal degradation. Unlike metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits, which regenerate signals and filter out noise, photonic circuits have a fundamental issue of optical attenuation and noise that can&#39;t be amplified out, as any attempt to amplify optical signals also amplifies the noise.

Second, there&#39;s the issue of spurious wave interference, which leads to scattering, coupling, mode leakage, back reflections, and unwanted resonance. &quot;Over many components, control of these errors becomes unpredictable, especially when combined with manufacturing variability and thermal and environmental instabilities,&quot; DARPA explained.

Overcoming those limitations, as mentioned above, has traditionally resulted in photonic circuits being interfaced with electronic ones, and DARPA doesn&#39;t want that.

&quot;Heavy usage of electronics prevents system-level gains in latency, efficiency, and bandwidth offered natively by photonics,&quot; the agency said.

Here&#39;s where PICASSO comes in: What DARPA wants from its chosen participants is, like resolving the limitations imposed by the physics of light, simple: Just make better circuits so those two technical challenges aren&#39;t an issue anymore.

&quot;Drawing inspiration from modern electronics, in which clever circuit design overcomes the limitations of individual transistors, the program will foster innovative circuit-level strategies to achieve unprecedented system performance and stability,&quot; DARPA said. &quot;PICASSO confronts these challenges by embracing a new paradigm: creating tomorrow&#39;s photonic circuits using today&#39;s components.&quot;

DARPA isn&#39;t just soliciting ideas, either. By the time PICASSO phase 1 wraps up, 18 months after it kicks off in July, DARPA wants a &quot;demonstration of predictable performance of photonic circuits,&quot; and by the end of phase 2 (an additional 18 month period), it expects &quot;generalized circuit functionality&quot; to be demonstrated.

It also expects all that within a total program budget of about $35 million, spread across multiple awards. Proposals are due by March 6 - good luck. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four tech megacorps intend to collectively fork out roughly $635 billion this year on capex, much of it for datacenters and AI infrastructure – more than the entire output of Israel&#39;s economy and well beyond all global cloud infrastructure services revenue generated last year.

The tech titans are all trying to outdo each other by spending eye-watering amounts on capex, the majority of which will go on AI and cloud expansion, but the big four – AWS, Microsoft, Google and Meta – are investing at a different scale.

Amazon says it expects to spend $200 billion in 2026, with most of that headed to AWS. Google is aiming to pump $180 billion into building and equipping datacenters, while Meta expects capex in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion, and Microsoft is running at a pace that implies around $120 billion a year in spending.

That adds up to $635 billion, more than the $610 billion that represented Israel&#39;s entire gross domestic product during 2025, and approaching that of Sweden at $662 billion, according to figures from the IMF.

These extraordinary sums show how far the industry leaders are willing to go to gain some kind of advantage in the AI race, even though returns on all the spending have so far failed to live up to expectations, and investors are reportedly getting restless. Microsoft&#39;s share price fell about 10 percent after its recent results were announced, for example, due to investors expecting a bigger payoff.

The wider cost for users? The massive splurge on infrastructure is driving shortages of components like memory as manufacturers prioritize chip production that cashes in on the lucrative datacenter market, rather than those for everyday PCs and phones.

The huge capex pledges also add up to more than total cloud infrastructure services revenue in 2025. According to the latest figures from Synergy Research Group, the revenues reached $419 billion last year.

This is despite the cloud market itself continuing to grow at an impressive pace, running at about 30 percent year-on-year and marking a ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

&quot;GenAI has simply put the cloud market into overdrive,&quot; said Synergy Research Group chief analyst John Dinsdale. &quot;AI-specific services account for much of the growth since 2022, but AI technology has also enhanced the broader portfolio of cloud services, driving revenue growth across the board. The leading cloud providers have all seen their revenue growth rates jump.&quot;

The big three clouds continue to dominate with Synergy putting their shares of the worldwide market in Q4 2025 at 28 percent for Amazon (AWS), 21 percent for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud at 14 percent.

Among the tier-two cloud providers, those with the highest growth rates include CoreWeave, Oracle, Crusoe, and Nebius, all providers of AI infrastructure services. In particular, CoreWeave is now generating more than $1.5 billion in quarterly cloud revenue and has joined the top ten cloud providers, Synergy says. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Legacy image-sharing website Flickr suffered a data breach, according to customers emails seen by The Register.

The hack transpired on February 5, an email to customers stated, and the company said it &quot;shut down access to the affected system within hours of learning about it.&quot;

The security issue stemmed from a third-party email service provider, the identity of which was not specified.

In the email, Flickr said it disabled access to the affected system and removed all links to the vulnerable endpoint before notifying its email provider and demanding an investigation into the incident.

&quot;We are conducting a thorough review and strengthening our security practices with third-party providers,&quot; Flickr&#39;s email stated. &quot;We notified the relevant data protection authorities.&quot;

As for the all-important &#39;what data was taken&#39; question, it&#39;s the usual personally identifiable information (PII) and a few other less-expected markers.

Thge message to custokers states that names, email addresses, usernames, account types, IP addresses and general locations, and Flickr activity were potentially accessed by hackers. What data is exposed, as always, depends on each given account. It won&#39;t be the same for everyone.

The Register asked the SmugMug-owned company for more information, including how many of its users were affected.

Since Flickr included links to both European and US data protection authorities in its email, potentially indicating the impact was felt in multiple regions. Flickr operates in 190 countries.

As for its number of active users, Flickr&#39;s advertising arm says 35 million per month are contributing to the site, generating 800 million page views. Approximately 228,000 of these were in Europe, a Digital Services Act publication confirmed.

The company&#39;s email warned users to beware of phishing emails referencing their account and reminded them that the real Flickr would never ask for things like passwords via email.

It also suggested users review their account settings for any unexpected findings, and if they use the same password for Flickr as they do for other services, to consider changing it.

Flickr&#39;s email said no password or financial information was affected, though.

&quot;We sincerely apologize for this incident and for the concern it may cause,&quot; the company said in the email.

&quot;We take the privacy and security of your data extremely seriously, and we are taking immediate action to prevent any similar issues by conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our system architecture, and further enhancing our monitoring of third-party service providers.&quot; ®

Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 115, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, go Seahawks I guess, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)

This week, I’ve been reading about The Washington Post and the Murdochs and Polymarket and whatever a “Soho House for creators” is, watching Independence Day for the first time and Jurassic Park for roughly the 50th, bailing on everything for the next few weeks so I can watch the Olympics full-time, loving the timeline-task-manager look of Paso, learning more about Furby than I ever expected for the upcoming season of Version History, and trying to teach Claude how to clean up my email inbox.

I also have for you the best way to watch sports for the next few weeks, a great update to a great bookmarking app, a bunch of fun nostalgia-bait things, and much more. Also, don’t forget to send me your favorite non-Big Tech apps! I’ve heard from a ton of you about the email apps, productivity tools, office suites, and messaging platforms you’ve switched to, and I want to hear more. Lots more coming on that next week. For now, let’s dive in.

(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you watching / playing / reading / listening to / hacking with OpenClaw this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)

A couple of weeks ago, I read an essay I haven’t stopped thinking about since. It’s called “Phantom Obligation,” and starts with a really fun question: Why do RSS readers look like email clients? The essay, by Terry Godier, is a fascinating argument about how we structure and consume information, why decades-old ideas about interfaces need to be rethought, and why we need to run from the feeling that inboxes provide.

Terry’s essay went kind of viral, especially when it turned out he was building an app called Current he hoped might be a better take on the medium. (Not to brag, but he promised to get me in the TestFlight.) This week, he also wrote a thoughtful essay about the state of podcasts, and it turns out has some thoughts there too. I like the way he thinks about products in general, so I asked him to share his homescreen to get a sense of what else he likes.

Here’s Terry’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:

The wallpaper: On the lockscreen: just a sweet, impossible, obviously-not-real outer space image of the moon as seen from a mountain range with no atmosphere whatsoever. On the homescreen: nothing, nada. Just solid black, which is either every color combined or no colors at all. I’m not confident which it is, but it’s probably one of them.

The apps: Find My, Fastmail, Fantastical, ChatGPT, Claude, Carrot Weather, Photos, Things, Reddit, Instagram, Margin, Current, Ivory, Are.na, Bear, Recollect, Phone, Messages, Safari.

I have a home folder on the top left which has all of my various home automation apps (I’m too lazy to complete my HomeAssistant rig). Then Find My, because my kids love to see where Mom is and how long it’ll be before she gets home. Fastmail, which is my email provider; Fantastical, which I use because it’s nice to be able to put in calendar notifications with natural language and my house runs on calendar invites.

The media folder contains things like Nugs (sweet streaming concert videos), Music, Patreon, etc. There’s also my two handy robot friends ChatGPT and Claude… and Carrot Weather, which is pretty much a robot, actually, so I guess I have three robot friends. And two notes apps, Bear (a classic) and Recollect.fyi, which is something my friend Jon made that I adore (it’s a PWA!)

I also asked Terry to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:

Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.

“I took an old mini desktop PC and threw Batocera on it so that I can play emulated games with a nice front end, and earn RetroAchievements while playing some old classics!” — Chris

“Timothy Zahn’s Heir to the Empire trilogy, which is regarded as the best series of Star Wars books. Absolutely loved it, and highly recommend it to people who appreciate the franchise, specifically the Audible audiobooks that are complete with voice acting, sound effects, and a John Williams soundtrack!” — Noah

“I started using this app called Fitera to track my workouts. If you were using Apple Notes to track workouts and then importing them to Microsoft Excel manually at home to visualize, then this solves that (very niche, albeit real) problem. Oh and the app design is gorgeous and reminds me a lot of FoodNoms.” — Athan

“​​Watching the new series of Um, Actually on Dropout, as well as rewatching some of my other Dropout top shows (Game Changer, VIP, etc.). Did I mention how much I love Dropout?” — Andrew

“Switching to Linux Mint has removed all the Windows bloat and breathed new life into my eight-year-old laptop; it’s so much faster and pleasant to use now (and no start menu ads!).” — Sleepy

“I’d like to recommend the podcast / YouTube channel BS Phototime. It features two accomplished and intelligent photographers, Sissi Lu and Birgit Buchart. With only three episodes to date, they’re still finding their footing, but the decidedly less gear-focused / specs-driven conversations that focus more on the art of photography is refreshing.” — Mark

“Watching Wonder Man! It feels like the LA LA Land of Marvel” — Jeremy

“I’m reading Chronicles of a Liquid Society, the last book from Umberto Eco. A collection of his editorials that read like blog posts. They range from 2000 onward, so some of the topics are now quaint (like the implausible idea in 2004 that every kid has a computer in class).” — Rich

Last week, thanks to Chris Mims, I spent some time on the BBC Archive’s YouTube channel. This evidently convinced the YouTube algorithm that all I want is really old TV segments — and honestly, it was correct.

When I haven’t been enjoying a treasure trove of well-curated clips from the old Top Gear crew, I’ve been watching a ton of old news clips from the early days of personal computing and the internet. Nearly all of them pre-date anything I remember, and it has been both extremely cool and extremely helpful to go back to a time when PCs were way too difficult for even simple tasks, when Elon Musk was just a startup guy and Jeff Bezos was just a bookseller, and when satellite navigation was the most sci-fi thing to ever happen to your car.

In addition to all the “ahh, simpler times” vibes I get from these videos, they’re a handy reminder of how exciting new tech can really be — and how much more we should think about the implications before these nifty new things get too big. New tech can be great! We just have to make it that way.

A rumored update would open the door for voice-controlled third-party AI apps.

CarPlay users could soon be able to use their chatbot of choice instead of Siri. As Bloomberg reports, Apple is working to add support for CarPlay voice control apps from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. Previously, users who wanted to access third-party chatbots in the car would need to go through their iPhone, but soon they may be able to talk with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini directly in CarPlay.

However, Apple reportedly “won’t let users replace the Siri button on CarPlay or the wake word that summons the service.” So, users will need to manually open their preferred chatbot’s app. Developers will be able to set their apps to automatically start voice mode whenever they’re opened, though, which could help streamline the experience.

According to Bloomberg, the addition of third-party chatbots in CarPlay could roll out “within the coming months,” but hasn’t been officially announced yet. The rumored update follows Apple’s announcement last month that Google Gemini will power an updated version of Siri, which is slated to arrive sometime this year.

            <div id="article-text">I spoke to two Trump Mobile executives for an exclusive first look at what they say is the T1 Phone.

I spoke to two Trump Mobile executives for an exclusive first look at what they say is the T1 Phone.

Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts. This time, surprisingly, we received a response — and an interview.

The Trump phone is real — maybe, sort of, soon? — and I’ve seen it. Not in the flesh, but during an hourlong video call with two Trump Mobile executives who showed me a phone, and told me more about why it was delayed, when it might actually reach buyers, and why its spec sheet has changed again and again.

I spoke to Don Hendrickson — yes, the one who had seemingly ghosted me last time — and Eric Thomas, two of the three executives that run Trump Mobile. The T1 Phone that Thomas shows me over Google Meet isn’t a final production model, but apparently it’s close. The T1 logo — seen since the first renders of the phone — will apparently be dropped before launch, though the American flag at the bottom will remain, as will the signature gold finish.

It’s clear from a glance that this isn’t the same phone the company teased eight months ago. The iPhone-esque camera triangle has been replaced by three lenses laid out vertically in a black, oval island with “Trump Mobile” written alongside. Look closer and you’ll see those lenses are unevenly spaced.

The phone is different in a few other ways from both the version that was announced in June 2025 and the altered spec sheet that appeared on the Trump Mobile website a couple of weeks later. It looks larger, with the “waterfall” display (curved screens are back, baby) appearing closer to the 6.78-inch screen originally promised than the 6.25-inch model that appeared a little later.

It will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 series chipset, usually used in upper-midrange devices, and include a 5,000mAh battery, 512GB of storage, and support for up to 1TB microSD cards. I don’t know the full camera spec just yet, but I was told that both the selfie camera and the main rear camera are using 50-megapixel sensors, and a glimpse of the camera UI suggests the inclusion of an ultrawide lens and perhaps a telephoto, neither of which had been listed before.

“This actual phone does spec with the top-of-the-line phones in the market this year,” Thomas says, later claiming it will be comparable to “any phone that’s over $1,000.” I’m not entirely sure that’s true, given you can find comparable specs, even the 50-megapixel selfie camera, in the OnePlus Nord 5, which ships with 512GB storage in the UK for £499 — around $679. Much will depend on camera performance and whether it includes flagship touches like waterproofing or wireless charging, which I don’t yet know. But it is true that some specs — the selfie camera resolution, the storage capacity, the ultrawide lens — are improved from the T1 Phone we saw (or didn’t) at launch.

To reflect that alleged improvement in quality, a price hike is coming. Hendrickson is quick to emphasize that everyone who placed a $100 deposit already (he wouldn’t tell me how many had done so) will still pay $499 total, but they’re now calling that an “introductory price.” Later buyers will pay more, though “less than $1,000” is all the pair would confirm, with the final price apparently still to be decided.

So why all the changes? To hear Thomas and Hendrickson put it, there was so much interest in the T1 Phone that it only felt right to make the phone better by jumping forward a little in their long-term plans. “Let’s skip our first initial entry-level phone that we were going to kind of introduce and be quick to the market,” Thomas says of the company’s thinking following the early media attention. “Let’s take our time and do what we were planning to be the next step.”

The pair suggest the decision to re-spec the phone is behind some, though not all, of its delays — the T1 Phone is now six months late to launch. Still, they say it’s coming soon. The phone has apparently cleared FCC certification (itself supposedly slowed by the government shutdown) and is now awaiting certification with T-Mobile, expected to complete sometime in mid-March. After that, Thomas says the company will be ready to ship phones to early buyers, though he’s hesitant to commit to an exact date. For a phone that was first promised for August or September, then by the end of 2025, and still only says “later this year” on the official website, I would take any launch timeline with a fistful of salt.

Still, it sounds like we’ll see more soon regardless. The two executives promise that a Trump Mobile “relaunch” is coming, and that within “the next couple of weeks” the website will be updated with images of the final phone, along with its spec sheet. Our long wait is nearly over.

Of course, there’s one thing the T1 Phone won’t be: made in the USA. Instead, the handsets go through “final assembly” in Miami, though Thomas is careful not to say too much about what that means. It’s more than “slapping a cover on the phone,” and apparently involves putting together the final 10 or so pieces. The pair won’t say where the bulk of the phone is assembled prior to that, only that it’s done in a “favored nation,” which essentially seems to be a way of saying “not China.”

To call a product “made in the USA” you have to meet certain standards, laid down and enforced by the FTC. The Trump Mobile site instead currently promises that there are “American hands behind every device,” and Thomas says that the wording was chosen because they “want to be upfront and not misleading at all to people.” He admits that there “might have been something put on the website” in error at launch (in this case, a huge homepage banner that said the T1 is “MADE IN THE USA” and a press release that said it’s “proudly designed and built in the United States”), but that since then “we’ve kind of stayed away from that.”

Full assembly in the US is still what the pair call a “goal,” though, one they’re apparently working on for future phones like the T1 Ultra — yes, that’s apparently real too, though they wouldn’t tell me much more about it.

I guess we’ll have to keep waiting, but until then: The Trump phone is real (ish), I’ve seen it (sort of), and it’s finally going to launch next month (maybe).

            <div id="article-text">﻿What does the Amazon founder even get out of owning the Post?

﻿What does the Amazon founder even get out of owning the Post?

300 journalists have lost their jobs at The Washington Post. Over 300,000 readers have canceled their subscriptions. Owner Jeff Bezos, who purchased the legendary publication in 2013, has driven his reputation into the ground by using his vast empire to churn out content designed to make President Donald Trump happy: Amazon MGM Studios spent $40 million to produce a fawning documentary about Melania Trump, which premiered days before the Post sent out mass layoff notices. And yet, he’s gotten nothing out of his attempts to suck up to Donald Trump — at least, nothing that’s a net positive to his bottom line.

Which begs the cynical question: Why does he even own The Washington Post at all?

The Trump era is, after all, a cynical and transactional time. Billionaires, CEOs, and world leaders have quickly learned that sucking up to Trump will get them what they want — pardons, tariff exemption, an export control lifted, a merger deal approved, an investigation quashed. And when it comes to media companies, the Paramount-Skydance merger has set the bar for sucking up to Trump. In order for the merger to get regulatory approval, Skydance CEO David Ellison pushed CBS to settle a defamation suit filed by Trump, canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and hired Bari Weiss, a right-wing Substacker with virtually no newsroom leadership experience, as CBS News’s editor-in-chief. In short, Ellison had to commit to neutering CBS’s ability to criticize Trump. But he did get a $28 billion merger out of it.

Bezos’ media plays, on the other hand, seem self-contradictory. Financing a fawning documentary about Melania Trump does not mesh with owning a media company with a 150-year-old legacy of holding politicians accountable, especially one that famously held Trump accountable during his first administration. (If the goal was to neuter the Post too, then bafflingly, his deputy, Will Lewis, fired everyone except for those on the political desks.) Even his attempt to separate the political opinions from the Post’s journalism, an attempt to have it both ways, backfired. After he announced that the opinion page would now reflect more conservative views, reporters began leaving the Post in droves, and subscriber numbers plummeted even further. As the Post’s former editor-in-chief Marty Baron put it in a column shortly after the layoffs, it was “near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”

One could argue — as WaPo insiders have to media reporters — that the layoffs were necessary because the paper was losing money. But billionaires have plenty of face-saving ways to get an unprofitable media outlet off their hands, in a manner that does not include mass layoffs (or at least, offloads the layoffs onto its next owner). The Philadelphia Inquirer, for instance, had been donated by its billionaire owner to a nonprofit, while Facebook billionaire Chris Hughes ended up selling The New Republic to Win McCormack after his own failed attempt to reshape the 100-year-old magazine. The Post, which had grown its digital audience throughout Bezos’ ownership, would have immediately attracted buyers: last year, tech journalist Kara Swisher announced that she and several investors were prepared to purchase the Post from Bezos, but reportedly never heard back from him.

Perhaps Bezos needs to suck up to Trump to further Amazon’s interests, which would make more sense if Bezos still ran the company. Except he doesn’t. He stepped down as CEO in 2021. Amazon, whose subsidiary AWS holds the lion’s share of federal government contracts, has been able to independently suck up to Trump via donations to the White House’s new ballroom fund. (Admittedly, Bezos’ government contracts with NASA are on the table, and he was reportedly spotted hanging out with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a Blue Origin facility in Florida on the day of the Post layoffs.)

Maybe this pile of self-contradictions — or, as he once described his ownership of the Post, a “complexifier” — was inevitable when Trump came back into office and made it clear that he would punish the Big Tech entities that displeased him. But there’s no clear and logical explanation for why Bezos is going about his supplication: not one that makes financial sense, nor one that immediately furthers his own political standing with Trump, nor one that reaffirms the commitment he once made to protecting the First Amendment. And that lack of clarity only makes the Post’s decapitation even more senseless.

Epic Games says a player changed their account name to ‘littlestjeff1’ after the alias was found in the Epstein files.

Fortnite developer Epic Games says the account some people believed to be linked to Jeffrey Epstein is a “ruse.” In a reply on X, the developer writes, “an existing Fortnite account owner changed their username” to “littlestjeff1,” an alias spotted in several emailed receipts from YouTube in the Epstein files.

The email suggests that “littlestjeff1” may have been connected to Epstein’s YouTube account, prompting online sleuths to search for the username on other platforms. Users later uncovered a “littlestjeff1” account on Fortnite, along with a 2019 email that mentions purchasing VBucks in Fortnite — though the sender and recipient are redacted. Online player databases showed that the “littlestjeff1” account has been active on Fortnite, fueling conspiracy theories that Epstein is still alive.

But Epic Games has since debunked these claims, saying that a Fortnite player changed their name “following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube.” The company adds that the Fortnite trackers, where people uncovered the alias, “only display your current name, not any prior changes to it,” and that it has “no record” of Epstein’s email addresses mentioned in the files.

“Someone’s been having fun renaming their Fortnite account, but it’s recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says on X.

            <h2>Moltbook was peak AI theater</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, and since then at least three others have been born.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <h2>An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132319/experimental-surgery-colorectal-cancer-survivors-pregnant-birth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.
