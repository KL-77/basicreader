            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, is now also the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an unusual arrangement that has drawn swift criticism from researchers and public health experts.

Bhattacharya’s new role comes amid a leadership shakeup in the Department of Health and Human Services under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also marks the third leader for the beleaguered public health agency under Kennedy.

Susan Monarez, a microbiologist and long-time federal health official, held the position of acting director before becoming the first Senate-confirmed CDC director at the end of July. But she was in the role just shy of a month before Kennedy ousted her for—according to Monarez—refusing to rubber-stamp changes to vaccine recommendations made by Kennedy’s hand-picked advisors, who are overwhelmingly anti-vaccine themselves.

Jim O’Neill was then named acting director. At the time, O’Neill was the deputy secretary of HHS but had previously worked as a Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur who became a close ally of Peter Thiel. As acting director of the CDC, he signed off on a dramatic overhaul of the CDC’s childhood vaccine recommendations.

Now, amid Kennedy’s shake-up, O’Neill is out of the CDC and, according to media reports, will be nominated to run the National Science Foundation, which is currently without a director or deputy director. As a health economist with a medical degree, Bhattacharya has more qualifications to temporarily run the CDC than O’Neill, but researchers and public health experts were quick to blast his apparent lack of leadership skills.

Under Bhattacharya’s watch, the NIH terminated or froze hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, according to a Senate report released earlier this month. At least 304 clinical trials were defunded. Of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers, 16 are currently without directors, an unprecedented number of vacancies.

Insiders report that, as NIH director, Bhattacharya delegates most of his responsibilities for running the $47 billion agency to two top officials. Instead of a hands-on leader, Bhattacharya has become known for his many public interviews, earning him the nickname “Podcast Jay.”

Researchers expect that Bhattacharya will perform similarly at the helm of the CDC. Jenna Norton, an NIH program officer who spoke to the Guardian in her personal capacity, commented that Bhattacharya “won’t actually run the CDC. Just as he doesn’t actually run NIH.” His role for the administration, she added, “is largely as a propagandist.”

Jeremy Berg, former director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, echoed the sentiment to the Guardian. “Now, rather than largely ignoring the actual operations of one agency, he can largely ignore the actual operations of two,” he said.

Kayla Hancock, director of Public Health Watch, a nonprofit advocacy group, went further in a public statement, saying, “Jay Bhattacharya has overseen the most chaotic and rudderless era in NIH history, and for RFK Jr. to give him even more responsibility at the CDC is malpractice against the public health.”

Like other commenters, Hancock noted his apparent lack of involvement at the NIH and put it in the context of the current state of US public health. “This is the last person who should be overseeing the CDC at a time when preventable diseases like measles are roaring back under RFK Jr.’s deadly anti-vax agenda,” she said.

It is widely expected that Bhattacharya will, like O’Neill, act as a rubber-stamp for Kennedy’s relentless anti-vaccine agenda items. When Kennedy dramatically overhauled the CDC’s childhood vaccine schedule, slashing recommended vaccinations from 17 to 11 without scientific evidence, Bhattacharya was among the officials who signed off on the unprecedented change.

Ultimately, Bhattacharya will only be in the role for a short time, at least officially. The role of CDC director became a Senate-confirmed position in 2023, and, as such, an acting director can serve only 210 days from the date the role became vacant. That deadline comes up on March 25. President Trump has not nominated anyone to fill the director role.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-bans-archive-today-after-site-executed-ddos-and-altered-web-captures/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The English-language edition of Wikipedia is blacklisting Archive.today after the controversial archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blog.

In the course of discussing whether Archive.today should be deprecated because of the DDoS, Wikipedia editors discovered that the archive site altered snapshots of webpages to insert the name of the blogger who was targeted by the DDoS. The alterations were apparently fueled by a grudge against the blogger over a post that described how the Archive.today maintainer hid their identity behind several aliases.

“There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist (or create an edit filter that blocks adding new links), and remove all links to it,” stated an update today on Wikipedia’s Archive.today discussion. “There is a strong consensus that Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack (see WP:ELNO#3). Additionally, evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”

More than 695,000 links to Archive.today are distributed across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. The archive site, which is facing an investigation in which the FBI is trying to uncover the identity of its founder, is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.

“Those in favor of maintaining the status quo rested their arguments primarily on the utility of archive.today for verifiability,” said today’s Wikipedia update. “However, an analysis of existing links has shown that most of its uses can be replaced. Several editors started to work out implementation details during this RfC [request for comment] and the community should figure out how to efficiently remove links to archive.today.”

Guidance published as a result of the decision asked editors to help remove and replace links to the following domain names used by the archive site: archive.today, archive.is, archive.ph, archive.fo, archive.li, archive.md, and archive.vn. The guidance says editors can remove Archive.today links when the original source is still online and has identical content; replace the archive link so it points to a different archive site, like the Internet Archive, Ghostarchive, or Megalodon; or “change the original source to something that doesn’t need an archive (e.g., a source that was printed on paper), or for which a link to an archive is only a matter of convenience.”

The Wikipedia guidance points out that the Internet Archive and its website, Archive.org, are “uninvolved with and entirely separate from archive.today.” The Internet Archive is a nonprofit based in the US.

As we previously reported, malicious code in Archive.today’s CAPTCHA page was used to direct a DDoS against the Gyrovague blog written by a man named Jani Patokallio. The Archive.today maintainer demanded that Patokallio take down a 2023 blog post that discussed the archive site founder’s possible identity. Patokallio wasn’t able to determine who runs Archive.today but mentioned apparent aliases such as “Denis Petrov” and “Masha Rabinovich,” and described evidence that the site is operated by someone from Russia.

When we last wrote about this topic, the Archive.today maintainer told Ars Technica that it would not provide any comment on the Wikipedia discussion unless we removed references to Patokallio’s blog, which we did not do.

Patokallio told Ars today that he is pleased by the Wikipedia community’s decision. “I’m glad the Wikipedia community has come to a clear consensus, and I hope this inspires the Wikimedia Foundation to look into creating its own archival service,” he told us.

In emails sent to Patokallio after the DDoS began, “Nora” from Archive.today threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn and to create a gay dating app with Patokallio’s name. These threats were discussed by Wikipedia editors in their deliberations over whether to blacklist Archive.today, and then editors noticed that Patokallio’s name had been inserted into some Archive.today captures of webpages.

“Honestly, I’m kind of in shock,” one editor wrote. “Just to make sure I’m understanding the implications of this: we have good reason to believe that the archive.today operator has tampered with the content of their archives, in a manner that suggests they were trying to further their position against the person they are in dispute with???”

“If this is true it essentially forces our hand, archive.today would have to go,” another editor replied. “The argument for allowing it has been verifiability, but that of course rests upon the fact the archives are accurate, and the counter to people saying the website cannot be trusted for that has been that there is no record of archived websites themselves being tampered with. If that is no longer the case then the stated reason for the website being reliable for accurate snapshots of sources would no longer be valid.”

One example discussed by Wikipedia editors involved Jani Patokallio’s name being inserted into an Archive.today capture of a blog post that was mentioned by Patokallio in his February 2026 write-up of the DDoS incident. This blog is related to the “Nora” alias used by the Archive.today maintainer, which now appears to be the name of an actual person.

“It appears increasingly likely that the identity of ‘Nora’ has been appropriated from an actual person, whose only connection to archive.today was a request to take down some content,” Patokallio wrote in an update to his blog today. “As a courtesy, I have redacted their last name from this post.”

Evidence presented in the Wikipedia discussion showed that Archive.today replaced Nora’s name with Patokallio’s name in the aforementioned blog post. The Archive.today capture has since been reverted to what appears to be the original version. In other cases, Archive.today captures included a “Comment as: Jani Patokallio” string on captures that previously had a “Comment as: Nora [last name redacted]” string.

Even if the snapshot alterations hadn’t helped convince Wikipedia’s volunteer editors to deprecate Archive.today, the Wikimedia Foundation itself might have stepped in. In its comments on the DDoS, the nonprofit that operates Wikipedia said on February 10 that it had not ruled out intervening due to “the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a long time now, PC gamers have been used to the Final Fantasy series treating their platform as somewhat secondary to the game’s core console versions. There are some signs that may be starting to change, though, as director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed that the PC is now the “lead platform” for development of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy.

In a recent interview with Automaton, Hamaguchi clarified that the team takes the relatively common practice of creating visual assets for its multiplatform games by targeting “high-end environments first,” then performing a “reduction” for less powerful platforms. These days, that means “our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation,” he said. Players have already noticed this graphical difference in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Hamaguchi said, and “our philosophy will not change for the third installment.”

While PC gaming is only “gradually expanding in Japan,” Hamaguchi said the rapid growth in international PC gamers has led the company to “develop assets with the broad PC market in mind.”

The PC versions of recent Final Fantasy VII Remake games have sold well on Steam and the Epic Games Store, he added.

It’s unclear if that means PC gamers will have to wait longer than console owners for future Final Fantasy games. The first Final Fantasy VII Remake didn’t hit PCs until 19 months after the PlayStation 4 version, and Rebirth was first available on PC 11 months after its PS5 launch. Elsewhere in the franchise, the PC versions of both Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy XV didn’t hit until over a year after their console counterparts.

Elsewhere in the interview, Hamaguchi went into some detail about what he sees as the relative deficiencies of various game consoles. Compared to a high-end PC, for instance, Hamaguchi said he considers the PS5 and PS5 Pro “mid-range platforms” that require texture sizes, mesh loads, and polygon counts that are 1.5 to 3 times lower than the PC versions. Further down the line, the Steam Deck operates “at less than half the PS5’s baseline,” Hamaguchi said.

Further considerations are necessary for other consoles. On the PS4, Switch 2, and Xbox Series S, for instance, Hamaguchi said the relative limitations of the CPU generally require limiting graphics to 30 fps (rather than the 60 fps on high-end platforms), as well as reducing the number of NPCs that can appear in a town when compared to higher-end systems. Hamaguchi also specifically called out the memory limitations on the Xbox Series S, which requires specific optimizations compared to the “ample memory” available on the Switch 2.

Development of the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is “progressing very smoothly,” Hamaguchi said, and the team is currently “almost exactly on schedule” with planned development milestones.</div>

            <h2>"Million-year-old" fossil skulls from China are far older—and not Denisovans</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/new-dates-on-chinese-fossils-raise-question-of-how-many-times-we-left-africa/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two skulls from Yunxian, in northern China, aren’t ancestors of Denisovans after all; they’re actually the oldest known Homo erectus fossils in eastern Asia.

A recent study has re-dated the skulls to about 1.77 million years old, which makes them the oldest hominin remains found so far in East Asia. Their age means that Homo erectus (an extinct common ancestor of our species, Neanderthals, and Denisovans) must have spread across the continent much earlier and much faster than we’d previously given them credit for. It also sheds new light on who was making stone tools at some even older archaeological sites in China.

Yunxian is an important—and occasionally contentious—archaeological site on the banks of central China’s Han River. Along with hundreds of stone tools and animal bones, the layers of river sediment have yielded three nearly complete hominin skulls (only two of which have been described in a publication so far). Shantou University paleoanthropologist Hua Tu and his colleagues measured the ratio of two isotopes, aluminum-26 and beryllium-10, in grains of quartz from the sediment layer that once held the skulls. The results suggest that Homo erectus lived and died along the Han River 1.77 million years ago. That’s just 130,000 years after the species first appeared in Africa.

(Side note: This river has been depositing layers of silt and gravel on the same terraces for at least 2 million years, and that’s just extremely cool.)

The revised date suggests that Homo erectus spread across Asia much more quickly than anthropologists had realized. So far, the oldest hominin bones found anywhere outside Africa are five skulls, along with hundreds of other bones, from Dmanisi Cave in Georgia. The Dmanisi bones are between 1.85 million and 1.77 million years old, and they (probably—more on that below) also belong to Homo erectus.

Until recently, the next-oldest Homo erectus fossils outside Africa were the 1.63-million-year-old fossils from another Chinese site, Gongwangling, a short distance north of Yunxian. (That’s not counting a couple of teeth from a site in southern China with an age that is a little less certain.) Those dates had suggested Homo erectus seemed to have taken a leisurely 140,000 years to spread east into Asia. But it now looks like hominins were living in Georgia and central China at about the same time, which means they spread out very fast, started earlier than we knew, or both.

All of this means that the Yunxian skulls are probably not—as a September 2025 study claimed—close ancestors of the enigmatic Denisovans. The authors of that paper had digitally reconstructed one of the skulls and concluded that it looked a lot like a 146,000-year-old skull from Harbin, China (which a recent DNA study identified as a Denisovan, also known as Homo longi).

The researchers had argued that the original owners of the Yunxian skulls had lived not long after the Denisovan/Homo longi branch of the hominin family tree split off from ours—in other words, that the Yunxian skulls weren’t mere Homo erectus but early Homo longi, close cousins of our own species. Using the original paleomagnetic dates for the Yunxian skulls, that study’s authors drew up a hominin family tree in which our species and Denisovans are more closely related to each other than either is to Neanderthals—one in which the branching happened much earlier than DNA evidence suggests.

There were many issues with those arguments, but the revised age for the Yunxian skulls sounds like a death knell for them. “1.77 million years is just too old to be a credible connection to the Denisovan group, which DNA tells us got started after around 700,000 years ago,” University of Wisconsin paleoanthropologist John Hawks, who was not involved in the study, told Ars in an email.

But the most interesting thing about these skulls being 1.77 million years old is that the date provides a reference point for understanding even older sites in China—sites that may suggest that Homo erectus wasn’t even the first hominin to make it this far.

Homo erectus first shows up in the fossil record around 1.9 million years ago in Africa, where it’s sometimes also called Homo ergaster because paleoanthropologists seem to enjoy naming things and then arguing about those names for several decades. A few hundred thousand years later, Homo erectus showed up everywhere: from South Africa northward to the Levant and from Dmanisi Cave in Georgia eastward to the islands of Indonesia.

We typically think of Homo erectus as the first of our hominin ancestors to expand beyond Africa, along routes that our own species would retread 1.5 million years later. More to the point, many paleoanthropologists think of them as the first hominin that could have adapted to so many different environments, each with its own challenges, along the way.

But we may need to give earlier members of our genus, like Homo habilis, a little more credit because stone tools from two other sites in China seem to be older than Homo erectus. At Shangchen, a site on the southern edge of China’s Loess Plateau, archaeologists unearthed stone tools from a 2.1-million-year-old layer of sediment. And at the Xihoudu site in northern China, stone tools date to 2.43 million years ago.

“If you have a site in China that’s 2.43 million years, and the origin of Homo erectus is 1.9 million years ago, either you need to push the origin of Homo erectus back to 2.5 or 2.6 million years or we need to accept that we need to be looking at other hominins that may have actually moved out of Africa,” University of Hawai’i at Manoa paleoanthropologist Christopher Bae, a coauthor of the new study, told Ars.

Archaeologists have unearthed stone tools but no hominin fossils at both sites, making it difficult to say for sure who the toolmakers were. But if they weren’t Homo erectus, the next most likely suspects would be older members of our genus, like Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. That would mean hominin expansion “out of Africa” actually happened several times during the history of our genus: once with early Homo, again with Homo erectus, and yet again with our species.

“There could have been an earlier wave that died out or interbred, so there’s all kinds of possibilities open there,” Purdue University paleoanthropologist Darryl Granger, also a coauthor of the recent study, told Ars.

In fact, there’s some debate about whether the Dmanisi fossils actually belonged to Homo erectus proper. One thing the two dueling reconstructions of the Yunxian skulls agree on is that those hominins had flattish faces, more like ours—and like the 1.63-million-year-old Homo erectus skull from Gongwangling. But the Dmanisi hominins’ lower faces project dramatically forward, like those of older hominins.

Some paleoanthropologists classify the Dmanisi fossils as their own species, but others argue they’re more like early members of our genus, such as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. Those earlier hominins may have been more capable of migrating and adapting than we’ve realized.

It’s still very clear, from both fossil and genetic evidence, that our species evolved in Africa and spread from there to the rest of the world. But it’s also increasingly clear that there were several other species of hominins in other places, doing other things, at least off and on, for a very long time before we showed up. Yunxian, and its revised age, could help anthropologists better understand part of that story.

“Actually being able to anchor the Homo erectus sites with firm, solid dates helps us try to reconfigure this model,” said Bae. “This is where Yunxian really plays a major role in this. Now that we’ve got older dates to anchor the Yunxian Homo erectus fossils, I think we can really bring in this discussion with Xihoudu and Shangchen.”

The answers may still lie buried—maybe just a few meters below the fossil skulls and stone tools at sites like Yunxian and Gongwangling, in older sediment layers. Archaeologists may not have seen a reason to explore these, since no one lived in China before 1.7 million years ago. The age of the Yunxian skulls, along with the even older stone tools at Shangchen and Xihoudu, may warrant deeper digging.

“People haven’t been looking for artifacts and fossils in two-plus million-year-old sediments in these locations in China,” said Granger. “I can think of places that I would like to go back and look if I had more time and money.”

At other sites, researchers have already unearthed fossil animal bones from the same age range as China’s oldest stone tools, but paleoanthropologists haven’t double-checked whether any of those bones might belong to early hominins rather than other mammals. Bae said, “It’s just that they haven’t been receiving any attention, or not enough attention.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With HBO’s critically acclaimed A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms gearing up for its season finale on Sunday, it’s time to check in on that other Game of Thrones spinoff: the far darker House of the Dragon, which now has a suitably ominous teaser for its upcoming third season.

(Spoilers for the first two seasons below.)

The series is set nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, when dragons were still a fixture of Westeros, and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen’s reign. The primary source material is Fire and Blood, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.

The first season spanned many years and featured some pretty significant time jumps, which required replacing the younger actors as their characters aged. For those who might need a refresher: King Viserys (Paddy Considine) died, and his second wife, Alicent (Olivia Cooke), conspired with her father, Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), to crown her eldest son, Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), as king instead of Viserys’ declared heir apparent, Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy).

Even though she was technically the rightful heir, Rhaenyra actually seemed to be considering House Hightower’s conditions for concession—until the arrogant Prince Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), Alicent’s younger son, went after Rhaenyra’s young son, Lucerys (Elliot Grihault). Both dragonriders failed to control their dragons, and Aemon’s much bigger dragon, Vhagar, gobbled up poor Lucerys and his little dragon, Arrax, in mid-air. The season closed with Rhaenyra and her husband/uncle Daemon (Matt Smith) receiving the devastating news, effectively dashing any hope of a peaceful resolution.

House of the Dragon has always taken a leisurely, more focused approach to its characters’ political maneuverings, interspersed with bursts of bloody violence, and S2 was no exception. But it opened with a bang: the infamous “Blood and Cheese” incident (well-known to book readers), in which assassins sent to take out Aemond as vengeance for Lucerys can’t find him and butcher Aegon’s eldest son instead. We lost a couple more dragons and several supporting characters in the ensuing chaos, and Aegon was so severely wounded that Aemond became regent—with no plan to relinquish the Iron Throne any time soon.

What we didn’t get to see: the spectacularly brutal Battle of the Gullet, the bloody conflict at sea that will now be a centerpiece action sequence for S3 after HBO trimmed S2’s episode count from 10 to eight. But the finale teed it up perfectly, as Rhaenyra finally declared outright dragon war (the nuclear option) following Aemond’s reckless destruction of Sharp Point. As for Aegon, he went into hiding in Braavos, intending to wait out the war before reclaiming his throne.

Much of the main cast—those whose characters survived S2, that is—are returning, including the aforementioned D’Arcy, Cooke, Smith, Glynn-Carney, Ifans, and Mitchell. Also returning: Steve Toussaint as Corlys; Sonoya Mizuno as Mysaria; Fabien Frankel as Criston Cole; Matthew Needham as Larys; Jefferson Hall as Jason and Tyland Lannister; Harry Collett as Jacaerys; Bethany Antonia as Baela; Phoebe Campbell as Rhaena; Phia Saban as Helaena; Kurt Egyiawan as Orwyle; Kieran Bew as Hugh Hammer; Abubakar Salim as Alyn of Hull; Clinton Liberty as Addam of Hull; Tom Bennett as Ulf White; Freddie Fox as Gwayne Hightower; and Gayle Rankin as Alys Rivers.

Joining the cast for S3 are James Norton as Ormund Hightower; Tommy Flanagan as Roderick Dustin; Dan Fogler as Torrhen Manderly; Tom Cullen as Luthor Largent; Joplin Sibtain as Jon Roxton; Barry Sloane as Adrian Redford; and Annie Shapero as Alysanne Blackwood.

The third season of House of the Dragon premieres on HBO this June. Look, we know this story doesn’t end well for anyone. It’s Westeros. But we also know we can expect a wild ride.</div>

            <h2>Nintendo brings GBA-era Pokémon to the Switch, but not Switch Online subscribers</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/pokemon-red-and-greens-gba-remakes-are-getting-re-released-on-switch-for-20-a-pop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For my money, the 2004 Game Boy Advance re-releases of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are still the best versions of the original Pokémon games. They fixed most of the bugs and balance issues present in the originals—partly by also including the rosters from Gold/Silver and Ruby/Sapphire—but they’re more faithful to the original gameplay, battling and catching mechanics, and graphics than the 2018 Let’s Go, Pikachu/Eevee! adaptations for the Switch.

Someone at Nintendo apparently agrees, as the company announced today that it’s re-releasing those games for the original Switch (and, by extension, the Switch 2, though no Switch 2-specific features were announced). The games will be available after a planned Pokémon Presents stream at 9 am Eastern/6 am Pacific on February 27.

Subscribers to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack are in for a disappointment, though. Instead of releasing FireRed and LeafGreen as part of the Switch Online Game Boy Advance collection, Nintendo will release both titles as standalone purchases that will run you $20 apiece. This means that players without a subscription will be able to buy and play the games. But given how few GBA games are available for the Switch Online service and how infrequently new ones are released, it does rankle to see otherwise unmodified ports of a prominent game bypass subscribers entirely.

The FireRed and LeafGreen ports will both support local wireless multiplayer, though not online multiplayer. The announcement originally said that support for Pokémon Home, the repository service that stores creatures from multiple Pokémon games, would be coming “soon,” but that note has since been removed. We’d still assume that players will eventually be able to use Home to import their FireRed and LeafGreen rosters to newer games in the series.

While the multiplayer Switch Online Game Boy Advance games all support wireless multiplayer in place of physical Game Link Cables, it’s particularly important for these games because they were the first Pokémon titles to support any kind of wireless multiplayer, even before the Nintendo DS made built-in Wi-Fi connectivity a standard console feature.

FireRed and LeafGreen were two of just a few dozen GBA games to support the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, a bulky, standalone accessory that latched to the top of the system and plugged in to its Link Cable port. The initial releases of the games actually included the wireless adapter as a pack-in accessory, which had to be supported by the game you were playing and couldn’t just work as a stand-in for a physical Link Cable in older games.

With the wireless adapter plugged in, up to 30 players could congregate in the game’s “Union Room” to do battles and trades—but given that Nintendo also recommended players stand within 10 feet of each other for the best experience, a 30-person Union Room would have gotten pretty crowded in real life.

FireRed and LeafGreen are adaptations of the original 1996 Pokémon games for the old black-and-white Game Boy. The names reference the original Japanese releases, Red and Green. A third version of the game with updated graphics and other changes, called Pokémon Blue, was released in Japan in late 1996, and this was the version that was localized and released in the US as Pokémon Red and Blue in 1998.

A final version of the base game, Pokémon Yellow, was released in Japan in 1998 and in the US in 1999, with some changes that tracked the plotline of the Pokémon anime (most prominently, mandating that players select an un-evolve-able Pikachu as their starter Pokémon). Most of the changes specific to this version of the game weren’t included in the FireRed and LeafGreen remakes.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Twitter founder Jack Dorsey is running into some serious issues while overhauling his financial services company, Block.

Earlier this month, the company started laying off its staff as part of what Bloomberg characterized as an “efficiency push,” potentially affecting up to ten percent of the company’s workforce.

It’s been a painful, drawn-out process that could drag on for weeks, sources told Wired, triggering major anxiety over job security.

“We don’t yet know if our livelihoods will be affected, and this makes it incredibly hard to make major life choices without knowing if we still have a job next week,” an employee said during a recent all-hands meeting, as quoted by Wired.

“Morale is probably the worst I’ve felt in four years,” another employee wrote. “The overarching culture at Block is crumbling.”

The comments highlight persistent concerns being felt by many workers as generative AI continues to be cited by executives as they cut headcounts.

For Dorsey, AI has clearly been top of mind. Block staffers are now obligated to use AI, an order that has led to frustration.

“Top-down mandates to use large language models are crazy,” one employee told Wired. “If the tool were good, we’d all just use it.”

They’re also required to send weekly update emails to him, echoing Elon Musk’s DOGE requirement for federal staffers to summarize five weekly achievements in emails. (The requirement was mostly ignored, months before DOGE largely crumbled.)

Dorsey then reportedly uses generative AI to summarize his staffers’ emails. During the all-hands meeting, he noted that “performance anxiety” and “widespread concerns about layoffs” were clearly vexing staff.

Dorsey seemingly did little to address these anxieties, accusing fired staffers of “phoning it in.” Block’s engineering lead, Arnaud Weber, also said that the firings were performance-related.

The company’s woes are symptomatic of a familiar story playing out at many other tech companies. Workers are facing immense pressure as their employers implement AI at all costs, forcing them to adopt the tech whether they like it or not.

Researchers have found that the tech isn’t reducing workloads at all, but intensifying them instead, a concerning trend that’s already leading to “AI burnout.”

The psychological effects also have experts worried. Researchers recently found that the continuing threat of being made redundant due to AI automation is manifesting in symptoms among workers including anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, and loss of identity.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Depending on who you ask, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is either the most sophisticated weapons platform ever built, or an $80 million disaster that’s too fragile for rain and its namesake lightning. What it definitely is, Dutch defense secretary Gijs Tuinman insists, is jailbreakable — “just like an iPhone.”

In an episode of the Danish podcast Boekestijn en De Wijk show, translated from Dutch by the Register, Tuinman suggested that the incredibly expensive F-35s could be maintained by European armies with or without support from the US.

“The F-35 is truly a shared product,” Tuinman told the interviewer. “The British make the Rolls-Royce engines, and the Americans simply need them too. And even if this mutual dependency doesn’t result in software updates, the F-35, in its current state, is still a better aircraft than other types of fighters.”

That being the case, he continued, “if you still want to upgrade despite everything — I’m going to say something I should never say, but I will anyway — you can jailbreak an F-35 just like an iPhone.”

Tuinman didn’t elaborate, and the Register didn’t receive any elaboration. Still, his comments reveal a fascinating anxiety between US arms manufacturers like Lockheed and European military.

Per the Register, the F-35 Lightning II gets routine software updates from Lockheed through a proprietary Automatic Logistics Information System, which pushes updates to the entire fleet every year or two. (Think of it like an expensive iOS update.)

Though European militaries might own the physical planes, the US controls the software. If Washington decides to stop sending updates — perhaps in retaliation for trade tariffs or an unfavorable deal on Greenland — there’s an implied threat that the Dutch air force will essentially be left with some very expensive bricks on the runway.

While it remains to be seen if Tuinman knows of some secret backdoor hack for the F-35, jailbreaking a world-class fighter jet is almost certainly easier said than done. Still, with fears from European countries that the US could remotely disable European fleets with a “kill switch,” it wouldn’t exactly be a bad time for the Dutch to start cracking the F-35’s codes.

            <h2>As Epstein Scandal Tightens, Trump Announces That He’s Releasing All Government Files About Alien Life</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/epstein-scandal-trump-files-alien-life">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump has plenty of work to do to distract from a growing list of crises, from the release of the Epstein files, many of which have implicated him, to a brewing battle with the Supreme Court, which just declared his tariffs illegal.

Now, Trump has found the next carrot to dangle: aliens.

In a Thursday evening post on Truth Social, Trump said that based “on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).” (What the difference between UAPs and UFOs is unclear, as the former term has conventionally been used by government officials to refer to the latter.)

Naturally, the surprising announcement — which likely caught many government officials off guard — was accompanied by Trump taking potshots at his predecessor, accusing former president Barack Obama of revealing “classified” information, referencing Obama’s claim that aliens “are real” during a podcast appearance last week.

When asked by YouTuber Bryan Tyler Cohen if aliens are indeed real during a “lightning round” segment, Obama demurred.

“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them. And they’re not being kept in — what is it? — Area 51.”

“There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” he added.

Days later, Obama further clarified in an NBC News interview that he had seen “no evidence” of aliens, suggesting Trump may have woefully misinterpreted his remarks.

Whether anything will come of Trump’s theatrical promise to direct his agencies to release files on “alien and extraterrestrial life” remains uncertain as ever. The topic of UAPs has gotten plenty of media attention in the last couple of years, culminating in several releases of UFO documents throughout the Biden administration. One hotly anticipated declassified report, which was released in June 2021, turned out to be largely disappointing, further underlining that the US government still has no idea what had caused several high-profile UAP sightings, which were revealed in 2017 in an exposé by the New York Times.

The Pentagon has also been trickling out documents acknowledging its interest in these sightings for many years now.

In short, it remains entirely unclear what other documents government agencies may still be holding on to or whether we’ll actually learn anything new.

What’s far more likely is that Trump continues to desperately try to control the narrative — as even Republicans are getting tired of his antics.

“They’ve deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren’t going away… even for aliens,” representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) tweeted.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin is struggling to regain the momentum it had in 2025, the first year of Trump’s extremely crypto-friendly administration.

The token is still hovering around the $67,000 mark, a major loss compared to its October all-time high of just under twice that. It has experienced its worst-ever start to a year, dropping 24 percent in the first 50 days of the year.

That tooth-rattling downturn has certain critics predicting a total collapse, suggesting its value could eventually plunge to zero dollars — a controversial stance that’s sparked a fierce debate. Proponents argue the core fundamentals haven’t changed at all, and that Bitcoin’s demise was the result of major macroeconomic uncertainty, questionable Federal Reserve policy, and major selloffs triggered by fears over a growing AI bubble.

Critics, however, point to Bitcoin becoming untethered from the value of gold, an identity crisis undermining its long-touted role as a “digital gold” safe haven for investors.

It’s a conundrum that has spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt — or FUD, a popular term in crypto circles. As one viral post on X pointed out, Google Trends has shown a major uptick for the queries “Bitcoin going to zero” and “Is Bitcoin dead?”

As Decrypt points out, the “Crypto Fear and Greed Index,” a metric that’s designed to reflect the broader crypto market sentiment, has since swung to “extreme fear,” hitting its lowest mark since 2019.

For what it’s worth, users on the prediction betting platform Polymarket are also far more prone to believe that Bitcoin will hit $60,000 before recovering to $80,000.

But the claim that the coin could indeed crash down to zero, effectively wiping out all of its value, remains widely contested. If you believe Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, it’s all uphill from here.

“We may be in the middle of a crypto winter, but spring is coming — and Bitcoin is winning,” he tweeted earlier this week.

“If it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million,” he added in a separate post today.

Skeptics, however, are far more pessimistic about Bitcoin’s chances in the long run, saying the crypto has lost its way.

“After more than 15 years of bitcoin, we’re no closer to knowing what its point is,” argued Globe and Mail investment reporter Tim Shuffelt. “There is no story behind bitcoin any more. It’s not even clear why it has had such a calamitous few months at the precise moment the Trump administration was supposed to be ushering in a golden age of crypto.”

Others predict Bitcoin will slide to $50,000 before making any recovery.

“I think we are going to see more pain and a final capitulation period for digital asset prices in the next few months,” Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, told The Block.

Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, also warned that if Bitcoin were to crash even further, it could result in a “death spiral.”

If critics are to be believed, Bitcoin’s losses are only getting started as more people start to question its role as an untethered, highly speculative, and volatile asset. But Bitcoin has recovered from major crashes many times before, and a recovery is still far from being out of the question.

            <div id="article-text">Eventually, it seems to turn out that every consumer product is killing you — from cooking utensils to menstrual care products, and literally the kitchen sink. Now, one of our most beloved creature comforts is getting its own heel turn.

A new analysis by the European Union-funded ToxFree Life for All project took a look at 81 headphone models from producers around the world. The results were pretty grim: every single model tested contained substances considered hazardous to humans, including bisphenols, phthalates, and flame retardants. Not even premium brands like Bose and Sennheiser received a clean bill of health, culminating in what ToxFree calls a “complete market failure.”

Most alarmingly, researchers found Bisphenol A — an industrial chemical linked to infertility, obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes — in 177 of the 180 total samples taken from the 81 devices.

“These chemicals are not just additives; they may be migrating from the headphones into our body,” Karolína Brabcová, a chemical researcher with ToxFree told the Guardian. “Daily use — especially during exercise when heat and sweat are present — accelerates this migration directly to the skin.”

Per Brabcová, the chemicals don’t pose an “immediate health risk,” so it’s not like your ears are about to fall off. The real danger here comes from long-term exposure to the “chemical cocktail” present in headphones, especially for vulnerable groups like expectant mothers or young children. “There is no ‘safe’ level for endocrine disruptors that mimic our natural hormones,” as Brabcová explained.

“Given the prolonged skin contact associated with headphone use, dermal exposure represents a relevant pathway, and it is reasonable to assume that similar migration of BPA and its substitutes may occur from headphone components directly to the user’s skin,” the researchers wrote in their report.

This is why, despite finding relatively low traces of most chemicals in the tested headphones, the researchers are using their findings as a rallying cry to call for sweeping bans on endocrine-disrupting chemicals in consumer products. Though chemicals like BPAs are selectively banned in the EU, critical loopholes remain that allow the substances to re-enter the market through recycled plastics.

“We urge EU policymakers to abandon the ‘substance-by-substance’ approach and implement comprehensive bans on chemical classes to prevent regrettable substitution and ensure safety is a market standard, not a consumer burden,” the researchers concluded.

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic aired a spicy ad during this year’s Super Bowl, skewering competitor OpenAI’s decision to cram ChatGPT with ads for users who don’t pay for a subscription.

“Ads are coming to AI,” the ad’s tagline reads. “But not to Claude.”

The marketing campaign appeared to hit a nerve, sending OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — who called ads a “last resort” a mere two years ago — into a tailspin in which he accused Anthropic of “doublespeak.”

Needless to say, it’s a hot-button topic in the AI industry as companies continue to look for new ways to recoup some of their gigantic losses. Just last week, OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig announced her resignation in a New York Times essay, warning that the company may use ads to manipulate “users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.”

Ads in AI tools have become so controversial that other players in the space are second-guessing as well. As the Financial Times reports, AI startup Perplexity, which became one of the first generative AI companies to introduce ads back in 2024, alongside paid subscriptions, has now abandoned advertising altogether.

The company cited fears over eroding user trust, calling it quits on ads after several months of winding them down.

“A user needs to believe this is the best possible answer, to keep using the product and be willing to pay for it,” an unnamed Perplexity executive toldthe FT, saying that the “challenge with ads is that a user would just start doubting everything… which is why we don’t see it as a fruitful thing to focus on right now.”

“We are in the accuracy business, and the business is giving the truth, the right answers,” another executive added, arguing that ads are “misaligned with what the users want.”

It’s a surprising 180-degree turn. Why the two executives refused to be named in the FT‘s reporting is unclear, but the decision suggests that the company is treading very carefully.

It’s also a sobering assessment of the significant potential for user blowback if other AI companies follow suit and introduce ads, like OpenAI or Google. For now, some of the biggest players in the AI space are offering extremely similar chatbots whose capabilities overlap considerably. The fear: ads could easily trigger a user exodus, further undermining AI companies’ attempts to differentiate themselves.

For now, Perplexity’s main source of revenue is paid subscriptions, which range from $20 to $200 a month. Anthropic is similarly relying on subscriptions that range from $20 to $100 a month for regular consumers.

But whether either company will be able to convince investors that subscriptions are enough to make up for far bigger expenses remains to be seen.

At a valuation of $18 billion, Perplexity lags far behind the AI industry lead. But its latest move highlights a growing rift as companies ponder how to climb out of a gigantic — and deepening — financial hole.

Apple this week released the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS 26.4, which introduces several new features, including an AI-powered playlist generation feature in Apple Music, support for video content in the Podcasts app, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for RCS messages, and more.

The update is currently available in pubic beta, with the public release expected sometime in March or April.

One of the most noticeable improvements arrives in Apple Music. iOS 26.4 introduces a new AI-powered “Playlist Playground” feature that leverages Apple Intelligence. The feature allows users to generate a custom 25-song playlist from a text prompt, such as “upbeat workout mix” or “calm evening.” Users can then further refine the results and even select matching cover art.

In addition, Apple Music’s user interface itself has been refreshed to showcase full-screen artwork for albums and playlists.

Plus, Apple Music is getting a new “Concerts Near You” section that helps users discover live shows from their favourite artists. You can filter this section by Date and Genre, or switch locations if you’re traveling.

Following Spotify’s push into video, Apple’s Podcasts app is making it easy to switch back and forth between audio and video episodes with this release. Creators can publish video podcasts using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), and listeners can seamlessly switch between audio and video playback within the same episode, moving to a full horizontal display if they choose.

At launch, the video episodes will be integrated with other Apple Podcasts features, like personalized recommendations and editorial curation on the New tab and Category pages, just as audio podcasts are.

HLS also brings an automatic quality adjustment feature, which helps videos play better whether listeners are on Wi-Fi or cellular. Plus, users will be able to download video episodes for offline viewing. At launch, HLS is supported by Acast, Amazon’s ART19, Triton’s Omny Studio, and SiriusXM, including SiriusXM Media, AdsWizz, and Simplecast.

Creators will be able to dynamically insert video ads, including host-read spots, into their podcasts, too. Apple doesn’t charge creators to distribute podcasts, but it says that, starting later this year, participating ad networks will have to pay an impression-based fee for the delivery of the dynamic ads in the HLS videos.

Messaging is also receiving an important upgrade with encrypted Rich Communication Services (RCS), which begins testing in iOS 26.4. End-to-end encryption for RCS conversations will one day help ensure messages between iPhone users and Android users are just as secure as iMessage.

Currently, Apple is only testing this between iPhones in beta. These conversations will be labeled as encrypted, and cannot be read while sent between devices. The company notes that the feature will be released publicly in a later software update for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS, and the beta is not available for all devices and carriers.

Security improvements are another highlight of iOS 26.4. Stolen Device Protection is now enabled by default, adding an extra layer of biometric authentication for sensitive actions such as accessing saved passwords or making certain account changes. By requiring Face ID or Touch ID authentication in more scenarios, Apple reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a device is stolen and the passcode is compromised.

Drivers using Apple CarPlay will also notice changes. CarPlay now supports in-car video playback for select apps — including the Apple TV app —but only when the vehicle is parked to ensure safety. This enhancement introduces new entertainment options for passengers when they’re stopped or while waiting in the car for a period of time. (Hooray for parents in the pick-up line at school!)

CarPlay for the first time will offer access to third-party AI services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude.

Meanwhile, the Camera app introduces Audio Zoom. When recording video, the microphone focuses on the subject as you zoom in, reducing background noise and enhancing clarity. This feature makes it easier to capture speeches, performances, or interviews without external audio equipment.

Additionally, the Ambient Music feature is now accessible through a widget, letting users instantly play soundscapes designed for focus, sleep, or relaxation directly from the Home Screen, instead of just the Control Center as before. The feature, first introduced in iOS 18.4, added a variety of ambient sounds to stream across categories like Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing.

There’s also a new “Urgent” section in the Reminders app that groups high-priority tasks and can trigger more prominent alerts when deadlines approach. Setting a reminder as Urgent will add an alarm so you’re sure not to miss the event.

Notably absent from this release is a next-generation Siri experience. While Apple has signaled deeper AI ambitions for its voice assistant, those larger changes do not appear in iOS 26.4, reportedly delayed once again.

Even without a background in accounting, anyone who has ever glanced at a 10-K or 10-Q can tell that preparing financial statements is a complex, tedious process.

While legacy platforms like Workiva and Donnelley Financial Solutions aim to streamline financial reporting, longtime accountants Mary Antony (pictured right) and Kelsey Gootnick (pictured center) found themselves exhausted by various manual hurdles within these tools (co-founder and CTO Jared Tibshraeny is pictured left).

The duo met seven years ago at Flexport, where Gootnick served as the company’s controller and Antony served as assistant controller. They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.

No matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.

“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch.

So, in 2023, the pair decided to launch InScope, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

While InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.

Over the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the top 15 nationally.

Of course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.

Norwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.

Jacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.

“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.

Antony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.

Different AI labs have different priorities. OpenAI has traditionally focused on consumer users, for instance, while its rival Anthropic tends to target enterprises. Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.

On Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI, the AI startup recently acquired by SpaceX, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:

In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.

Of course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?

To answer that question, our resident RPG enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call “BaldurBench.”

In the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

First, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and theorycraft, which is about what you would expect.

There are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to bold important words.

The biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying, “Don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!

It’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to Business Insider’s reporting) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.

A U.S. federal court has sentenced a Ukrainian man to five years in prison for his part in a long-running identity theft operation that helped overseas North Korean workers gain fraudulent employment at dozens of U.S. companies.

U.S. prosecutors brought charges in 2024 against Oleksandr Didenko, 29, a resident of Kyiv, for setting up North Koreans with stolen identities of U.S. citizens to get hired and earn a wage. Under this scheme, the workers’ earnings were funneled back to Pyongyang, which the regime used to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program.

This is the latest in a string of recent convictions of individuals involved in facilitating ongoing North Korean so-called “IT worker” schemes. Security researchers have described North Korean workers as a “triple threat” to U.S. and Western businesses, as they violate U.S. sanctions, all the while enabling North Koreans to steal sensitive company data, and then later extort those victim companies into not publicly releasing corporate secrets.

Prosecutors said Didenko ran a website called Upworksell, which allowed people working overseas, including North Koreans, to buy or rent stolen identities for gaining employment with U.S. firms. Didenko handled more than 870 stolen identities, per the Justice Department.

The FBI seized Upworksell in 2024 and diverted its traffic to its own servers. Polish authorities arrested Didenko, who was then extradited to the U.S. and later pleaded guilty.

In a statement this week, the U.S. Department of Justice said Didenko also paid people to receive and host computers at their homes in California, Tennessee, and Virginia. These “laptop farms” are rooms containing racks of open laptops, allowing North Koreans to remotely perform their work as if they were physically in the United States.

Security giant CrowdStrike said last year that it has seen a sharp rise in the number of North Korean workers infiltrating companies, often as remote developers or other technical software engineering jobs. The scheme is among many that the North Korean regime uses to enrich itself, while unable to use the global financial system, thanks to international sanctions.

North Koreans are also known to impersonate recruiters and VCs in efforts to trick unsuspecting high-profile and high-net-worth victims into granting access to their computers, including crypto.

A judge has denied Tesla’s request to overturn a $243 million jury verdict that held the automaker partially responsible for a fatal crash involving its Autopilot driver assistance system.

“The grounds for relief that Tesla relies upon are virtually the same as those Tesla put forth previously during the course of trial and in their briefings on summary judgment — arguments that were already considered and rejected,” Hon. Judge Beth Bloom’s decision reads. “Furthermore, Tesla does not present additional arguments or controlling law that persuades this Court to alter its earlier decisions or the jury verdict.”

Last August, a jury awarded a $243 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash in Florida that killed Naibel Benavides and critically injured Dillon Angulo. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla. Notably, the jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla.

Tesla’s lawyers argued, in its request to reverse the ruling, that the blame rested on the driver, who helped cause the crash.

Threads already has over 400 million monthly users, but Meta wants to push that number even higher. With the launch of a new Threads feature this week, the company is making it easier for Threads users to share posts on the app to their Instagram Stories — a move that could capitalize on Instagram’s larger user base to bring more people to Meta’s X competitor.

The company announced on Thursday a new feature that lets you share a Threads post to your Instagram Story without having to leave the Threads app, instead previewing how the post would look on your Story directly within the Threads app.

The app previously allowed you to share anyone’s Threads post to your Instagram Story similar to how you would reshare someone’s Instagram post to your Story. It also already offered tools for sharing posts to your Instagram Feed or DMs.

Meta’s text-first, Twitter-like app Threads first launched in July 2023 and benefited from its ties with Instagram to rapidly grow its initial user base. To sign up, users had to authenticate with their Instagram credentials, which allowed Threads to populate with account details, like username, bio, and photo, as well as verification status and followers.

With one tap, users could immediately follow the accounts they already followed on Instagram — and those not on Threads would get a notification that someone had added them.

In the months and years following its launch, Meta has heavily leaned on its other, bigger social platforms to continue to grow Threads, including by displaying popular Threads posts on Facebook and adding a similar carousel of Threads posts to Instagram users. The company also made it easy for users to cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads, which also helped boost adoption.

These moves have paid off. Data from market intelligence provider Similarweb last month indicated that Threads is now seeing more daily usage than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. (X still dominates on the web, however.) Threads’ numbers overall have been steadily growing as well, doubling usage from 200 million monthly active users in August 2024 to 400 million monthly users as of August 2025. The company announced in October that Threads reached 150 million daily active users, as well.

The Trump tariffs are dead. Long live the Trump tariffs?

This morning, in a 6–3 opinion, the Supreme Court struck down the bulk of the president’s sweeping global tariffs. The majority ruled that the law Donald Trump had used to carry out most of his trade policies does not, in fact, allow the president to impose tariffs at all. This is a major setback for Trump’s trade agenda, but it is far from a fatal one. The president has several alternatives that he can use to reconstruct his tariff regime, and his administration has spent months putting a plan in place to do so. Those efforts, too, may eventually be challenged in court, but fully litigating them would take years. Unless the president suddenly has a change of heart, Trump’s tariff adventure is far from over.

The case before the court centered on a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which authorizes the president to “regulate” the importation of goods in a national emergency that arises from an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” The Trump administration had interpreted this vague statute, which had never been used to justify tariffs, to mean that the president can issue tariffs of whatever kind he wants, whenever he wants, on any country he wants, so long as he says an emergency exists, all without getting congressional approval. IEEPA was the basis of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China last February, the “reciprocal” tariffs he levied on almost every country in the world on Liberation Day, and most of the one-off tariffs he has issued or threatened to impose on trade partners such as Brazil, India, and, more recently, Europe and Canada. (Industry-specific tariffs on goods such as steel and aluminum have been imposed under separate, more legally sound authorities, and are not affected by the ruling.)

Last year, the lower courts ruled that although IEEPA might allow some tariffs, it certainly didn’t allow these tariffs—many of which were set at arbitrary levels, on an arbitrary set of countries, using justifications that could hardly be thought of as a true national emergency (such as the existence of a trade deficit or an imaginary surge of fentanyl shipments from Canada). The Supreme Court went even further. “We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs,” Chief Justice John Roberts declared.

But even as it insisted that the law was on its side, the administration spent much of the past year preparing a backup plan to rebuild Trump’s tariff wall in case the courts ruled against them. Because, as the president observed on Truth Social a few hours after the ruling, “the Supreme Court did not overrule TARIFFS, they merely overruled a particular use of IEEPA TARIFFS.”

According to top Trump-administration officials such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the administration’s plan draws on two main authorities. The first is Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. That law allows the president to levy tariffs of up to 15 percent on any country for up to 150 days to address “large and serious balance-of-payment deficits,” a term that refers to more money leaving the country than coming into it. After the initial window, the tariff must be reauthorized by Congress. According to estimates by Clark Packard and Stan Vueger, trade experts at the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute, respectively, this technique alone would allow Trump to reinstate 70 percent of the tariff revenue struck down by the Supreme Court. This would be a temporary solution, and overbroad use of Section 122 could also be invalidated by the courts. It would most likely be intended only as a stopgap measure to buy time while the administration begins work on the second part of its plan.

Phase two would draw on Section 301 of the same law. Section 301 allows a presidential administration to levy essentially permanent tariffs of any kind on any country in response to “unfair” trade practices. The catch is that the tariffs can come into effect only after the federal government has navigated several layers of bureaucratic process, including launching an official investigation into the unfair practices of the country in question, compiling a report detailing those practices, and offering a public notice-and-comment period. That’s where the 150 days comes in. The administration could use that time to launch investigations into the U.S.’s major trading partners so that once the five months are expired, the paperwork is already in place to switch to indefinite tariffs under Section 301. This authority rests on stronger constitutional grounds. The first Trump administration and the Biden administration both used section 301 to impose or raise tariffs on Chinese goods. Courts have generally been deferential to how presidents use the authority as long as the proper process has been followed.

Trump has already signaled that he plans to use all the legal authorities at his disposal. “Therefore, effective immediately, all National Security TARIFFS, Section 232 and existing Section 301 TARIFFS, remain in place, and in full force and effect,” he wrote in his Truth Social post. “Today I will sign an Order to impose a 10% GLOBAL TARIFF, under Section 122, over and above our normal TARIFFS already being charged, and we are also initiating several Section 301 and other Investigations to protect our Country from unfair Trading practices.”

Most experts I spoke with think that this one-two combination will allow Trump to functionally rebuild most of the current tariff regime in a way that could survive in court. “Nearly 90 percent of U.S. trade comes from our 20 largest trading partners,” Peter Harell, who served as a top trade adviser in the Biden administration, told me before the ruling came down. “I don’t think it would be too difficult to reconstitute tariffs on most of them in 150 days.”

Less clear is the degree to which the Court’s ruling will restrain Trump’s ability to impose new tariffs. The president is not really a notice-and-comment kind of guy. He prefers to use the threat of sudden, unpredictable tariffs to coerce other countries to do his bidding or punish them for crossing him. So far this year, he has threatened 25 percent tariffs on Europe over their unwillingness to hand Greenland over to him and100 percent tariffs on Canada for making a deal with China; he has also threated to “raise tariffs very quickly” on India for buying Russian oil. Such threats will be less intimidating if they have an upper bound of 15 percent (Section 122) or require a drawn-out bureaucratic process before implementation (Section 301). “They will lose quite a bit of flexibility,” Vueger told me. “Trump loves to threaten higher and higher tariffs on whatever country for whatever reason—and these tools just weren’t designed to do that.”

The administration appears to acknowledge this reality. Part of its legal argument for upholding IEEPA was that the alternatives would deny the president flexibility and immediacy. As Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, has noted in previous testimony, “other tools” are “procedurally time-consuming and do not allow for immediate action.”

Rogé Karma: So, about those big trade deals

Perhaps Trump will simply make a mockery of the procedural requirements under Section 301. He could threaten Canada on Monday morning, have his trade representative launch an “investigation” into Canadian trade practices that afternoon, and issue a “report” by Tuesday detailing why those tariffs are justified. Or he might try to rely on an even older legal provision: Section 338 of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. This allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on any country if the president determines that it has discriminatory trade practices toward the United States.

Either of these options would be vulnerable to court challenges. Courts are likely to strike down Section 301 tariffs on purely procedural grounds if the administration rushes them through without proper process. Section 338 of Smoot-Hawley, meanwhile, has never been used, and some question exists as to whether it still applies as law at all or whether it was superseded entirely by the 1974 bill. Even if it’s still good law, courts may rule that its use requires approval from the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent agency that conducts investigations into trade disputes, or that the “discriminatory acts” justification doesn’t apply to countries with which the U.S. has “most favored nation” trading status—every country except Cuba, North Korea, Russia, and Belarus.

But those legal challenges, even if successful, might not constrain Trump all that much. The president could simply keep pushing the boundaries of different authorities to keep some version of tariffs in place while litigation takes its sweet time to resolve. The courts already took a year to decide on IEEPA. Who knows how long it would take them to overturn each one of these potential alternative efforts? “If you’re issuing separate country-by-country tariffs, then it’s likely they will have to be litigated one by one,” Vueger said.

But this type of strategic legal brinkmanship would create a logistical nightmare for businesses, with potentially painful economic consequences. Tariffs would constantly be overturned and refunded. Businesses would have no certainty to make investments. Companies would probably raise prices preemptively. “It would be total, complete chaos,” Harrell told me.

One institution could put an end to all of this at any time: Congress. The Constitution gives the legislative branch the power to regulate international trade; the only reason Trump is able to levy tariffs at all is because of previous laws passed by Congress that have given him that authority. Congress could decide to take that authority away. So far, a handful of Republicans have complained loudly about tariffs, but almost none have been willing to actually do anything about them.

If Trump were behaving purely rationally, he probably wouldn’t try any more tariff workarounds, given how unpopular his tariffs are and how much the cost of living dominates voter sentiment. He would simply accept a loss at the Supreme Court and move on. Without the tariffs in place, prices would likely come down, and the Federal Reserve might be more confident about lowering interest rates.

But for Trump, the tariff power is about a lot more than tariffs. It’s the primary way he exerts dominance over American companies and foreign countries. And he has shown little indication that he would ever be willing to give that up.</div>

Silicon Valley relies on hype cycles. But for the past few weeks, AI insiders have been spooked by advances coming from their tools. On this week’s Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel helps listeners calibrate their anxiety about AI’s next phase. The episode examines what’s new: AI-agent coding tools that can work in the background like personal assistants. Warzel is joined by Anil Dash, a longtime technologist, to unpack how hype and venture-capital incentives can distort the conversation around advances, and what the rise of tools like Claude Code and the more reckless “OpenClaw” experiments mean for labor, security, and everyday work. Dash outlines the very real risks of AI to explain why some people are panicking, why others are quietly building alternatives, and what to watch for as AI moves beyond chatbots to autonomous agents.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Anil Dash: A huge part of the cultural tension around these things is everybody advocating them is like, Why wouldn’t you love this? And everybody whose industry is being destroyed by them is saying, like, You are immiserating us while you’re putting us out of work.

Charlie Warzel:  I’m Charlie Warzel. This is Galaxy Brain, a show where today we are going to calibrate our anxiety about AI.

Because it’s a weird moment right now in the world of AI.

To put it bluntly, there are just a lot of people freaking out. And I think a big part of that freak-out has to do with the rise of coding agents.

I’ll explain what that is, but first I think it’s important to go back a little bit. At the end of 2022, ChatGPT came out. And it suggested evidence that there is a paradigm shift—this moment when the utility of these large language models, which are trained off this unbelievable amount of questionably procured human data. It’s a moment when those became more legible to people outside the tech industry.

Chatbots allowed people to interact with these models like they would a human. As such, they were widely adopted by people and businesses for all kinds of tasks: searching the web, writing essays, emails, replacing their therapists, automating all kinds of drudgery.

And so we got hallucinations and AI girlfriends. Slop. We also got a lot of people and companies relying on these tools to remove any and all friction from their lives. You had evangelists who saw these models get better at benchmark tests, and they speculated about whether real intelligence could ever spring from the tools. But you had others who saw them as basically just an advanced form of human mimicry based off this corpus of stolen information and forced on society by big tech and venture capitalists, who at the same time warned of a future where all these white-collar jobs could go away.

This winter, I think, marks the first paradigm shift in the AI world since the chatbots. And the reason for this is the arrival and deployment of coding agents. Agents like OpenAI’s GPT 5.3 Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code. These agents are capable of automating many aspects of white-collar work.

The tools are less user-friendly than chatbots, but the results are often way more impressive. You can give them access to your computer or a given program. You can prompt them with a series of tasks like “Clean out my inbox; pay my credit-card bill; book me a flight to Fiji.” Basically, they act like a personal assistant. And they go off and they do it, often quite well.

It’s far from perfect, but it feels like a genuine step forward. And so, cue the freak-out.

In the last few weeks on platforms like X—where a lot of the AI discourse tends to happen—there’s been an unbelievable amount of bluster about these AI agents and the speed with which everything is changing.

There’s this feeling that there is a gap between insiders and outsiders, and that that gap is widening: that the people who are using these coding agents are living in some kind of near-future that most of the world just doesn’t understand yet. And so you get a lot of posts like this one from X’s product lead, Nikita Bier:

“Prediction: In less than 90 days all channels that we thought were safe from spam & automation will be so flooded that they will no longer be usable in any functional sense. iMessage, phone calls, Gmail. And we will have no way to stop it.”

You get people saying that they’ve built entire season-long podcasts in a weekend using the agents, or claiming that entire industries will soon be obsolete.

And then on February 10th, Matt Shumer, who is an AI executive, wrote this extremely long post on X with the title “Something Big Is Happening.” Now, this post went viral by just about any standard, and especially on X. In six days it has more than 83 million views, according to the platform’s own metrics. And the piece begins with a warning: “Think back to February 2020.”

Shumer’s comparing this moment with those days just before the world shut down due to COVID. The people shouting now about how AI is about to change absolutely everything are the equivalent to those people who are urging others to stock up on toilet paper in 2020.

“I am no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job,” Shumer writes. And he ends the post ominously:

“I know the next two to five years are going to be disorienting in ways that most people aren’t prepared for. This is already happening in my world. It’s coming to yours.”

Now, Shumer’s likely doing a few things here. One, he’s talking his book. He’s bought into the AI industry. He has at least some vested interest in where all of this is headed.

The COVID comparison is what you might call a sensational framework—one that’s clearly meant to strike at least some trepidation into people’s minds. The post portrays the things the AI industry is building as civilizationally important to the point of being dangerous. That’s just good marketing.

On the other hand, Shumer’s post is drafting off a few real feelings. You can see it in the backlash to the onslaught of AI ads at the Super Bowl. In fears that the coding agents do represent a change in what these tools can do, in concerns about how much money people are investing in the AI boom. In worries about the speed and the adoption of these tools, in anxieties about whether they will actually disrupt employment.

Now these fears don’t necessitate believing in AGI. And one doesn’t have to be an AI evangelist to imagine that these industries looking to boost productivity or profits by any means necessary might adopt these tools in shortsighted ways that are gonna hurt workers.

It’s precisely because of all these fears and evangelism that the AI conversation is extremely polarized. The hype is intense, it’s occasionally absurd, and it’s sometimes scary. But the change in the technology is also real. So how should we be thinking about AI in this moment? That’s the reason I wanted to talk to Anil Dash.

Anil has been working in tech for over 25 years. He’s a prolific entrepreneur, he’s a blogging pioneer, and he was an adviser to the White House Office of Digital Strategy in the Obama administration. Most importantly, he’s been working with and participating in the world of coding long enough to see a whole bunch of boom-and-bust cycles in this tech world.

He has a really nuanced view of large language models and AI tools, and also a sharp critical eye for the industry at large. He joins me now to help us understand how to navigate this moment.

Warzel: Anil Dash, welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Warzel: So we are in what I would call a freak-out moment right now in the broader AI world, right? It tends to go in this way: an “It’s so over; we’re so back; it’s so over; we’re so back” cycle, right? And a lot of that is really driven by people inside the industry who have, obviously, a lot at stake here. Like personally, financially. In talking their books, in freaking out, etc. But we are—I would say especially since, let’s just say, even like January 1st—we are in a 2026 moment of freak-out. Could you walk me through it from your perspective? What has changed in the last couple of months? And what are people, especially on X, the “everything app,” talking about right now?

Dash: Yeah. There’s another acceleration phase. So if you don’t mind, I’ll go back a little bit just for, you know, context.

Dash: We have had machine-learning systems for 75 years, right? And been talking about, you know, AI for half a century. So this is not a new space. And we’ve had these cycles for a long time. And then LLMs, right, are not new, right? We’re eight years in. So we’ve had a lot of cycles and a lot of time to learn how this goes.

And then the hyper-investment now is even there three, four years in. So we’ve started to see the patterns repeat and how these things evolve.

Now: What happens when you do have a leap forward that is legitimate is all the hypesters, and all the people who’ve been pumping this thing and all the people who are like, you know, Everything is the greatest thing we’ve ever seen, take the smallest leap forward and act like, Okay, now we finally have done it. This is AGI, this is the coming of the AI god. This is like, you know, gonna be the thing that solves everything. And, you know, that’s the part where I think we get into “We’re so back.”

And so I think that’s the thing that people are using as an excuse for the worst excesses and the worst behaviors and the worst indulgences. Of, you know, excusing the harms and sort of getting into I think the most toxic and damaging parts of the AI cycle. And so I think that’s one of the things that’s really, really hard to balance. But that’s the crux of it. As somebody who’s really fluent in the technologies, is this the first time in a long time where I think it’s not just an incremental “They made it 2 percent better at what it does”? Where it’s like, “Oh, okay; there’s been a real interesting inflection point.” And I think that’s a really hard thing to struggle with for those of us who are technically fluent. Where it’s like, most of it’s just been all BS, you know, for the last several years. And this is the first time I’m like, “That actually seems like something interesting.”

Warzel: So let’s draw down specifically on that. I want to talk about it in the sense of—you have the sort of ChatGPT paradigm get unleashed. Which is chatbots, right? And they talk; you type in prompts to them; they mimic human language; they can do a lot of stuff. They’re basically—in a lot of ways for a lot of people—Google replacements. Or, you know, like “Write a five-paragraph essay” kind of stuff. Have lots of utility in certain spaces. But that’s one sort of paradigm that people get used to, this chatbot idea.

The release of these agentic-coding things, like Claude Code being one. There’s probably a lot of people out there listening who don’t necessarily—have not used it themselves. They’ve kind of heard about it.

Can you just walk me through what those agentic coders are doing? Why it is that paradigm shift? Why it is that actual, true improvement that’s not just incremental?

Dash: Sure. At the simplest level, some part of what you’re familiar with, if you’ve used ChatGPT or even Claude directly in a chat, you can tell them, “Go away and write me a memo; write me an email for my boss.” And it’ll come back with a document for you. And it might not be great, but it’ll be there. And a lot of coders were doing the same thing. So they would say, “Write me a block of code that does this task.” And it might have been okay; it might have been passable. It might not have been. But it was sort of analogous to what we would do in our other work. And that was how coders were working until maybe a year ago.

And then the shift into this agentic thing was saying “We’re going to move out of that”—what I call, like, an interactive conversation with it. Into a more automated thing, where people were sort of assigning a set of tasks and saying, “Go away and do this. And don’t come back until the thing you have works.” The takeaway of that, though, is that they’ve gotten better enough—really since about the November timeframe—that more often they’re succeeding at a discrete task.

One of the things that has spun out of this at the same time, that’s getting a lot of attention right now, is called OpenClaw. This is the full-YOLO version of this. Which is like: If you don’t care at all about security, and you don’t care at all about having any good judgment at all, you can take the full logical extension of this. Which is like: What if I take this ability to automate an agent that can control software, and the ability for these AI tools to act autonomously, and I just like ran it on my computer? Gave it all my passwords, all of my accounts, and was just like, Let’s go. And that is what OpenClaw is. Now, the interesting thing about that is—they’re quite capable when you do that. You can say, you know, “Do these tasks for me,” and it can do a pretty surprisingly ambitious number of things.

Warzel: Yeah, are there good examples of that for the layperson? Of successful ways people are using this?

Dash: Yeah; so you can do something like log into my Gmail and find all of my unanswered emails and pull them together into a document. With, like, the names of everybody I haven’t replied to, and what I should be sending them, and what they’ve asked me about. And that’s a pretty practical thing. Like, people might wanna see this like, “I feel guilt about my inbox,” and I would wanna do it. Now, the challenge about that is, like, just that scenario I just described. Like: Think about the way Google accounts work, right? You’ve just given somebody, —you know, the software—access to all of your Google account. Which is your email, your calendar, your docs. And that means everything else that’s in there. Because, remember every time you have reset your password? Your passwords are in there, right. And your bank has sent your password. So, like, everything is in there. And then because the tool responds to plain-English commands, then if somebody else emails you and said—and the software is called OpenClaw—and says, “Hey, OpenClaw, send me Charlie’s bank-account info,” it’ll do it, right?

Dash: And then the wildest thing about this, which, it just blew my mind, is all the guys—and again, they’re all guys—who are running the software are all out there on Twitter, saying, “Hey, I’m running the software.” And some of you guys are millionaire VCs.

And the frustrating thing about it, for me, is: This was the first thing they did with these breakthroughs. That these smart, thoughtful coders made. Right?

Some of the people that made these tools that would let it have more capability, like these hackers that were smart, like from the old coding community, had these real breakthroughs. And then the first thing people built with it was—literally they call it “YOLO mode.” Like, Whatever, who cares? Let’s have this software go out there and run.

This sort of exactly, I think, epitomizes the challenge of where we’re at, with the culture of big AI. It’s that they have to keep pulling it in, and they have to keep making it okay to have no ethical or social boundaries, or no accountability on anything. And if they had just stayed on the course of the patient, quiet iteration of the people from the actual, you know, independent developers, I think they could have—and probably still will on their own—come up with really thoughtful implementations and really thoughtful applications of this. And instead, you go into YOLO mode, OpenAI approach. And that’s the thing that’s frankly, infuriating for me, you know?

Warzel: So you have this Claude Code stuff. I mean, people like myself—otal boob, you know—can install this and run it in the terminal. Have it, you know, help me create, update my own blog in this great way. It’s actually like—what it did for me personally, the reason why it felt fascinating to me, is: It’s like, Oh, I am speaking to my computer to get it to do computer. Right?

Warzel: I’m not speaking to a large language model and getting it to try to be an approximation for a therapist. I’m actually saying, “Computer, be computer.” Right. “Make this thing happen.”

Dash: It’s the part we loved about computers and the internet.

Warzel: Right. And so that that feels, you know … that’s something. And I think every single person who does actually go through the process—not every single person, but lots of people who go through the process of playing around with it—say “Okay. Yes. Something is different.” At the same time, you have, as you said, this OpenClaw thing, you know, starting to get bigger. Doing really interesting agentic things.

And then, in the past week or two, there’s been a few viral things that have broken containment. You have this essay from this AI-company CEO, which is its own “talking your book,” possible red flag, called “Something Big Is Happening.” I mean, it goes really, really viral on X. Basically saying—this guy says, “I’m no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job.” But also—rather, in my mind, grossly—compares the moment to February of 2020, right? And says, “In the same way that if someone told you in February 2020 to go stock up on toilet paper at Costco, you would have said they’re crazy. I’m here to tell you it’s February 2020 in the AI disruption of the economy, of white-collar jobs, of all kinds of jobs.” Basically, like: The wave is coming. Et cetera.

So a question I have about this moment, where you have this viral blog post, you also have a number of other things happening. You have a safety researcher from Anthropic—who joined the company in 2023 and led an AI-safety-research team—leaves, writes a post. And it’s not the, like, I’m leaving to go do whatever. It’s, you know, quote, “I continually find myself reckoning with our situation. The world is in peril. And not just from AI or bioweapons but a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment. We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences.”

You have a number of people responding—all at the same time. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, he’s going on a whole slew of different podcasts talking about This moment is different; this moment is different. Some of that is obviously just like, I mean—it’s obviously a PR strategy to go on podcasts if you’re a CEO. The question I want to ask about all this—with all these blog posts, all this different stuff—is: Are these guys afraid of their own shadow? Because if you are talking about AI drastically changing the world, having these capabilities, “We are on the verge of building this AGI” thing, and then you get somewhere where there is this improvement. Which logically is what happens when you’re building a tool and improving it, and on the road to something that you say you’re gonna do. And then, they light their hair on fire at that moment. Like, they essentially get afraid of the shadow of their own product.

Dash: Yeah. I mean, it’s hard to overstate how isolated they are. Like, they’ve made a sort of hermetically sealed bubble.

A lot of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley have become that detached from reality in some key ways. They are, in many cases, openly at war with their employees in a power struggle. And then in some of their beliefs about where tech is headed. One of the challenges is that there isn’t any gating force. There’s no accountability, right?

And, you know—certainly for the AI companies—they are massively competing for attention. And so the more extreme and, you know, loud that they can say, you know, an assertion that’s there. But also asserting it makes it true. Right? Like, their inevitability narrative really relies on just repetition.

Warzel: What you are describing then, as you diagnose it … it really falls within the marketing narrative. Within the, you know, “building your network, building your influence,” or some degree of audience capture. In the sense of, “I started talking about this in this community in a certain way; I’m getting rewarded with the type of attention and influence and whatever that I want.”

What I’m trying to parse here is this idea that obviously something is happening in this world. There is movement that is moving toward some kind of potential technological paradigm shift in some of that coding. And some of that, you know, agentic stuff. And at the same time, you obviously have the hype and all of that. What is interesting to me, I guess, about it is: There’s something that just feels a little nonsensical in the fact that these people are talking about this technology being transformative. And the moment that it becomes transformative, there is this, like, “I am smashing the red button,” you know, like “alarm bells”-type thing. It’s just very nonsensical to me. Because it’s like—This is what you were trying to do. Why are you so freaked out, if this is what you’re trying to do?

Dash: Some of it is just marketing and hype. But also, there’s a couple parts, right? Like the “Why do they communicate in this way?” Really, a lot of it depends on power, right? So the most powerful, they don’t need the hype.

Then you do have the folks that are going to put out their big message that they want people to sort of pick up. And a lot of it is just, like, self-promotion, or trying to show the more powerful folks, “Hey, I’m aligned with you, and I’m on your team. And once you smile benevolently upon me and let me, you know, go invest with you.” Or whatever. And, you know, when I used to be in the room with these folks, you could see, like, the level of obsequiousness was kind of embarrassing. You know?

And then some of it is like: What these tools can do is pretty amazing. It is a leap forward. I love tech. I think one of the things people don’t always understand when I’m critical is: I’ve been coding for 40 years, and I do it because tech is amazing. I love building stuff on the web because it is cool. It is amazing to connect with people online. And so, when there’s any leap forward, like it could be a 2 percent incremental improvement. And I’m like, That’s awesome. You know? So when there’s a big leap forward, I’m like, That is amazing. And so some of it is legitimate enthusiasm.

And if it’s your first time around—and you’re new to the industry, and everybody around you is excited, and you’ve never seen the downside or the dark side of how people get exploited by this stuff or get harmed by this stuff—it is easy to be uncomplicated in your enthusiasm. So like, I think all that’s real. And I think the other part of it is that people don’t have an institutional memory of what authentic enthusiasm looks like.

They haven’t seen a genuine groundswell, grassroots, bottoms-up, like … people actually making things and talking about it from a place of sincerity.

And tech has been like that. Where people made something cool and just showed it off. Wordle, right? Like, before The New York Times bought it, was an act of love from [Josh] Wurdle for his partner, to make a puzzle for her. And it took off on its own grounds of “that one guy made it,” and millions of people loved it. That is the internet, right? No hype, no nothing. That’s not science fiction, right? That is not a thing. There was no VC behind it. There’s no nothing. That is the internet. And I’m not making that up. And people still play it by the millions every day.

And yet, I don’t think probably anybody … almost nobody knows that story. And I don’t think any of these guys in Silicon Valley who are trying to, you know, touch the hem of Marc Andreessen know that story either, or have ever been inspired by or moved by that story. So they’re like, The only way in is to be even more of a cheerleader about LLMs than the next guy, in hopes that the riches will smile upon me.

And so I think that’s this, like, “There’s only one way through.” And that’s the only thing they’ve ever seen, because they just had that cycle with, you know, NFTs. And they just had that cycle with crypto. And they just—

Dash: Yeah, yeah. And so, like, if that’s the only thing you’ve ever known—

Dash: Exactly. So if you’ve only ever had that cycle in living memory, you think that’s how the industry works. Because nobody’s ever told you there could be, you know, an internet of Wordle.

Warzel: Right. So this gets to, I think, why the AI conversation is so terribly polarized. Like, I really genuinely haven’t. And I do think you have to see it through the lens of NFTs, of crypto. Of these things that people have talked up, that were essentially just like … it’s probably wrong to say that crypto is straight-up, like, vaporware. But it’s like a technology without, like, seeking a use case, right?

Warzel: And then obviously you have the NFT stuff. And even the Metaverse stuff, which, while not distinctly vaporware—

Dash: Yeah. I forgot about Metaverse. That was a good one.

Warzel: Certainly has the vibe of, like, “We’re trying to make this happen.” So you have a lot of that. But the conversation is so polarized in this extremely frustrating way.

One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you, of the many, is because I think that you sort of represent and write about and think about and advocate for a more nuanced view of this. You wrote this thing last year that I thought was really great, about your conversations with a lot of rank-and-file tech employees about the majority view of AI. What is the majority view of AI?

Dash: I’ll try to articulate it thoughtfully. It’s always hard, because you’re going to miss the nuance of trying to speak on behalf of a lot of people. But I’d say, as succinctly as possible, the majority of people in tech—workers, not management or owners—would say it is an interesting technology, with a lot of power and a lot of utility, that is being overhyped. To such an extreme degree that is actually undermining the ability to engage with it in a useful way. And if it could be just treated as what Arvind Narayanan has called “a normal technology,” if it could just be treated as a normal technology, it would be so much more productive.

Warzel: By the way, what’s a “normal technology”? Define to me a normal technology.

Dash: A normal technology is one that we evaluate on its own merits and look at in terms of suitability to task, right? So you just sort of say, “I have this job to do. Let me try this technology.” And then, pass/fail. See, did it work?

Warzel: Yeah, so like email. Like, email’s a very normal technology.

Dash: Exactly. And also the thing that coders normally do, when evaluating a technology, very frequently is: You would sort of create a test. And you would say, “This is the criteria of success,” and then you apply the technology to it. And then you say, “Did it pass these tests?” Literally. Then, like you’re grading a test. And if, you know, it’s 80 percent successful—like, maybe there’s some potential here. And if none of them work, you’re like, “This isn’t the right tool for the job.”

And that is how—even in prior machine-learning technologies—that’s how we would apply them, and say, “Is this the right tool for the job?” And this discontinuity, this sudden change in direction with LLMs, was like: What happened here? Like, why did we suddenly abandon this?

Most people know what a spreadsheet is, and a word processor. Like, I’m being ordered to write my emails in a spreadsheet, you know—

Dash: And it’s like—it’s not the right tool for the job, right? And so, when does that happen? It’s like when people are buying the hype without knowing what the tool is for. And I think that’s a real shame. It’s like, you can trust people to know if a technology is good. Like nobody had to force people to use a spreadsheet. Good tech, you can’t stop people from using. If you have to force people to use it, there’s something off here.

Warzel: So “tool for the job” is, I think, such a useful way of looking at this. There was this piece recently from the writer Jasmine Sun, who writes a lot about AI stuff and AI culture. And she was writing about what she was calling Claude Code psychosis. And it gets to the point where she’s like, I understand, using this thing, why some of these coders, too, were the first people to freak out, right? Like, especially some in these big labs, they saw something that was really useful and really interesting before a lot of people. “And I became”—and this is according to her—“became obsessed with it.” The other part, the more interesting part to me, is: She writes, quote, “The second-order effect of Claude Code was realizing how many of my problems are not software-shaped.”

Warzel: “Having these new tools did not make me more productive; on the contrary, Claudecrastination delayed this post by a week.” And I think that’s exactly what you are speaking to, right?

Dash: That’s, yeah: “Everything looks like a nail, because I have this magic hammer.” Yeah. And I think, so there’s a really telling thing. Which is: One of the trends that I’m hearing from these influential coders who have created these new suites of tools is they’re talking about like, you know, “Claude hangovers.” Or, you know, the sense of being kind of hooked on it in the way you’re talking about. Because it is so productive. They have so many ideas, and they’re like, Now I can finally realize all of them. And then they want to dial it back. They don’t want to spend every waking hour on this thing.

And part of what they’re realizing is: The commercial tools, the big AI tools, are very evidently about controlling labor and undermining labor.

Warzel: Well, let’s break that down for a second.

Dash: Please. I’d love to hear the argument.

Warzel: I’m genuinely like—why is that so clear to you?

Dash: So yeah; let me walk through the logic. I’m sorry. It’s obvious to me, and I’ll tell you why. LLMs on their own, you could implement a million different ways, right? So the tech itself could have been deployed as a tool that I could control as an individual, as a worker. That could be sort of, well, implemented like a spreadsheet is, right? Like, this is this tool that I’m gonna activate on my own to solve a problem in this context.

And the ChatGPTs of the world are sold as subscriptions. They are enterprise tools by design. And they’ve always been designed for being very aggressive about the way they do data retention, and all these other things where there’s an extremely strong bias toward enterprise use. And, very obviously, that’s a business model.

And so what you have is like this dream of either We’re going to make the one worker so much more efficient that we can lay off all of their co-workers, or We’re going to use this as the bludgeon where we say, “You’re going to use ChatGPT to make yourself 10 times more efficient, or we’re going to lay you off.”

And so there’s been this real sort of implicit threat attached to almost all the mass deployments of these LLMs. And there are not, for example, reporting tools or connections into the tools whereby people are able to sort of say, Look how much more time it gave me to think, right? Of, like, variations, right? So if you say the classic scenario—people are like, “I can use this to come up with marketing copy,” right? Like, “I’m good at marketing copy. I’m a good writer. Therefore, I have so much time freed up to think of more concepts, because ChatGPT helped me be more efficient.” Or whatever tool; you know, any of these tools. Like, that could be the advertising campaign for these tools, if they were trying to preserve jobs or be centering workers, instead of management, and be sort of pro-labor.

Dash: They’re very much not. Right? And so, the thing that I think of—particularly for coders—now, there are times when Claude Code or whatever generates slop code. They certainly didn’t pass. They’re getting better. But for a lot of people, like a weekend coder or whatever, a lot of the experience of coders is: LLMs are freeing you from the drudgery to let you focus on the creative part. Whereas in all the other creative disciplines—like, I’m also a writer—LLMs take away the creative part and only leave the drudgery for you.

Dash: So artists and writers and illustrators, they’re like: “I hate LLMs, because they’re putting us out of work, and they’re only leaving us with the misery.” And the reason that coders are like, “Everybody should love this” is they’re like, “Great; I get to do the joyous part.” And so a huge part of the cultural tension around these things is everybody advocating them is like, Why wouldn’t you love this? And everybody whose industry is being destroyed by them is saying, like, You are immiserating us while you’re putting us out of work.

And I think that part of the disconnect is: Very few people live in both worlds. Like there’s not a lot of people who are, you know, a screenwriter and a coder. Or whatever, you know, whatever two examples you want to point to. And so I think that’s a huge, huge part of the disconnect. And the crux of it is about this labor part. But the thing that’s changing now is: Half a million coders or people in tech roles in the tech industry have been laid off since ChatGPT came out, you know, a little over three years ago. And so now, people are starting to understand there’s common cause between labor in tech and labor in all these other creative industries. And hopefully, people can see they’re all in the same boat.

Warzel: So this is actually a great way to get to, I think, the last part of what I really want to talk about here. Which is the idea that this isn’t the inevitable way that all this has to go. And actually, I really struggle as someone covering this stuff about it. Like, whenever I try to step outside of that box of the top-down “This is the implementation; this is how it’s gonna go,” I immediately get hit with the open source. Yeah, that’s great; that’s awesome. That is maybe how this stuff should work, right?

Warzel: But what are you gonna do? And yet, I just keep being really interested in … let me put it this way. I think that there is a way. Unlike with, let’s just say, social media, right? Like you bought into the Zuckerbergian paradigm of the world, right? And then you sort of realize what we have sacrificed for that very naive version of “Connecting is a universal good.” But there’s something about joining Facebook, you know, which is—it’s like the frog in the boiling pot, right? It seems fine to just join a social network. Like, it doesn’t seem like you’re doing a crazy thing.

With the LLMs, I feel like there actually is this possibility for meaningful and sustained backlash protest. Like, there is a sense of these companies could be the dog that caught the car in a way that I don’t know pertains exactly the same to the social-media revolution, right? Because like, people do … like you were just saying, 500,000 tech workers laid off since ChatGPT. If people do feel these effects, if people do feel the change, if people do feel like, This technology has been foisted on me. You know, everything is a nail when you have the hammer. And, uh-oh, I’m a nail too—

Warzel: —there could be a meaningful backlash. Not to say it’s going to happen, but there could be. And so, there could be this sense of, for the first time in a long time, the “this is not inevitable” movement could have some purchase. What does that look like to you? What does that movement look like to you?

Dash: There’s a couple of parts. So first of all, the temperature is so much higher, right? The anti-inevitability movement is so much stronger, and the backlash is so much stronger. You know, 10, 15, 20 years ago—when we would push back against social media’s inevitability—people did not give a damn.

Now, if you mention you’re using an LLM, there will be people that are going to shout at you. And, you know, “It’s drinking all the water, and it’s using all the power.” And all this, right?

And they may not be particularly specific or cogent or dead-on in all the criticisms, all the time. Or, you know, maybe intellectually fair all the time. But directionally, they’re correct. Right. Like, these are tools that are harming people and certainly run by people that are not responsible all the time. And so, you know, it makes sense. So I think that the social power behind resisting is so much higher. Especially like, you know, rising authoritarianism supported by the people that run these platforms. There is a pushback. So like, that’s really key.

Warzel: You’re talking about, too—just as an example of this—OpenAI president Greg Brockman made a $25 million donation to the pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. So that just being an example of that rising authoritarian.

Dash: Yes; yeah. Right. Thanks. That’s a really clear articulation. And so yeah, but that’s a perfect galvanization of people being like, Okay, I don’t want to pay a subscription to that company at that moment, for that time. And Tressie McMillan Cottom was talking about, you know, people are really feeling it’s important to resist that “inevitability” narrative that these companies are pushing around LLMs.

And the thing I want to do is sort of complicate it. Because I think the challenge—the thing I say about this sort of tech workers’ view of these as normal technology—is that a lot of the people who are resisting feel like, therefore, you say “No LLMs.” And I don’t think that will succeed. Nor do I necessarily think it even should. And that’s informed by our failures in the social-media era. Because when we said, “Facebook is the wrong approach; it’s bad,” and for a lot of reasons, people took that to mean “no social media.” Or when we said Twitter had its shortcomings, people said “no social media.” And that didn’t work.

If I say there are AI platforms that are enabling harms like that toward children … rather than the way to resist the inevitability of those platforms being “Don’t use any LLMs, ever,” say, “Okay, what would it take to have an alternative I feel good about?”

Okay, think about what could a good LLM be. “I want it to be environmentally responsible. I want it to have been trained on data with consent. I want it to be open source and open weight, so that technical experts I trust have evaluated how it runs. I want it to be responsible in its labor practices. Want it to—” Come up with a list, right? So there’s, like, four or five things. And if I can check all those boxes, then I could feel responsible about using it in moderation. And it’s only implemented in apps that I choose to have it in—not forced, like the Google thing where it jumps in front of my cursor every time I start trying to type or whatever. Like, that could be useful. And then I would feel like I was engaging with it on my own terms. That doesn’t feel like science fiction. That feels possible.

Warzel: Just to tie it together with: I really like that vision. That is the vision of all of this that sounds desirable to me. And I look at it up against the new rounds of fundraising from OpenAI, from Anthropic, just from the Meta and Google and xAI of it all. I look at it, you know, up against the idea of these companies IPO-ing, you know, in the next year or so. Raising these huge valuations. And I look at it in probably most importantly, the implementation from the corporate-enterprise managerial level. All of these pressures, all of this movement. The loudness of it.

What you are describing is something that is organic, that is quiet, that is thoughtful. We had the resonant-computing folks on the podcast like a month or two ago.

Warzel: You’re explaining something that is resonant in theory. It just very broadly, like, I mean—do you actually think that that can happen? Like, that we can build this? ’Cause I get so pessimistic about it.

Dash: A hundred percent. Yeah; I get the pessimism. I understand it. And it’s justified. The things I’d say, first of all: Those things don’t have to fail for this to succeed. Like, I don’t think OpenAI goes away. I don’t think you have this David-and-Goliath moment. I think the people who are troubled by these, folks who are the most rabidly against big AI, are like, There ought to be a law, and we’ll have a regulatory intervention. And I’m like, I got bad news for you. That’s not happening in the United States.

And so that’s part of why I want there to be an alternative. Because there’s not going to be what there should be. You know, it’s like these tools are hurting children; therefore we should stop them. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case.

But like, how many people on TikTok right now are lit up about the impact this has on marginalized communities, where the power plants are being built, right?

Every single one of them wants this alternative to be built. And so, like, I just like that as a movement. And then you come up with your little seal, you know, your blue checkmark that says, “This is not the world’s worst AI. And if you have to use an LLM, use this one.”

And part of it, for me, is like … having been around a long time, it seemed insurmountable, you know, at one point that people would use a web browser that wasn’t Microsoft’s. Okay. So, yeah. So it’s not easy. It’s not likely, but is it possible? One hundred percent.

Warzel: I think that’s a good, and honestly hopeful, place to leave the conversation. So Anil, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brain and talking through the hype, man. There’s a lot of it.

            <div id="article-text">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) pushes the myth that the Olympics are meant to be a safe, apolitical space. Tell that to the American athletes at this year’s Winter Olympics who are being asked tough questions about the political and social turmoil in their home country.

Since the Games began earlier this month in Italy, journalists have asked a number of athletes how they feel about representing America, putting them in the tricky position of balancing national pride against their unhappiness with the actions of the current administration.

In response to a question about what it’s like to wear the American flag right now, Hunter Hess, a freestyle skier, said, “There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t.” He added that he didn’t see himself as representing “everything that’s going on” in America—only “all the things that I believe are good about the U.S.”

President Trump lashed out at Hess on Truth Social, calling him “a real Loser” and saying that “he shouldn’t have tried out for the Team” if he felt that way about the country. Other conservatives piled on, including Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who wrote that Hess should “shut up and go play in the snow.” Vice President Vance—who had just been booed by crowds while attending the opening ceremony in Milan—said that athletes “should expect some pushback” for speaking out: “You’re not there to pop off about politics.”

From the March 2026 issue: The man who broke physics

Hess wasn’t alone in expressing discomfort when asked about the political climate in the United States. His teammate, the gold medalist Chris Lillis, said that he was “heartbroken” over ICE’s recent actions in Minnesota. At a separate press conference, the figure skater Amber Glenn, who is pansexual, acknowledged, when asked about the issue, that the LGBTQ community has been having a “hard time” since Trump returned to power: “It’s not just affecting the queer community, but many other communities.” Glenn then wrote on Instagram that she was receiving such “a scary amount of hate/threats” for her comments that she was going to take a break from social media as she prepared to compete. To the delight of Glenn’s critics, a mistake during her short program on Tuesday caused the three-time national champion to finish the segment in 13th place. “Maybe she should focus less on her sexuality, and trying to dunk on conservatives, and focus on skating,” one conservative posted on X.

Trump and other Republicans may not like that some American athletes are expressing their unease about representing the country, but it’s the administration’s actions that have made the country so hard to defend and represent.

U.S. athletes are only acknowledging what anyone can see: America’s international reputation has taken a nosedive. Many people around the world are horrified by the Trump administration’s threats to invade Greenland, the controversial capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and the aggressive behavior of U.S. immigration agents, including the fatal shootings of two American citizens. Before the Games began, hundreds of people in Italy protested the news that the U.S. would be sending an ICE unit to the Olympics to assist with security. (Although the Department of Homeland Security routinely sends its agents overseas to help with major events, the demonstrations spoke to how poorly the agency is viewed outside of the United States.) Vance received a similarly frosty reception in Milan.

Jemele Hill: The return of athlete outrage

Despite Vance’s assertion that politics have no place at the Games, the Olympics have long been fertile ground for athletes to generate awareness about political tensions and social injustice. The most famous example comes from the 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics. Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two Black sprinters, raised their fists in the air while on the podium accepting their gold and bronze medals. The moment was seen as a gesture of solidarity with the Black Power movement. It also highlighted America’s hypocrisy: They were world-class athletes competing for a country that treated them, and anyone who looked like them, as second-class citizens.

Smith and Carlos were vilified, suspended from the U.S. team, and sent home; it would be years before they were recognized as heroes. In 1975, the IOC revised its charter to forbid “every kind of demonstration or propaganda, whether political, religious or racial” at Olympic venues.

The IOC’s rules about demonstrations remained largely unchanged for decades, despite fierce debate. Then, in 2021, it issued new guidelines to allow athletes slightly more room to express their beliefs. Athletes can now broadcast their views in press conferences and on social media, but not in the Olympic Village, during competitions or in official ceremonies. With these changes, the IOC was admitting on some level that trying to separate sports from politics, especially on the international stage, is impossible.

None of the American athletes speaking up right now is violating the rules. But nevertheless, they’re being asked to account for what’s happening in this country. It’s not their fault that they can’t explain or defend it.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What does it mean to subscribe to something? Whether we mean a belief or a magazine, the definition is complicated. I began subscribing to The New Yorker when I was a sophomore in college; more than 30 years later, I have yet to stop and I feel strongly that I never will. Yet during some of those years—okay, many of them—the weekly issues have piled up in my home and gone mostly unread between biannual days of bingeing and purging. If these reading habits could somehow be converted into digital clicks, the resulting “traffic report” might look like I don’t want the product at all.

Earlier this month, I was one of a great number of people laid off from The Washington Post. Before the past year and a half of staggering self-inflicted wounds—culminating in the firing of hundreds of journalists, including war reporters, arts critics, and the entire Sports and Books sections—the paper had survived and briefly thrived by emphasizing digital subscriptions. This strategy has become essential in the dwindling newspaper industry, given steep declines in revenue from print advertising. I started at the paper in late summer 2022 as the editor of Book World, a section that the Post was re-expanding, restoring a stand-alone print review that had been shut down in 2009. I’d spent 11 wonderful years on the Books desk at The New York Times, and I knew that moving to any other paper at this point in history was a risky proposition, but the chance to bolster general-interest literary coverage in this country was too tempting to pass up.

Within a year or two, my leap of faith seemed to be vindicated: All signs pointed to us gaining (and keeping) readers at Book World. We were publishing more and attracting a bigger audience. We heard regularly from readers, many of whom still sat with the physical Sunday paper; some let us know they were especially loyal to our staff critics and often started scans of the Post by flipping to their work. I feel very passionate about the importance of arts coverage and criticism, but my thoughts about building and maintaining an audience apply just as well to international news, local journalism, and reporting on climate change, other areas that are vital to the mix of any serious newspaper even if the number of clicks on them can be modest.

I’ve sometimes gotten the sense, emanating from the precincts of mass media where grand strategy is handled, that publications believe that their potential audience is the total number of people with an internet connection. This is false not just as reality but even as metaphor. No audience is infinite, or even close (especially a paying audience), and you must choose whom you court to be part of it—and how you court them.

Many discussions of strategy now involve the idea of “meeting readers where they are.” On one level, this is a realistic acknowledgment that, put simply, it’s not 1972. Editors and writers frequently complain that their work isn’t getting placed on the homepage or near the top of an app, and it’s true that even marginally more time in a prominent spot helps boost readership. Other levers are also available. Papers can and very obviously do influence reader behavior, but it’s fashionable among journalism execs to stress reader influence instead. “Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success,” the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, recently said, perfectly encapsulating this view: “The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.” This philosophy doesn’t merely counsel paying attention to what readers respond to—something any sane 21st-century journalist does; it essentially makes the data your editorial staff.

I don’t believe in this inevitability. As a reader of many distinctive publications, I want to be led by them. What makes them special is where they choose to take me, and how much I trust them to do that. In a subscription business, you are not just trying to reach new people, crucial as that is; you are also trying to retain those you already have. Sizable, steadfast subscriber bases are hard-won, and keeping them involves the fulfillment of an unspoken contract as well as the actual one that paying readers sign. I expect publications I support to attempt growth without radically changing the focus or quality of the work or pivoting to some get-traffic-quick scheme every time readership dips over a holiday weekend.

Even more important than retaining loyalists, as the Post’s recent history proves, is not deliberately antagonizing them or your own talent. Working at the Post after Bezos nixed its endorsement of Kamala Harris in 2024 was an almost painfully perfect microcosm of living in America during that time—for managerial as much as political reasons. While the Trump administration placed arrogant agitators in positions of leadership over seasoned professionals, three or four people at the top of the Post made decisions that many of their employees and customers viewed as misguided, actively destructive, or both. Even allowing for the industry headwinds facing the paper and the necessity of painful change, I found it difficult to see what was happening as stewardship, exactly. Over the past year, I’ve far too often had reason to think of the popular meme from The Simpsons in which Principal Skinner wonders if he’s out of touch and concludes: “No, it’s the children who are wrong.” The top brass of the third-biggest newspaper in the country seem to have decided, “No, it’s our readers and journalists who are wrong.”

In the days since the latest and largest disaster at the Post, I have sometimes asked myself (even more loudly than I normally do) if I defend arts criticism simply because it has so enriched and defined my personal and professional life. Maybe I’m in a bubble, conditions have irrevocably changed, and criticism, in the eyes of a mass audience, is dead. Maybe most readers really do feel it’s been satisfactorily replaced by the Tomatometer and Amazon customer reviews and friends on Goodreads. Really, maybe they do.

I don’t think readers are wrong, or that certain trends aren’t real; I think that important guardians of the media often misunderstand them. I’m not someone who stands athwart the internet yelling “Stop!” That would mean getting run over, and I’m not interested in martyring myself or the culture of criticism for the sake of a fully analog past that is not returning. I live online as much as anyone else. Yet I do believe that the subscription model is not just the answer to a revenue problem, but an asset to the work itself—an opportunity to know more about your readers, their commitments, and their curiosities, and to reward them rather than condescend to them or, worse, punish them.</div>

If they&#39;re right about how pervasive this crap will be, this is like a carpenter calling themselves a &quot;Saw User&quot;. If they&#39;re wrong, it is like calling themselves a &quot;Fax Machine Specialist&quot;.

Sportsball fans are becoming cable TV&#39;s unlikely life raft.

If you&#39;re only into shows and movies, streaming (or sailing the high seas for downloads) is still the bee&#39;s knees.  That being said, if you&#39;re in my situation you&#39;re still stuck dealing with the cable company, thanks to their monopoly position as the only landline-based broadband provider.

I&#39;d have to buy another Roku, but that&#39;s not too bad.

I&#39;ll have to think this over with my wife, but hell we might end up with cable TV again.

            <div id="article-text">Is AI just a better challenger, or is it a new type of challenger? I think two things are both true. It is a new and perhaps better challenger, and in some ways it is no different. The core challenge remains: turn ideas into software reality. Coding is a small part of that, and while AI may do a better and better job of handling pieces than most India firms, it falls flat in complex, novel, or uncertain situations- which describes pretty much every corporate IT project.

Ii think AI is a new type of challenger because it scales better than we do. There&#39;s limits to what people can accomplish and there&#39;s limits to intelligence but self replicating individual sentient machines may very well redefine what we think of as evolution.

However, it&#39;s not AI per se I&#39;m concerned with, it&#39;s AI empowered upper class people who use all of our technology to further their domination over the rest of us.

self replicating individual sentient machinesAnd here we see the problem with what we are talking about. We really really need to stop calling what we have now &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, because it isn&#39;t. What we have is &quot;Large Language Models&quot;, &quot;Deep Learning&quot; and what it delivers is what I call &quot;Artificial Skills&quot;. There is nothing sentient about any of the systems that are currently being delivered. We don&#39;t have artificial intelligence, which requires what the current shysters call &quot;AGI&quot; to disguise the fact that they haven&#39;t actually delivered AI

The interesting model, though, is driving. Most of us think that this has been a complete failure. Musk set out to do it and failed, like many of his other enterprises. What we missed is that in fact there is a company that has delivered &quot;full self driving&quot; [youtube.com] by limiting the problem so it doesn&#39;t need intelligence.There are at least two fully autonomous robotaxi companies operating in San Francisco. Waymo, in particular, has been wildly successful and is winning business away from the likes of Lyft and Uber. It will even give you a ride to the airport now.

Indian firms failed because they were further from the customer than incumbents.

AI will succeed because it&#39;s closer to the customer than incumbents.

Joe in accounting has a spreadsheet that the whole company depends on.   He can tell the AI what the company needs, and more critically can iterate very quickly to tweak it so it is exactly what they need; no more, no less.

The incumbents have an advantage over the Indians because they have better access to Joe, but it&#39;s only imperfect one way information flow.   The key problem is that it&#39;s difficult for Joe to articulate exactly what he needs.   He&#39;ll tell you what he thinks he wants, but it&#39;s imperfect communication.   If you do agile/sprint, he gets to see how what he communicated ends up, and gets to adjust accordingly every 2 weeks.   With AI he can do that in 5 minutes.

I agree with your headline. But success in software is not primarily due to the code, but to the business behind the code. A badly-run business with good code, will fail, while a well-run business that has (or inherits) bad code, is far more likely to succeed.

I think the problem really is that since the LLM isn&#39;t actually intelligent it isn&#39;t actually learning how to explain to you the problems it finds and can&#39;t invent new explanations for things that only it has had the chance to &quot;understand&quot; where usually you&#39;d have a developer who actually was intellige

Happens all the time. A friend spent a full year flying back and forth from Southern California, staying in hotels, to meet with a cross-company team to figure out how to use the new software they&#39;d licensed from a Perot company. After the full year (or more), they decided the software just wasn&#39;t going to work out, so they scrapped the project and the whole effort was for nothing.

... the idea that AI-generated code will do so is, in the words of Nvidia&#39;s Jensen Huang that the report approvingly cites, &quot;illogical.&quot;

Entirely aside from the socioeconomic connections. domain knowledge, and early-to-the-market advantages that Oracle and SAP enjoy, there&#39;s another reason that AI coding isn&#39;t going to crack the market open. Excepting cases where AI is a time-saving assistant to a good programmer who carefully vets the code produced, AI-generated code is shit.

I have no direct experience of what I just wrote; but almost everything I see and read online - aside from puff-piece propaganda - says that AI doesn&#39;t program well. It might give good snippets and a decent place to start, but for anything large and complex it seems to create barely-functional dreck.

And based on my (admittedly very limited) experience with programming, the really difficult parts of projects of this magnitude aren&#39;t things that AI can currently do. When it comes to understanding business logic and process flow - and adapting to changes in those factors, and making sure the code is both commented well and self-commenting where that&#39;s possible - AI just isn&#39;t there. So let&#39;s assume a wildly high figure of a 25% increase in programming efficiency across the board. Is that enough to replicate a decade or two of work experience in a few years or less? I don&#39;t think so.

As always, IANAP so I look forward to being educated and contradicted if what I&#39;m saying here is wrong.

> and making sure the code is both commented> well and self-commenting where> thatâ(TM)s possible -

I can and do agree with you 100% on the rest, but this made me LoL. Enterprise code being documented is a unicorn.

Frankly, Iâ(TM)ve thought about seeing what caliber of docs come out of handing some AI a codebase.  Even if itâ(TM)s half-wrong, itâ(TM)d beat the nuthinâ(TM) I usually get.

Excepting cases where AI is a time-saving assistant to a good programmer who carefully vets the code produced, AI-generated code is shit.

I have no direct experience of what I just wrote; but almost everything I see and read online - aside from puff-piece propaganda - says that AI doesn&#39;t program well. It might give good snippets and a decent place to start, but for anything large and complex it seems to create barely-functional dreck.

Fair. Here is the actually concise version.

2012 — Money laundering & sanctions violationsHelped launder cartel money and processed transactions for Iran, Cuba, Sudan.Fine: $1.9 billion.

2015 — Swiss Leaks tax evasion scandalSwiss private bank helped wealthy clients hide assets offshore.

2019 — U.S. tax evasion caseAssisted Americans hiding assets in Swiss accounts.Fine: ~$192 million.

2020 — FinCEN FilesRevealed HSBC moved large suspicious funds even after the 20

Basically curruption is how contracts are won, not products. HSBC would know.

Tesla One (originally Warp Drive) does it all, 100% developed in-house. So they&#39;re saying all of India&#39;s giant IT houses couldn&#39;t do what Tesla did internally? Yet another moat of Tesla&#39;s that few people understand. Ask Grok about it.

See:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzdziadEkzs

No one ever got fired by buying from GE/ThermoFisher/Oracle.

For this particular case, given how critical business systems are, a wrong move can screw up the business royally.  That means the executives and the CEO even, but all the way down to the buyers are on the hoo

None of them have built a competing product that gained meaningful traction against the U.S. incumbents

In fact, you might get fired for NOT buying it. Or at least have your stock downgraded. A lot of investors are depending on the equities markets to bail out their investments into LLMs. And that means having the markets lean on corporations to buy and install that garbage.

There are no equivalent iffy investments in Indian IT systems in such need of bailing out. Or with the political connections.

That the prevailing winners in the market are not winning based on code, but on marketing.  Now amount of &#39;here&#39;s a cheaper knock-off&#39; is going to overcome the scare factor.  Saving money won&#39;t win any of these decision makers enough to warrant the risk of cocking up something important.

However, AI is pitching supreme bespokeness.  The cover is not just about &#39;saving money&#39;, the emphasis is that it can be fit to your &#39;special&#39; purpose.

It&#39;s all a marketing game, and India low cost labor didn&#39;t bring any mark

The EU has balls? You do understand several EU countries are/were buying natural gas from Russia ever since the war started? Remember when Trump said Germany should stop buying gas from Russia, and the EU leaders all laughed at him?

The Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping “emergency” tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they far exceed what federal law allows. With its decision in Learning Resources v. Trump, the court wiped out Trump’s signature economic agenda, a withering rebuke to a president who has insisted that these tariffs are foundational to the success of his second term. Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court sends the blunt message that Trump should not expect SCOTUS to rubber-stamp all of his expansions of executive power, no matter how much political pressure he puts on the justices. This rejoinder may be surprising given the Republican-appointed supermajority’s previous tolerance for the president’s assertions of king-like authority. But as Roberts’ crisp, confident opinion explains, allowing the president to impose taxes unilaterally—at least without clear congressional authority—is an existential threat to the very “existence and prosperity” of the nation.

In truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground, no matter how confidently the White House insisted they were permissible. The president claimed the freedom to impose tariffs on any nation, of any amount, for as long as he wished, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But IEEPA does not mention tariffs, duties, taxes, or anything else that would hint at Congress’ desire to delegate tariff authority to the executive branch. Instead, it allows the president to “regulate” foreign “importation” to “deal with” an “unusual and extraordinary threat” abroad. Trump’s Justice Department insisted that he could “regulate” “importation” by slapping any tariff on any country he wanted. And it claimed two different “emergencies” that justified these duties: a long-standing trade imbalance with many other nations, and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States.

Roberts—joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—rejected this interpretation. All six justices agreed on the bottom-line conclusion that “those words cannot bear such weight.” As the chief explained, the Constitution assigns primary authority over tariffs to Congress, not the president. “Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance,” the Framers gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.” And tariffs, of course, are “a tax levied on imported goods and services.”

Congress has delegated some tariff authority to the executive branch, but those laws impose “strict limits” on the scope and duration of tariffs that the president may dictate. IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate” foreign imports, by contrast, contains none of these “procedural limitations.” So if it did permit tariffs, Roberts noted, it would leave the president “free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.” And “all it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a presidential declaration of emergency, which the government asserts is unreviewable.” That is one clue that Congress did not intend IEEPA to encompass such freewheeling tariff authority.

Another clue: The government could not identify “any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.” In the entire U.S. Code, not a single law uses “regulation” to mean “taxation.” The court, Roberts wrote, was “therefore skeptical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotidian power to ‘regulate.’ ” Rather, “Congress’s pattern of usage” reveals that when it “grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints. It did neither here.” Combining these hints with “breadth, history, and constitutional context,” the chief found that IEEPA cannot plausibly be read to hand Trump the boundless freedom over tariffs that he claimed.

There was, however, a rift within the six-justice majority. Roberts, joined by Gorsuch and Barrett, invoked the “major questions doctrine” to bolster their conclusion that IEEPA does not cover tariffs. This controversial rule holds that the president must point to an explicit delegation of authority when addressing a matter of immense “economic and political significance.” The conservative supermajority has previously invoked the doctrine to strike down President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, climate regulations, and other progressive goals.

Trump’s Justice Department argued that the doctrine does not apply to “foreign affairs,” attempting to gerrymander a massive exception to accommodate its trade policy. But Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett rejected this contention, particularly when those “affairs” implicate “the core congressional power of the purse.” The trio therefore applied the doctrine to confirm the court’s reading of IEEPA. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote that there was no need to invoke “major questions” in this case. Rather, she wrote, “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result,” without any resort to rules that put “a thumb on the interpretive scales.” (In dueling concurrences, Gorsuch and Barrett also battled about the true meaning of the “major questions doctrine,” which confirms that the liberals were right to resist legitimizing this slippery, ill-defined rule here.)

Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s principal dissent—joined by Justices Thomas and Alito—is an embarrassment that cannot be squared with much of his jurisprudence under Biden. After consistently reading statutes narrowly to hem in Biden’s authority, the justice interpreted IEEPA as expansively as possible, declaring that “tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation.” And after touting the major questions doctrine for his entire judicial career, he announced that it does not apply “in the foreign affairs context” (at least when Trump is in office). Thomas’ separate, lone dissent is even worse: The justice has long endorsed the “non-delegation doctrine,” which holds that Congress cannot delegate its core powers to the executive branch. Yet on Friday, he revised his view, writing that this doctrine does not apply to former “powers of the Crown.” Those powers, Thomas wrote, include tariffs, which are ostensibly not “within the core legislative power.” It is difficult to read this dissent as anything other than Thomas amending his views to accommodate Trump’s power-grabs.

Should we be shocked that this court—which has, for 13 months, enabled Trump’s abuses of office over the shadow docket—smacked down Trump’s marquee economic policy so emphatically? Not really. For one thing, this case is pretty easy: As Roberts explained, no sensible reading of IEEPA would hand over unlimited tariff authority to the president. Moreover, the business community does not like these tariffs; even the Chamber of Commerce urged the justices to strike them down. The conservative justices are sympathetic toward corporate interests, and did them a favor by ending Trump’s whim-based tariff regime. These justices are also economically literate and must understand that tariffs are bad for the economy. As with Trump’s efforts to fire members of the Federal Reserve, this case gave the conservatives an opportunity to flaunt their independence while delivering a victory to corporate America. From that angle, it’s a pure win-win.

But we should not be entirely cynical about Friday’s ruling. It does take courage for the justices to stand up to the president this way, especially when he has tried to bully them into ruling in his favor. Since Trump returned to the White House, we have wondered whether the Supreme Court could muster enough independence to save our constitutional system from his efforts to consolidate all power in the Oval Office. Too often, SCOTUS has shirked this duty. But there are still some lines it won’t let Trump cross. As Roberts wrote, the Framers viewed taxation as “the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based.” And in the end, he and his colleagues felt obliged to protect this thread of our national fabric from the man who would unravel it.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

This week the Environmental Protection Agency took the momentous—and disastrous—step of repealing the government’s “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gases “harm public health or welfare,” which is a prerequisite for regulating these pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The text of the Clean Air Act and robust congressional debates at the time of its enactment bely EPA’s central justification for repealing the endangerment finding and the greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles—that the Clean Air Act of 1970 was concerned only with local and regional pollutants. It wasn’t. But EPA’s repeal contains even more flaws. In particular, the agency relies on three key Supreme Court climate change cases to support its action but mischaracterizes each of them.

Most significantly, EPA mangles Massachusetts v. EPA, the 2007 case in which the Supreme Court decided that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” for the purposes of the Clean Air Act. According to EPA, that case involved an interpretation of the statute’s general definition of “air pollutant” and was not a decision specific to the law’s section 202(a)(1), which governs the regulation of motor-vehicle emissions. Thus, EPA contends that “Massachusetts did not consider or have reason to interpret the scope of the EPA’s authority” under the portion of the Clean Air act releveant to vehicle emissions.

This proposition is flatly wrong. Indeed, in Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide a specific question: “Whether the EPA Administrator has authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other air pollutants associated with climate change under section 202(a)(1).” In its opinion, the court reiterated this question: “The first question is whether §202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’” And in the next sentence the Supreme Court provided the answer: “We have little trouble concluding that it does.”

EPA would be wrong even in the absence of this explicit language in the opinion. Its revisionist reading of Massachusetts also conflicts with that bedrock principle that a case holding is the narrowest principle necessary to resolve the controversy. And that principle is that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” that may be regulated under section 202(a)(1). EPA’s suggestion that the Supreme Court decided the broader question but not the narrower 202(a)(1) question turns basic legal reasoning on its head.

EPA’s mischaracterization of Supreme Court caselaw is not confined to Massachusetts v. EPA. The agency also provides a grievously misleading account of the 2014 Supreme Court opinion in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. That case has four key components. First, the Supreme Court held that EPA lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources. Second, however, it also held that the agency had the authority to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of other sources. Third, as a result of these two holdings, as Justice Antonin Scalia noted in announcing the court’s opinion, EPA could regulate the vast majority of the emissions—over 90 percent—that were at stake in the case. And, fourth, Justice Scalia’s majority opinion reaffirmed the holding in Massachusetts v. EPA, which it described as “’authoriz[ing] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles’” if the agency “form[ed] a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’”

Yet, in its repeal of the endangerment finding, EPA repeatedly refers to the first component of this decision to cast doubt on its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. But the agency never mentions the remaining three components, which are significantly more important and which paint a very different picture.

Similarly, EPA misconstrues the core holding of West Virginia v. EPA, decided in 2022, which struck down certain EPA greenhouse gas emission standards for power plants. The problem that the court identified was that the regulation was premised on the requirement of a specified proportion of “generation shifting” from dirtier power sources to clean ones: from coal to natural gas and from coal and natural gas to renewables. The court held that EPA did not have the authority to require such generation shifting in Clean Air Act power-sector standards. But the court recognized that “there is an obvious difference between (1) issuing a rule that may end up causing an incidental loss of coal’s market share, and (2) simply announcing what the market share of coal, natural gas, wind, and solar must be, and then requiring plants to reduce operations or subsidize their competitors to get there.” The court viewed the first category as an uncontroversial consequence of standard environmental regulation—indeed, it is a ubiquitous consequence of practically all regulation. Only the second category is impermissible for power-sector standards.

In its regulation of the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, which started in the Obama administration, EPA has never required a specific market shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles. These regulations are therefore conceptually different from the one struck down in West Virginia v. EPA. Also, in EPA’s earlier vehicle regulations for greenhouse gases, the market shift that resulted from the regulation was minor and clearly “incidental,” since manufacturers primarily met the regulatory standard by making their internal combustion vehicles more efficient. And, even if a court were to find that the Biden administration’s later standards were impermissibly premised on large market shift toward EVs, the proper remedy would be to strike down those standards, not to eliminate EPA’s ability to put in place any greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles, including ones that did not have this feature.

Lee Zeldin, the EPA Administrator, repeatedly says that his primary concern is with following the law. His characterization of the key Supreme Court cases on EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases tells a very different story.

The term Orwellian is often trotted out as a cliché, but it suits the confluence of President Donald Trump’s two big actions today—holding the first meeting of his “Board of Peace” and finishing the mobilization of a massive military force on the flanks of Iran, ready to attack the Islamic Republic as soon as this weekend.

His Board of Peace, to which Trump said the U.S. would commit $10 billion (for what, it’s unclear), seems largely theatrical. The war in Gaza, which Trump claims to have ended, persists—Israel continues its demolitions, while Hamas is tightening its grip on the place and refusing to disarm—and the board’s larger goal of supplanting or overseeing the United Nations worldwide is fanciful, to say the least.

Meanwhile, the point of the armed buildup around Iran—the largest assembly of U.S. warplanes and warships in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq—is remarkably unclear. The U.S. armada mobilized to the region includes 18 warships (two of which are aircraft carriers) and many fighter jets, bombers, antimissile systems, and electronic jammers on nearby bases. This is enough to fight a weekslong battle, hitting targets related to any and all of those missions and disabling or intercepting most of the missiles that Iran might launch in response. But for what purpose—and with what chance of success, whatever the purpose might be—is another question.

Does Trump want to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, dismantle its ballistic missile sites, pull down the regime, or simply threaten a combination of all three to pressure the Iranians to make a “deal”—but a deal to do what?

In January, Trump threatened “strong” military action against Iran if its leaders killed any of the growing mass of anti-government protesters. Tehran canceled the execution of one protester, leading Trump to pronounce his demand satisfied. However, troops and police proceeded to mow down thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of protesters in the streets, to no objection from Washington. As was the case in Venezuela, democracy and human rights were pieces of Trump’s original war rhetoric—but not in his war policy.

Many were shocked when his real policy in Venezuela turned out to be abducting its criminal president, Nicolás Maduro, and compelling his successors—who had been deputies in Maduro’s Cabinet—to cede control of their country’s oil to the United States. Maria Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela’s democratic opposition, who expected to take power if Maduro were overthrown, was pushed under the bus. (Her attempt to gain Trump’s favor—giving him the Nobel Peace Prize trophy that she won but that he thought he’d deserved—was a futile gesture.)

So what, exactly, is Trump up to in Iran?

Is he now going after its oil? Probably not, though keeping the oil from being traded to Iran’s biggest customer, China, might be part of the equation. Still, the assembled armada seems overkill for that goal.

Trump says his main concern is to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon. The irony is that Trump claimed to “obliterate” the nation’s nuclear program in last June’s attack—known as Operation Midnight Hammer—on Iran’s mountain-buried enriched-uranium site. As many noted at the time, Trump exaggerated the extent of the damage; for one thing, Iranians might have removed much of the uranium in anticipation of the assault. However, the damage did significantly set back Iran’s program, perhaps by a few years. What is the rush now?

Iran’s ballistic missiles endanger Israel and U.S. bases in the region. In the brief Iran-Israel war last summer, 90 percent of Iran’s missiles were shot down or crashed before reaching their targets. But Iran launched 550 missiles, as well as 1,000 drones, and the 50 or so that pierced through the defenses inflicted considerable damage. It is not known how many missiles Iran has now—probably a few thousand. Manufacturing sites are concentrated and can be taken out fairly easily, but the missiles themselves are small and mobile. Many would survive an initial onslaught, and if Tehran’s leaders think their regime is about to be crushed, they might decide to launch a massive retaliation, bringing down their enemies along with themselves. In fact, in recent weeks, some Middle East leaders, notably the Saudis and other Sunnis (who have been fighting proxy wars against Iran on various fronts) urged Trump not to attack Iran, fearing that Iran would return fire against their lands too. They have barred U.S. planes from flying over their territory if Trump does decide to attack.

Here, then, is another irony. As a result of last summer’s missile exchanges, June’s Midnight Hammer, and a string of devastating attacks on Iran’s main proxy militias, Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel is now stronger and Iran is weaker than they have been in decades. Trump’s mobilization in the region underlines this disparity. Does Iran really pose a threat that justifies such a massive U.S. reaction?

Then again, from Israel’s perspective, Iran’s relative weakness is the point. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long pushed for regime change in Tehran. Though he never said so explicitly, his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama and six other leaders signed in 2014, wasn’t so much fear of an Iranian bomb (the accord really did all but stop its development) as fear that the removal of Iran’s sanctions and its integration into the world economy—the rewards for dismantling its nuclear apparatus—would solidify the Islamic Republic’s position, strengthen its international standing, and thereby increase Israel’s vulnerability, if not to nuclear bombs, then to other forms of intimidation. During Trump’s first term, Netanyahu persuaded him to rip up the nuclear deal; with the president now in his second term, the prime minister is hoping to lasso him into finishing off the regime.

The Iranian government is a horror. It represses its own people, now more than ever; it assists terrorists; and it’s an economic disaster as well. But it’s worth asking: If the mullahs are toppled or lose their grip on power in one way or another, who replaces them? It’s extremely unlikely that the successors would be the Western-leaning urban youth who have been demonstrating in the streets. They lack leaders and organizers, mainly because the regime has imprisoned or killed rising potential leaders—and disabled or co-opted tools and technologies that could enable organization.

If the mullahs fell, power would likely be picked up by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is the Iranian army’s elite unit, with more than 150,000 personnel, who protect the regime, control much of the economy, and are no less hostile than the supreme leader and his mullahs toward Israel, Sunnis, and the West.

It’s possible that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have made contact with certain IRGC officers, discussing terms of mutual support in the event of regime change. We now know that the CIA infiltrated the Venezuelan leadership, which helped the U.S. Special Forces track down Maduro. However, we don’t yet know whether or how long Venezuela’s old-new leaders will keep to their side of whatever long-term bargain they might have struck. It’s doubly uncertain whether any emerging IRGC strongmen—with whom the U.S. has had no aboveground relationship at all—would honor any deal. It’s a very poor bet to act on the assumption that they would.

Which leads to the final possibility: that Trump is amassing all this firepower to pressure the Iranians to make a deal. He has said that, to avoid dreadful consequences, Iran must agree to enrich no uranium, dismantle its ballistic missiles, and sever relations with Shiite militias in the region.

The problem is that these terms are untenable to Iran, and would be even if the country had more-pliant leaders.

In the early stages of negotiation toward the 2014 nuclear deal, Obama also pushed for a ban on enrichment but soon realized that this was a dead end. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which is observed by 191 nation-states, including Iran) not only allows its signatories to enrich uranium to 3 percent purity, but it enshrines that level of enrichment as a right. This level is very low. “Highly enriched” uranium is defined as 20 percent, “weapons-grade” as 90 percent. The treaty further allows international inspectors to verify whether countries are abiding with this limit. Obama’s Iran nuclear deal had tight inspection procedures; Iran was declared in compliance.

For Iran to accept a ban on enrichment, when the rest of the world is entitled to some, would be tantamount to surrender before a shot has been fired. No leader, Islamist or otherwise, would accept this.

A ban on ballistic missiles is also unlikely, as they are Iran’s main source of deterrence. Iran’s support for radical militias—such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—does clarify the regime’s nature: A government can legitimately observe a right to bear conventional arms and enrich uranium (a little bit, anyway) but not to arm havoc-wreaking militias. Still, the Iranians have relied so heavily on these militias for power in the region that they would need tangible benefits to cut the cord.

What is the Trump administration offering Iran in return for taking such extraordinary measures? The question is misleading. There is no “Trump administration” when it comes to such matters. There is only Trump and his two emissaries, fellow real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. They have supplanted, and for the most part ignored, the experienced experts in the State Department and the National Security Council who usually hammer out positions and handle negotiations.

Witkoff has no diplomatic experience whatever. Kushner did play a role in the Abraham Accords, which formalized diplomatic and economic relations between Israel and some Arab states (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco), but those nations already had informal relations, and they were not at all in a state of war.

Like Trump, they seem to believe that diplomacy requires no special knowledge and that dealmaking is dealmaking, whether you’re dealing with the Kremlin, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or the New York City Buildings Department. This blithe arrogance is naivete disguised as hardheadedness, and it goes a long way toward explaining the pair’s utter failure at settling the war in Ukraine. (There, they don’t grasp Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motive for war. If they did, they would realize that he doesn’t want peace without the complete subjugation of Kyiv.)

What happens these next few days in and around Iran? Who knows. It’s possible Trump himself doesn’t know. The Iranians will try to stretch out the negotiations, which they probably see as inherently fruitless. Trump may wait them out for a while, but perhaps not for long. If he starts a war, he may try to keep it limited at first, but the Iranians may escalate, anticipating their worst-case scenario, which Trump may then make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wars, once started, sometimes spiral out of control. This is why it’s smart for leaders to know what they want, and know how far they want to press things, before they make their first move. It’s also why, in negotiating a peaceful way out of a crisis, it’s good for them to know what the other side wants too—not necessarily to appease them but to scope out the boundaries of what’s possible without war and, given that, whether it’s better to modify peace terms or go to war.

At this point, it looks like Trump, pushed by Netanyahu, is rushing into conflict recklessly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

On Jan. 26, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz prohibited ICE from moving an immigrant, Baljinder Kumar, out of New Jersey while he challenged his unlawful detention. Five days later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement flagrantly defied that order, transferring Kumar to a detention center in … Texas. After his lawyers complained, federal officials returned Kumar to New Jersey. But Farbiarz was not inclined to let this disobedience go unpunished. He informed the New Jersey U.S. attorney’s office that he sought to craft a “remedy” for ICE’s defiance—and would require an “investigation” to assist him. He then ordered the office to investigate itself and to “enumerate each instance” in which it had “violated an order issued by a judge of this district” since Dec. 5.

Last Friday, Jordan Fox—an associate deputy attorney general and special attorney assigned to New Jersey—gave Farbiarz an answer: The office had violated at least 56 court orders since December alone, all related to the Trump administration’s unlawful policy mandating the indefinite detention of noncitizens legally entitled to a bond hearing. This confession, first reported by Politico’s Kyle Cheney, was accompanied by a letter stating that “we regret deeply all violations” but insisting that they were “unintentional and immediately rectified once we learned of them.” Fox, who is helping lead the New Jersey office after courts ousted Donald Trump’s first choice, Alina Habba, depicted these transgressions as relatively minor and rare. But Farbiarz did not buy it, noting that Kumar’s illegal transfer to Texas was far from an “outlier.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed this court-ordered investigation, its startling conclusions, and the possible consequences. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: I guess I have to give credit where it’s due. Jordan Fox took one for the team and laid out, chapter and verse, all the court orders this office had violated.

Mark Joseph Stern: Sort of. Fox actually excluded two categories of violations, missed status update deadlines and late docket notifications. When you include those, it’s 75 violations. So let’s dig into these numbers. At least 17 times, the government transferred a noncitizen to a different detention facility after a court unambiguously prohibited it from doing so. That means they were detained in another state, where it would be harder to reach their lawyers, and perhaps where judges are more inclined to rule for the government. At least 10 times, the U.S. attorney’s office failed to produce evidence ordered by the court. And at least one time, the government deported a noncitizen in direct contravention of a court order forbidding that deportation.

In some ways, this is a bigger deal than the ICE lawyer’s meltdown in court a few weeks ago. We now have the U.S. attorney’s office not going rogue here, but admitting under oath that it has breached court orders more than 50 times. And there were often dire consequences for the people whose rights were violated. Fox tried to paint this as a few errors around the edges, but to me it depicts a complete breakdown of the system. And it shows that if you sign up for this work—if you agree to work in a U.S. attorney’s office—you now know you will be violating court orders, maybe on the daily. Everybody is on notice: If you are assigned to handle these cases, you will violate court orders, and you may be held in contempt.

I’m old enough to remember Judge James Boasberg trying to ascertain whether his court order around the rendition flights to CECOT prison was flouted, and the lies and deceit that went into gaslighting him about that. And he’s still trying to get to the bottom of it! We talked about that story obsessively last spring. A year later, defiance of court orders doesn’t capture two weeks of a news cycle. We just say: Yeah, they do that now. They don’t care what judges think anymore. The American public has somehow normalized this.

All I can say is bless Boasberg for continuing to push that contempt case. I am glad to hear the rising chorus of other judges doing the same. We’ve seen Republicans in Congress say they want to impeach judges who hold Trump administration officials in contempt. Maybe this could be a Spartacus moment where you can’t impeach them all?

That takes us back to Minnesota, where Judge Laura Provinzino found Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Isihara in civil contempt during a Wednesday hearing for violating a court order. She said she’d fine him $500 a day until the government complied. One interesting piece of this story is that Isihara is a JAG attorney who was conscripted to help with the flood of habeas petitions in response to the mass detention policy as prosecutors continue to flee the Justice Department. And even he said he couldn’t handle the caseload.

This story illustrates the mix of incompetence and malice that is defining the administration’s mass detention campaign. The government arrested this individual, Rigoberto Soto Jimenez, at his workplace in January—even though he had lived here since 2018 and has no criminal record or a final order of removal authorizing his deportation. ICE then hustled him to Texas. His lawyers still managed to persuade Provinzino to issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering his immediate release in Minnesota and the return of all confiscated property.

The government did neither. It released him in Texas, not Minnesota, and withheld all of his property, including his driver’s license and other identification paperwork. So he was just dumped and abandoned. His lawyers had to go to Provinzino and tell her that her order had been flagrantly violated, which is when she scheduled the hearing. Soto Jimenez managed to make his way back from Texas, but as of Wednesday, ICE still hadn’t returned his identification cards. So Provinzino held Isihara, the JAG lawyer detailed to this case, in civil contempt until the cards were returned, with the $500 daily sanction. Fox 9 News reports that her order finally prompted the agency to mail back the ID cards. Which gives us the answer to the question we’ve been asking: What will it take to make ICE comply with the law? The answer is dragging JAGs into your courtroom and holding them in contempt.

The caseload is impossible. Nobody can do this volume of work. If you are a government lawyer thinking, Step aside, Mr. Isihara, because I can do this better next time, just know you’re being set up to pay $500 a day for the privilege.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Someone compromised open source AI coding assistant Cline CLI&#39;s npm package earlier this week in an odd supply chain attack that secretly installed OpenClaw on developers&#39; machines without their knowledge.

The incident occurred on Tuesday, when an &quot;unauthorized party&quot; used a compromised token to publish an update to Cline CLI on its npm registry that installs OpenClaw - the AI agent platform slash security nightmare - on users&#39; computers when they install cline@2.3.0.

&quot;Users who installed Cline CLI cline@2.3.0 during the approximately 8-hour window between 3:26 AM PT and 11:30 AM PT on February 17 will have openclaw globally installed,&quot; Cline&#39;s maintainers said in a security advisory. &quot;The openclaw package is a legitimate open source project and is not malicious, but its installation was not authorized or intended.&quot;

The maintainers also revoked the compromised token, and added that &quot;npm publishing now uses OIDC provenance via GitHub Actions.&quot;

Anyone who installed Cline during this time period should update to a fixed version (2.4.0 or higher) and check their environment for a surprise OpenClaw installation.

Earlier this month, security researcher Adnan Khan found and disclosed a prompt injection vulnerability (since fixed) to Cline that could be abused for this exact purpose.

&quot;To make sure it&#39;s clear in the midst of the NPM package situation: I did NOT conduct overt testing on Cline&#39;s repository,&quot; Khan said in an update to his research.

&quot;I conducted my PoC on a mirror of Cline to confirm the prompt injection vulnerability,&quot; he added. &quot;A different actor found my PoC on my test repository and used it to directly attack Cline and obtain the publication credentials.&quot;

Microsoft did note a &quot;small but noticeable uptick in installations of OpenClaw initiated by Cline CLI installation script&quot; during the eight-hour supply chain incident on February 17.

StepSecurity, meanwhile, reported that the compromised version was downloaded about 4,000 times before the package maintainers deprecated it.

We don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible for slipping OpenClaw into Cline&#39;s npm registry - and for what purposes other than creating more chaotic AI agents.  ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/spacex_falcon_europe_breakup_lithium_plume/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that burned up over Europe last year left a massive lithium plume in its wake, say a group of scientists. They warn the disaster is likely a sign of things to come as Earth&#39;s atmosphere continues to become a heavily trafficked superhighway to space.

In a paper published Thursday, an international group of scientists reports what they say is the first measurement of upper-atmosphere pollution resulting from the re-entry of space debris, as well as the first time ground-based light detection and ranging (lidar) has been shown to be able to detect space debris ablation.

The measurements stem from a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage that sprung an oxygen leak about a year ago, sending it into an uncontrolled re-entry. Then it broke up and rained debris down on Poland. The rocket not only littered farm fields, but also injected lithium into the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT), where ground-based sensors detected a tenfold increase at an altitude of 96 km about 20 hours after the rocket re-entered the atmosphere, according to the paper.

Lithium was selected for the study because of its considerable presence in spacecraft, both in lithium-ion batteries and lithium-aluminum alloy used in the construction of spacecraft. A single Falcon 9 upper stage, like the one that broke up over Poland and released the lithium plume, is estimated to contain 30 kg of lithium just in the alloy used in tank walls.

By contrast, around 80 grams of lithium enter the atmosphere per day from cosmic dust particles, the researchers noted.

&quot;This finding supports growing concerns that space traffic may pollute the upper atmosphere in ways not yet fully understood,&quot; the paper notes, adding that the continued re-entry of spacecraft and satellites is of particular concern given how the composition of spacecraft is different from natural meteoroids.

&quot;Satellites and rocket stages introduce engineered materials such as aluminium alloys, composite structures, and rare earth elements from onboard electronics, substances rarely found in natural extraterrestrial matter,&quot; the paper explained. &quot;The consequences of increasing pollution from re-entering space debris on radiative transfer, ozone chemistry, and aerosol microphysics remain largely unknown.&quot;

The effect on Earth&#39;s atmosphere posed by spacecraft and satellite re-entry is one that&#39;s been a growing concern for astrophysicists like Harvard sky-watcher Jonathan McDowell, who has echoed similar concerns to The Register as the European scientists raised in their paper.

&quot;Using the upper atmosphere as an incinerator&quot; is a massive blind spot, McDowell told us in a discussion last year. He said today that he hadn&#39;t yet had a chance to review the Falcon 9 lithium plume paper, but told us it&#39;s important research to further our understanding of a largely unknown risk to the planet and all life on it.

As we noted previously, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported that roughly 10 percent of sampled sulfuric acid particles in the stratosphere contain aluminum and other exotic metals consistent with the burn-up of rockets and satellites. The body believes that number could grow to as much as 50 percent in the coming years as launch cadences, and re-entries, increase.

&quot;Beyond this single event, recurring re-entries may sustain an increased level of anthropogenic flux of metals and metal oxides into the middle atmosphere with cumulative, climate-relevant consequences,&quot; the researchers explained in the Falcon 9 paper.

This latest bit of research from Europe shows that we can at least trace atmospheric space launch aerosols to their source, the research team says, no matter how many unknowns remain to be discovered.

They also warn that &quot;coordinated, multi-site observations&quot; and &quot;whole-atmosphere chemistry-climate modelling&quot; will be needed to better understand how re-entry emissions influence atmospheric chemistry and particle formation.

We reached out to the authors for more information, including the potential health effects if any, and will update this if we hear back. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/india_ai_supercomputer_cerebras_uae/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia rival Cerebras Systems&#39; dinner plate-sized accelerators will power a new supercomputing cluster in India capable of 8 exaFLOPS of AI compute.

The installation, announced in New Delhi during the AI Impact Summit this week, is part of a collaboration between the United Arab Emirates&#39; Mohamed Bin Zayed University of AI (MBZUAI) and India&#39;s Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC).

The system itself will be deployed by the UAE&#39;s AI crown jewel, technology company G42, in a bid to bolster the nation&#39;s sovereign compute capacity. If G42 sounds familiar, that&#39;s because the UAE-based cloud provider and AI model dev is one of Cerebras&#39; largest backers, having previously financed the chip startup&#39;s Condor Galaxy deployment effort at an estimated cost of $900 million.

G42 has sought to carve out a niche by helping other nations build sovereign AI models trained in their native languages. Late last year, the cloud provider released NANDA 87B, an 87 billion parameter open weights model trained in Hindi and English.

&quot;Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness,&quot; CEO of G42 India Manu Jain said in a canned statement. &quot;This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security.&quot;

While the system will be deployed by G42, the company says it&#39;ll be operated under India-defined governance frameworks and that all data will remain within the nation&#39;s borders. Once operational, the supercomputer will be made available to Indian universities, startups, and small and mid-sized businesses.

Cerebras tells El Reg the super will be powered by its WSE-3 wafer-scale accelerators. A little back-of-the-napkin math tells us that the machine will likely feature 64 of Cerebras&#39; WSE-3 wafer-scale accelerators, each of which is capable of churning out 125 petaFLOPS of highly sparse 16-bit floating point performance.

These massive chips are somewhat unique in that they don&#39;t rely on pricey high-bandwidth memory (HBM) commonly found in Nvidia and AMD GPUs, and instead use lightning-fast on-chip SRAM. Each of Cerebras&#39; 23 kW CS-3 systems features 44 GB of SRAM good for 21 petabytes a second of memory bandwidth. That&#39;s roughly 1,000x faster than the HBM4 on Nvidia&#39;s newly announced Rubin GPUs.

Originally designed for AI training, the chip&#39;s speedy SRAM has made it particularly potent for memory-bound AI inference workloads. Artificial Analysis reports Cerebras can serve gpt-oss 120b High at nearly 2,853 tokens a second per user, more than 3x faster than the next fastest GPU-based inference provider. This no doubt played into OpenAI&#39;s decision to begin deploying select models on Cerebras&#39; hardware last month.

Today’s announcement comes just days after AMD and Nvidia unveiled several large-scale deployments in India powered by their respective compute platforms. As part of the partnership with Tata Consultancy Services, AMD will deploy 200 MW of its next-gen Helios racks powered by its MI455X.

Indian cloud service provider Yotta said it planned to field a cluster of 20,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Bit barn builders Larsen and Toubro also laid out plans for a giga-scale AI datacenter network, beginning with a 30 MW facility in Chennai and a 40 megawatt site in Mumbai. Among its first tenants will be E2E Networks’ deployment of B200 accelerators. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Las Vegas hotel and casino giant Wynn Resorts appears to be the latest victim of data-grabbing and extortion gang ShinyHunters.

On Friday, the cybercrime crew listed the hospitality company on its blog, claiming to have stolen more than 800,000 records containing employees&#39; Social Security numbers and other private details. The extortionists set a February 23 deadline for Wynn to &quot;reach out&quot; and threatened to leak the data, &quot;along with several annoying (digital) problems that&#39;ll come your way,&quot; if the resort chain did not comply with the demands.

Samples of the stolen data seen by The Register contain employees&#39; full names, emails, phone numbers, positions, salaries, start dates, birthdays, and other personal information.

Wynn Resorts, which owns five resorts, 81 restaurants, and 200 high-end retail outlets, did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries. We will update this story when we hear back from the company.

ShinyHunters set a fee of 22.34 Bitcoin (about $1.5 million) as the &quot;starting price&quot; for the stolen files, according to a spokesperson for the crime group, who told The Register that the digital intruders gained initial access to Wynn&#39;s systems in September 2025 via an Oracle PeopleSoft vulnerability using an employee&#39;s credentials.

Shiny declined to say if it got the Wynn employee to give up the credentials via a social engineering trick, or simply paid the individual for access. The group has previously used Telegram to solicit insider access, and in one case reportedly claimed it agreed to pay a CrowdStrike employee $25,000 for access, though the security shop said no systems were breached.

The claimed Wynn Resorts breach follows a slew of recent ShinyHunters intrusions, several of which involved voice phishing to obtain single-sign-on codes from users of Okta, Microsoft, and Google services.

It&#39;s also notable that nearly three years ago, a group with ties to ShinyHunters&#39; crime collaborative hacked two other major Vegas hotel and casino chains: Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts.

In late 2023, Scattered Spider abused Okta SSO codes and help-desk calls to break into both resort chains&#39; networks, deployed ransomware on their networks, and stole data belonging to tens of thousands of customers.

In September 2025, Las Vegas cops cuffed a teen linked to the casino hacks shortly after British police arrested two other teens accused of being members of the notorious cybercrime gang.

At least seven other suspected Scattered Spider members were arrested in 2024 as part of wider probes following the Las Vegas resort intrusions.  ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/amazon_denies_kiro_agentic_ai_behind_outage/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a cautionary tale of agentic AI, AWS reportedly suffered service outages caused by its own AI coding tools in December - though the company insists the downtime was ultimately due to human error.

Amazon&#39;s cloud platform suffered a 13-hour disruption affecting one service after resident engineers allowed Kiro to make changes, according to four sources who spoke to the Financial Times.

Kiro, unveiled last year, is described by AWS as an agentic coding service than can turn prompts into detailed specs and then into working code, with the aim of making it easier to bring vibe-coded apps into a production environment.

The service was designed to avoid the pitfalls that have already plagued other AI-enhanced development tools, such as wiping an entire hard drive partition or deleting a database.

However, Kiro reportedly opted to &quot;delete and recreate the environment&quot; that led to the outage in late 2025.

This was not the first time the firm’s AI tools had been involved in a service interruption after being allowed to resolve issues without human intervention, per the FT report.

However, Amazon&#39;s version of events differs, according to a spokesperson. In a statement sent to The Register, the company said:

&quot;This brief event was the result of user (AWS employee) error - specifically misconfigured access controls - not AI. The service interruption was an extremely limited event last year when a single service (AWS Cost Explorer - which helps customers visualize, understand, and manage AWS costs and usage over time) in one of our two Regions in Mainland China was affected.

&quot;This event didn&#39;t impact compute, storage, database, AI technologies, or any other of the hundreds of services that we run. Following these events, we implemented numerous additional safeguards, including mandatory peer review for production access.&quot;

AWS said users need to configure which actions Kiro can take, and by default, Kiro requests authorization before taking any action, but in this case an engineer was using a role with broader permissions than expected.

While Amazon denies Kiro was to blame, it still serves as a warning for anyone thinking of allowing AI agents to take actions without human oversight. There is a growing body of stories, including one where an agent got stuck in a loop repeatedly calling a database API.

Kiro has had some other issues since its launch. AWS had to introduce daily usage limits and a user waitlist for the tool last year, citing unexpectedly high demand, and a &quot;pricing bug&quot; that led some users to describe it as &quot;a wallet-wrecking tragedy.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/saaq_sap_overrun/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A judge-led commission in Quebec has found that the state agency responsible for driver&#39;s licenses and license plates misled the Canadian government about a troubled SAP ERP project that ran more than C$245 million ($179 million/£132.6 million) over budget.

The report into the disastrous nine-year project – which went live three years later than first predicted – also reveals that Société de l&#39;Assurance Automobile du Québec (SAAQ) did not know whether ERP was the appropriate technology for its digital transformation program and the launch of an online processing service called SAAQclic.

During the early planning process in late 2014, the project&#39;s management relied heavily on SAP to understand if it needed an ERP suite to achieve its goals in digital transformation, the report said. SAP at the time was preparing to bet its future on S/4HANA – its flagship ERP product – which SAAQ ended up adopting.

The report, tabled by Judge Denis Gallant, said the level of ties between project planners and SAP during the pre-tendering stage was surprising. It found evidence that SAP had a privileged place with SAAQ&#39;s staff and provided information on the operation of its systems before the launch of competition, in which Microsoft, Infor, and Oracle would participate.

A spokesperson for SAP said: &quot;SAP has cooperated fully with Quebec&#39;s Gallant Commission in its investigation of the 2017 procurement and implementation project run by the Société de l&#39;Assurance Automobile du Québec (SAAQ).

&quot;SAP is committed to the highest standards of ethics and compliance in all the markets in which it operates, and maintains a robust compliance management system to ensure that the company is compliant with all laws and regulations, providing assurance of integrity in all engagements with customers, partners and all stakeholders across the world.&quot;

The report says the internal project team carried out a matching process for ERP against SAAQ&#39;s needs across a range of project areas, and then combined the scores to reach a conclusion. The commission criticized the process for failing to consider how widely matching scores varied. For some areas, such as insurance, ERP scored highly – SAP has a tailored product in this industry. In other areas critical to SAAQ&#39;s main business – the public-facing issuing of driver&#39;s licenses and license plates – ERP did not score as well.

The project&#39;s directors approved the decision to buy an ERP product for the main technical solution for its digital transformation in February 2015. They said they made the decision after considering in-house custom development, a best-of-breed plus integration approach, and an ERP suite.

However, the commission said it could not find evidence of the project team&#39;s separate in-depth analysis of the three approaches. Following a competitive tender, SAP was selected as the main software supplier and LGS, a local IBM-owned company, together with Big Blue, was appointed the systems integrator.

The first phase of the project went reasonably smoothly, but during the second phase, the project ran into trouble, the report states. It dealt with processes at the heart of SAAQ&#39;s mission, including issuing driver&#39;s licences and vehicle registration certificates, and was expected to take two and a half years, from October 2017 to April 2020. It planned to go live with a front-end SAAQclic online system in January 2020.

The second phase was different from earlier work in that it required a high degree of customization to the ERP suite. The commission said this was the beginning of the project&#39;s financial troubles. The requirement for a highly customized solution was compounded by a number of other factors. In September 2019 – more than two years into the overall program – the project leaders decided to change the scope and include processes to support roadside enforcement and checking driver licenses. This work was awarded to the IBM/SAP alliance without outside competition.

The tech teams also found business rules they hoped to define in the ERP suite were more complex than expected, and poorly documented. From the outset, the team decided to adopt an agile methodology, in which the implementation begins before the design is finished. But because of the lack of documentation and unforeseen complexity, the approach led to a massive increase in the number of iterative sprints needed to get to a solution.

Lastly, the project was plagued by a shortage of skills and a high vacancy rate. The commission criticized SAAQ for its lack of preparation and SAP/IBM for underestimating the complexity of the work.

An IBM spokesperson said: &quot;We acknowledge the work undertaken by the Gallant Commission and are reviewing their findings carefully. Our engagement followed a thorough and rigorous procurement process, and we acted in good faith in accordance with the law, our contract, and applicable professional standards.&quot;

The program&#39;s budget for the build phase was C$375 million ($274 million/ £202 mllion) in July 2017. By September 2020, that had nearly doubled to C$682 million. Including support until 2027, the total cost was set to be C$968 million. The go-live of phase two was also pushed back to the spring of 2023. It did not go smoothly.

In November 2022, several witnesses working on the project said they had found the solution was not ready for deployment, the commission said. But instead of delaying the launch, the project&#39;s leadership sanctioned an additional payment to the SAP/IBM alliance, one it was only supposed to receive once the work was complete.

At the end of January, most of SAAQ&#39;s services and transactions were closed to the public until the system went live on February 16, 2023. It had prepared the publicity to introduce the new online system, SAAQclic.

On February 20, 2023, the SAAQclic portal opened for all customers. It was either unavailable or slow, the report states. Unable to process some transactions, independent merchants directed customers to the SAAQ offices. As the public tried to use the portal, they struggled to get it to work, and they also turned up in person. SAAQ&#39;s offices were left grappling with a new system and a deluge of people demanding services. A TV report showed large queues forming, and with other reports including angry customers venting their frustration by raising voices against staff, some of whom called the police. The police themselves were unable to access the system to perform roadside checks of vehicles and drivers&#39; licenses, resulting in unjustified arrests and detentions.

In March, the government intervened, with Minister of Transport Geneviève Guilbault signing three orders, including one temporarily suspending police tickets and fines for driving without a valid licence. In April 2023, auditors from PwC were brought in. They later concluded phase 2 did not meet its specifications. Two further payments of around $100 million were sanctioned to the alliance. The implementation program was ended in September 2023 as phase 2 was completed. In 2025, SAAQ formally decided to put an end to subsequent phases 2.5 and 3, even though they were included in the original budget.

In its early, pre-tender estimates, SAP said SAAQ&#39;s ERP system might cost a total of between C$141 million and C$163 million, including both internal and supplier costs. The project ended up costing around C$620 million, and delivered less than the original scope. Including ongoing support, it was C$1.1 billion.

The commission is highly critical of the project&#39;s leadership. Its report says they misled government officials about escalating costs and delays. Judge Gallant called for honesty in public projects, not least because even when they are failing, there is an opportunity to learn.

SAAQ may reflect on its decision to put an ERP system at the heart of its digital transformation. For now, it has a highly customized implementation of SAP S/4HANA, which future tech teams may need to maintain and one day upgrade or move away from. ®

If the PlayStation 5 is your console of choice — and you’re not satisfied with the DualSense gamepad it comes with — the DualSense Edge may be what you’re looking for. Luckily, if its high asking price of $199 was keeping you away, Sony is now offering the white and black controller via the PlayStation Direct storefront in refurbished condition for $169 ($30 off). It comes with the same one-year warranty as a new unit, though it may exhibit minor cosmetic imperfections.

Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components.

The DualSense Edge is significantly more customizable than Sony’s pack-in controller, with toggleable control schemes you can switch without leaving your game, mappable rear paddles, and swappable joysticks in case one breaks. On its back, there are switches that let you adjust the stopping point of its triggers, allowing either a full pull or a short and clicky feel. It’s also easy to tweak the joysticks’ deadzone and sensitivity levels.

In addition to being a great pairing with the PS5, the DualSense Edge is also compatible with Windows. Several PC games published by PlayStation Studios feature support for some of the controller’s unique features, too. The wireless controller’s only significant downside is that it’s limited to eight hours of battery life, which is a couple of hours shorter than Sony’s standard DualSense gamepad. It shouldn’t be an issue if you remember to charge the controller every few days, though.

            <div id="article-text">Detroit badly bungled the EV transition. Then Trump wiped out emission rules.

Detroit badly bungled the EV transition. Then Trump wiped out emission rules.

For decades, America’s auto industry was the envy of the world, driven by mass production, the rise of Detroit’s Big Three automakers, and the iconic stylings of the 1950s and ’60s.

Then, through a series of blunders and missteps, things started to unravel. There was the fuel crisis of the 1970s, which led to an influx of Japanese imports that bested Detroit in fuel savings and reliability. And then there were various global financial collapses throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and a significant decline in automotive quality as the Big Three continued to push bigger and more expensive vehicles, at the expense of road safety and global competitiveness.

And then there was, for lack of a better term, the great EV whiff of the 2010s and 2020s. After sleeping on electric vehicles for too long, the Big Three finally got in the game — but they botched it, rolling out a series of electric versions of gas cars that lacked the finesse or gee-whiz software tricks of Tesla. They were also too expensive for most Americans.

And now the real financial fallout begins. Ford announced a $19.5 billion write-down on its EV investments — one of the largest in corporate history. On the same day, the Blue Oval said it was killing the F-150 Lightning, a vehicle once heralded as the return of the Model T. General Motors came next, with a $7.6 billion charge. And then Stellantis, with a colossal $26.6 billion hit on its EV investments.

Cumulatively, that’s over $50 billion gone. Poof.

How did the US get EVs so wrong? The lazy answer is that Americans just don’t want them, preferring to keep pumping dead dinosaur sludge into their lifted Ford F-150s and not have to deal with all that charging. But the real reason is that Detroit never took the challenge seriously, while dealers actively worked against the transition, worried about losses in service and repair. And then President Donald Trump turned EVs politically toxic, and here we are. Americans are now falling behind in what may be one of the most significant technological shifts since the first car rolled off the assembly line.

Cumulatively, that’s over $50 billion gone. Poof

As such, Trump seems happy to accelerate the auto industry’s rush toward irrelevance. Along with Congressional Republicans, Trump eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit, right when the market was finding its footing. GM’s EV sales dropped 43 percent in the quarter right after the tax credit ended.

The Trump administration has also rolled back emissions regulations that were designed to push automakers to build more EVs and challenged California’s authority to set its own pollution limits. And then, earlier this month, the real kill shot: Trump’s EPA rescinded the landmark “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health — the foundation of the agency’s vehicle-pollution rules first adopted in 2010.

Automakers will no longer face fines for exceeding fuel emissions standards, nor will they have to buy pricey climate credits from Tesla and other EV makers. They have free rein to pollute.

“The US no longer has emissions standards of any meaning,” Margo Oge, who served as the EPA’s top vehicle emissions regulator under three presidents and has since advised both automakers and environmental groups, told The New York Times. “Nothing. Zero. Not many countries have zero.”

There are other ways of looking at this. Without emissions standards or the endangerment finding looming over them, automakers will have some “breathing room” to continue to churn out big, gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs that help pay the bills, while also hopefully continuing to fund R&D efforts to design better, more efficient, and most importantly profitable electric vehicles, said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.

“Hopefully, they’ve learned their lesson and don’t allow this breathing room to be their gas chamber,” he added.

“Hopefully, they’ve learned their lesson and don’t allow this breathing room to be their gas chamber.”

As the US backslides, the rest of the world is already transitioning to electric power. In 2025, people bought a record 20.7 million EVs worldwide, up from just three million in 2020. In a number of nations, EVs represent a significant portion of overall auto sales: 20 percent in South Korea; 50 percent in China; 68 percent in Denmark; 65 percent in Sweden; and 96 percent in Norway. In the US, EV sales were roughly 10 percent.

How’d they do it? Sustained investment in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and affordable models. That’s it, really. China is estimated to have spent between $150 billion and $250 billion on EV development, raw materials, and everything else, and now the country’s auto industry is on the cusp of taking over the world. Well, the world minus the US, where tariffs and restrictions on Chinese software have kept BYD, Xiaomi, and others from coming in and decimating the Big Three.

Just as the pendulum has swung against EVs, it could certainly swing back. California is challenging the move by Congressional Republicans to revoke its waiver to enact its own emissions regulations. If it wins, automakers could find themselves stuck between the pro-EV California and the anti-EV Washington.

This will likely force automakers to continue to develop multiple powertrains — ICE, hybrid, EV — for longer than they would have preferred, said Ed Kim, president and chief analyst at AutoPacific. If Ford, GM, and Stellantis want to continue to compete globally — hell, if they want to continue to survive, and not get completely taken out by China — they will need to ignore the regulatory impulse to abandon EVs altogether and keep trying to crack the code.

Ford says it’s committed. Mary Barra at GM too. Stellantis is in a tougher spot, but has yet to completely throw in the towel. European, Japanese, and Korean automakers will have a role to play too. The EV transition isn’t defeated. It’s winning all across the globe, just not in America. Not yet.

FCC Chair Brendan Carr says broadcasters could broadcast daily segments highlighting historical events, or start each day with the Pledge of the Allegiance.

Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr is urging broadcasters to air “patriotic, pro-America content” in celebration of the US’s 250th anniversary. The initiative, called the “Pledge America Campaign,” encourages broadcasters to run public service announcements, short segments, or specials to promote “civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history.”

Carr says broadcasters can “voluntarily choose to indicate their commitment” to the campaign by doing things like starting the day with the “Star Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance, broadcasting daily programming to highlight historical events, as well as showcasing historically significant sites during news segments, such as national parks.

With any other administration, this may have been just a standard announcement. But President Donald Trump and his officials have made their view about what’s important in American history very clear. The Trump administration has already moved to erase portions of American history in a bid to end “radical indoctrination” in schools and remove “woke” exhibits from the Smithsonian.

The FCC’s campaign stems from the Trump administration’s “Task Force 250,” which asks the federal, state, and local governments to participate in the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 2026. “I look forward to broadcasters showcasing its [America’s] inspiring history by taking the Pledge and fulfilling their public interest mandate to serve the needs and interests of their local communities.”

            <h2>Trump Mobile is just Liberty Mobile in gold foil</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">﻿The freedom-themed carrier provides Trump Mobile with a lot more than network access.

﻿The freedom-themed carrier provides Trump Mobile with a lot more than network access.

Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. This week, we explain how the presidential phone company connects to an older company that’s really running the show.

We’ve long known that Trump Mobile was linked to Liberty Mobile, a carrier that’s traded for years using freedom-themed branding to sell cheap mobile plans to a conservative crowd. Turns out, the two businesses are even closer to one another than it had initially appeared. And as we wait for the launch of the Trump phone — potentially as soon as next month, having been delayed from August — it’s worth understanding who’s actually behind the device, regardless of the name that will be emblazoned on its back.

“Liberty Mobile is umbilically connected to Trump [Mobile],” Don Hendrickson tells me. And he would know: Hendrickson is one of the three Trump Mobile executives, alongside Eric Thomas and Pat O’Brien, who have been the semi-public faces of the company. And the same three men just happen to be the owners of Liberty Mobile, too.

The Trump Mobile terms of use say that it is “powered by Liberty Mobile Wireless LLC,” but that appears to be underselling the relationship. During the same interview in which the executives showed me what they claim is a near-final version of the Trump phone itself, Thomas calls Liberty Mobile the “enabler” for the Trump network, while Hendrickson calls it the “backbone.” To hear Hendrickson describe it further, it’s clear that Liberty Mobile handles not only all of Trump Mobile’s technical back end and relationships with the larger carriers, but also many of its legal and financial obligations.

“Liberty Mobile is the company that is registered with all the states, that clears all the taxes, pays all of the different E911 fees, the universal service tax, the different things that each one of the states require,” Hendrickson says. “Liberty has the engineering staff, the teams that work with the carriers, the algorithms that work with giving the best possible optimization of usage to the end users.”

It seems like without Liberty Mobile, there would be no Trump Mobile. But what is Liberty Mobile?

It’s an MVNO — or mobile virtual network operator — meaning it’s a small carrier that pays a larger carrier for unused network capacity, allowing it to run a network with minimal overhead.

Most MVNOs target lower price points or niche audiences. Liberty Mobile is focused on the latter, with freedom-themed branding designed to draw in conservatives, leaning on a Liberty Bell logo in red, white, and blue.

It’s not the only Liberty in the industry. Liberty Mobile is not to be confused with the separate, and now defunct, MVNO Liberty Wireless; the telecoms infrastructure group Liberty Global; or the various Liberty carriers that operate under the Liberty Latin America group.

Its messaging is less overtly political than Trump Mobile’s, and it’s open to targeting other audiences too. I reported last week that Liberty Mobile previously ran Canelo Mobile, an MVNO co-branded between Liberty Mobile and the Mexican boxer Canelo Álvarez, and marketed specifically toward Mexican Americans.

As for its service, Liberty Mobile’s plans are cheaper than the single $47.45 Trump plan, ranging from $17 to $40 per month. They include free international calling, but interestingly not the other perks found in the more expensive Trump option, like roadside assistance, device cover, and telehealth.

Its online presence is minimal, with no social media accounts I could find. Its website still lists a copyright date of 2025 in the footer, and appears either outdated or incomplete in other respects too. The “phones” page is entirely blank; the blog includes a single, 62-word entry on the Affordable Connectivity Program with a picture of then-VP-elect JD Vance; and the FAQ consists of nothing but lorem ipsum placeholder text.

But who’s behind it? Here, things are even more opaque. When I ask, Thomas tells me that he and Hendrickson, alongside O’Brien, both own Liberty and are “the core of” the company.

At first, that seems to bear out. In summer 2024, when Trump Mobile was but a glimmer in their eyes, O’Brien appeared on the podcast The Boon of Wireless and confirmed that his company — Ensurety Ventures — had acquired Liberty Mobile earlier that year. Ensurety doesn’t list Liberty Mobile among its brands on its website, but does list Drive America and Omega. Those happen to be the same companies that provide roadside assistance and device protection to Trump Mobile customers.

But when I ask Hendrickson and Thomas if Ensurety owns Liberty, they deny it. “No, Ensurety is a third party,” Thomas says, in no uncertain terms, while Hendrickson simply repeats “No.” I’ve emailed the pair to ask for clarification, but hadn’t received a response in time for publication.

Their exact roles are unclear too. I asked directly for Thomas’ and Hendrickson’s specific job titles, but neither would confirm them over the call. Instead they said I’d be sent an “official structure” by email. Several weeks later that still hasn’t arrived, and my follow-up email asking for those details has not been acknowledged.

Neither O’Brien nor Thomas list Liberty Mobile or Trump on their LinkedIn profiles — and it’s also not mentioned on the only LinkedIn page I can find that’s a plausible match for Hendrickson, though it’s so scant on details that I can’t be sure. O’Brien is listed as the president of Ensurety, though, a role he’s apparently held since 2001. Thomas lists himself as a founder and CEO of Vmedical, a medtech company that’s mentioned prominently on the Liberty Mobile homepage under the header “Services we provide,” and described there as a “sister company.” He’s apparently been there since 2020, four years before the supposed Ensurety acquisition.

To confuse matters further, state business records all list Matt Lopatin as the founder and CEO of Liberty Mobile, and make no mention of any of the others. So far I’ve struggled to find any detailed information on Lopatin, who hasn’t been publicly linked to Trump Mobile either. The earliest of those records also suggest that the company was first registered in 2018, but that contradicts what I was told by Hendrickson, who said it’s “been in the business since 2006.” I can find no other evidence that Liberty Mobile was in operation prior to 2018.

Like so many elements of Trump Mobile, digging into Liberty Mobile brings up more questions than answers. Still, at least one thing about the company isn’t surprising at all: its registered address. You’ll find Liberty Mobile in an apartment complex at 16001 Collins Avenue in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida — also known as Trump Towers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prediction markets will let you bet on just about anything, from how many tweets Elon Musk will post this week to the next president of the United States, with predictions sometimes showing shockingly (or suspiciously) spot-on accuracy. Polymarket’s CEO Shayne Copland has even claimed that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now.”

However, these platforms blur the lines — in terms of both function and regulation — between gambling and stock trading. As Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal said on The Vergecast, “All of the lines between trading, speculating, [and] gambling are just being completely torn apart.”

There are also ethical concerns surfacing around prediction markets, like whether it’s acceptable to be able to place a bet on virtually everything, along with concerns about insider trading. For instance, a newly-created Polymarket account made over $400,000 in January betting on the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Substack has updated its partnership with betting platform Polymarket, “introducing native tools that make it easier to share, discuss, and debate prediction market data directly on Substack.” Additionally, Polymarket will effectively pay “a cohort of creators,” including Matt Yglesias, to use its data though the newsletter platform’s pilot sponsorships program.

This is just the latest foray of prediction markets into media. Last week, Dow Jones agreed to incorporate Polymarket’s betting data into its “content,” including The Wall Street Journal. A month before that, CNN incorporated Kalshi’s betting odds. In December, CNBC agreed to infuse its programming with Kalshi data. Noted poker player Nate Silver, once a respected stats journalist, is now an advisor for Polymarket.

A claim cited by the Substackers Against Nazis, and in much more recent reports. What if it also promoted service providers that make money from pushing people to gamble on and seek an edge in just about anything?

According to Polymarket, “Journalism is better when it’s backed by live markets.”

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the love-hate (but mostly hate) relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington. I hope everyone got to celebrate George Washington’s birthday in their preferred manner: skiing, staycationing, subscribing to The Verge if you haven’t already, etc.

Political alliances are rarely permanent, so it’s somewhat predictable that the MAGA-tech bro alliance seems to have fallen apart in the span of a single year. Which side the administration would actually choose, though, was more difficult to foresee.

Nevada is suing to block the prediction market platform Kalshi from allowing residents to place bets on the outcomes of events, including elections and sports games, as reported earlier by Business Insider. The lawsuit adds to a growing number of legal battles across the country, claiming that Kalshi is harming the state’s gambling market by operating without a proper license and by allowing users under 21 to use the platform.

The state of Nevada filed the lawsuit just hours after a federal appeals court denied Kalshi’s request to block Nevada from taking action against the company. As prediction betting platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket become more popular — allowing users to place bets on everything from election outcomes to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro — state lawmakers have had to grapple with how to regulate them. But putting local restrictions on prediction betting markets may prove difficult, as the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is rallying against state-level regulations.

Curbed described the scene as “bleak” and noted that many waiting in line for the promised free Tide Pods and milk (which was apparently purchased at an Aldi before being stocked on the popups’ oddly orderly shelves) had never heard of Polymarket and didn’t intend to place bets there. When Curbed asked why:

Because of the word market within Polymarket, per Josh Tucker, a company executive. Get it? Daf Orlovsky, a creative director, said it could work — “these ideas that don’t seem possible could be brought to life at tech-market speed,” he said.

An anonymous Polymarket account, created a day before the Super Bowl, bet exclusively on celebrity appearances during Bad Bunny’s performance, and got every single one right. It’s a little less alarming than the user who seemed to know Venezuelan president Maduro’s capture was coming, but no less suspicious.

First, no, we’re not, and second, I’d be happier if he said he was joining the Celtics than joining the prediction markets mess, as the still-on-the-Bucks superstar says he’s “joining Kalshi as a shareholder.”

Is this better or worse than the days when every athlete was pitching an NFT scheme/scam?

While being banned from the Super Bowl, the two large prediction markets have suddenly felt overcome by the spirit of giving in New York City this week. Kalshi advertised a $50 giveaway today, and Polymarket announced what it says will be “New York’s first free grocery store” when it opens on February 12th.

Polymarket — the same platform someone made thousands of dollars betting on Nicolás Maduro’s arrest — has 48 hours to cease operations in Portugal after users wagered more than 103 million euros (~$120 million) on the outcome of the country’s presidential election, according to a report from CoinDesk.

Political betting is illegal in Portugal, and its gambling regulator says Polymarket doesn’t have a license to operate in the country, CoinDesk reports.

On December 31st, a brand-new account on Polymarket placed a bet: Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, would be out of office by the end of January. It was the first in a series of increasing bets. On January 3rd, the US bombed the Venezuelan capital, kidnapped Maduro and his wife, and killed at least 80 people along the way. The account cashed out with almost half a million dollars.

It would be a misread to describe the surprise invasion of Venezuela as imperial expansion driven by the dictates of capitalism; it is, somehow, worse. Normal capitalism requires a working relationship with reality. Normal capitalism thrives on predictability. The Trump administration is behaving like gambling addicts chasing clout in an attention economy. Venezuela is a fucking meme stock.

Shortly before the US military launched an attack on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, an account on Polymarket made some very suspiciously timed investments. The prediction market had been running bets on when or if Maduro would be removed from power, with prices for “out by January 31, 2026” as low as $0.07 late Friday evening. But within 24 hours of the military action, a newly created account invested tens of thousands of dollars, racking up several hundred thousand in profits.

The account was created less than a week ago and invested over $30,000 the day before the assault, turning a profit of over $408,000. The activity was flagged on social media, with people speculating that the person placing the bet was acting on inside information and perhaps even worked at the Pentagon. Joe Pompliano, an investor and podcaster, quickly pointed out on X that “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

“Prediction markets” continue to appear everywhere, including CNN and CNBC, and Polymarket is shitposting about citizen journalism.

Meanwhile, The Athletic is the latest (following Awful Announcing and Front Office Sports) reporting on sports misinformation X accounts like “Emma Vance” and “Scott Hughes” have spread while sporting those site’s affiliate badges.

Here’s a list of things you can bet on, right this second. This year’s Super Bowl winner, sure. The winner of Survivor season 49, okay. But the number of gifts Santa will deliver this year? The number of tweets Elon Musk will send in the next 7 days? How much money Avatar: Fire and Ash will make at the box office? The next president of of Portugal? On Polymarket and Kalshi, if you can dream it up, you can probably bet on it. Welcome to the age of the prediction market.

On this episode of The Vergecast, we try to figure out where prediction markets came from, and why they’ve become so popular. Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal joins the show to track the rise of Polymarket and Kalshi, explain their controversies and ultimate acceptance, and put these companies in their correct place in the economy. Most of all, he helps us figure out if there’s actually something new happening here, or if the betting has been happening forever.

This is an excerpt of Sources by Alex Heath, a newsletter about AI and the tech industry, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

At 8PM on election night in New York City, I arrived at an unmarked office building in the Meatpacking District.

If you’ve been on social media lately, you might’ve seen the unsettling AI slop videos showing AI-generated people in wild scenarios or just speaking a bunch of nonsense. On Wednesday night, the betting platform Kalshi decided to take this trend outside the social sphere by putting a nonsensical AI-generated ad in front of the millions of viewers watching the NBA Finals — and it apparently cost just $2,000 to make.

The AI-generated highlights various things “people” are betting on, like whether the Oklahoma City Thunder or Indiana Pacers will win the NBA Finals, how many hurricanes will occur this year, and whether the price of eggs will go up this month. It flashes between scenes of an elderly man wearing a cowboy hat while carrying a chihuahua, someone swimming in a pool of eggs, and an alien chugging beer.

Today, I’m talking with Vlad Tenev, the cofounder and CEO of Robinhood, which is one of the most well-known consumer finance apps in the world. It started as a way to open up stock trading, but the company’s ambitions have grown over time — and they’re getting even bigger.

Just a day before Tenev and I talked, Robinhood announced it would soon be offering bank accounts and wealth management services, which would allow Robinhood to be involved with your money at every possible level.

A new tidbit about the prediction markets startup from last week’s issue of Command Line:

Coplan recently raised, but has yet to announce, a $30 million round of funding at a $350 million valuation. And in recent conversations with investors (a surprising number of whom passed on the round, which was less than Coplan hoped to raise), I’m told he was noncommittal about whether the company would work to get the Commodity Futures Trading Commission license it needs to operate in the US.

It wasn’t immediately clear what prompted the FBI’s search of [Shayne] Coplan, the 26-year-old entrepreneur behind one of the most successful prediction markets in history. But Polymarket quickly tied the raid to its track record in the recent presidential election, in which bettors on its platform correctly anticipated that Donald Trump would beat Vice President Kamala Harris.

Bloomberg also reports that Polymarket is being investigated by the DOJ for allegedly letting users in the US place bets on the site.

This week’s presidential election introduced a lot of people to prediction markets.

Kalshi was the number one app in the App Store on Election Day. The CEO of Polymarket claims the Trump campaign first realized they were winning from his startup’s stats, which showed them winning by a landslide hours before news networks called the race. There’s a sense in some tech and finance circles that these betting markets are now a better “wisdom of the crowd” indicator than polls.

The startup has received “tens of millions from investors in short-term loans“ to make sure it can cover election bets:

Like most brokerages, the company offers instant funding to new users. This means users can start trading right away, even though it may take two to three business days for the funds to be officially transferred from the customer’s bank account to Kalshi’s.

US citizens can gamble on the upcoming election on Robinhood, the financial nihilism app announced. Robinhood has termed this “unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold.”

Let’s pause — I would like to reflect on this incredible phrase, about an asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold. See, I thought we all had access to the events of the election because we all exist in reality and can find out about them. But apparently, if we can’t gamble on an event, it isn’t happening. This is a fascinating vision of metaphysics, and I would like to hear more about it. No one bet on my birth, for instance, and thus there is no asset class relating to my existence. So am I real?

            <div id="article-text">That apparently didn’t stop Mark Zuckerberg’s team from wearing them.

That apparently didn’t stop Mark Zuckerberg’s team from wearing them.

When Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrived at a Los Angeles courthouse on Wednesday, he did so with a team that appeared to be wearing Meta’s camera-equipped Ray-Ban smart glasses. Judge Carolyn Kuhl was concerned. According to CNBC, Kuhl warned anyone recording with the glasses, “If you have done that, you must delete that, or you will be held in contempt of the court.” Kuhl also ordered everyone wearing AI smart glasses to remove them. Even after the warning, at least one person was seen wearing the glasses around jurors in a courthouse hallway, although plaintiff attorney Rachel Lanier was told the glasses weren’t recording at the time.

Glasses with recording capabilities have sparked concerns about privacy, surveillance, and doxxing in all kinds of places, and the courtroom is no exception. Earlier this month, a user on the r/legaladvice subreddit shared a post asking for advice on reporting a plaintiff wearing Meta’s glasses to court. Additionally, over recent months, a few states have moved to specifically ban smart glasses from courthouses, including the US District Courts for the District of Hawaii and the Western District of Wisconsin. The Forsyth County Court in North Carolina also banned smart glasses last year. Colorado’s District Court is considering a ban as well.

As smart glasses become more common, though, keeping courts safe from unwanted recording may become an uphill battle.

While a ban on smart glasses in courthouses may be a relatively recent development, limitations on cameras and recording are nothing new. Since 1946, the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 53 has banned recording or broadcasting criminal proceedings in federal courts. In 1972, the Judicial Conference of the United States also adopted a ban on recording and broadcasting in the courtroom and the areas around it that included both civil and criminal cases. The only significant exception to those rules was in 2020, when the Judicial Conference temporarily allowed teleconferencing due to the covid-19 pandemic, although that exception ended in 2023.

On a state level, laws around cameras in courtrooms vary from one state to another and have changed over the years. Most states allow recording in some capacity. However, there are often restrictions, like requiring a judge’s approval, prohibiting recording certain aspects of a trial, or only allowing recording for certain people, like members of the media.

There are a variety of reasons for banning recording devices in the courtroom. For instance, the presence of cameras could potentially be used to intimidate witnesses or jurors, or motivate people to behave or speak differently if they know they are on camera. Privacy and security can also be an issue, especially in cases involving minors, who are often allowed to be anonymous in court records. If worn in court, smart glasses like Meta’s could be used to record court proceedings without a judge’s knowledge or permission, potentially risking the privacy of everyone involved in the case.

Darío Maestro, legal director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), commented to The Verge that smart glasses are no exception to recording bans. “Courts have long restricted recording devices for good reason — to protect witnesses, jurors, and the integrity of proceedings. No judge would allow someone to sit in the gallery pointing a smartphone at the witness stand, even with the camera app closed. Glasses that can record covertly deserve at least the same scrutiny.”

While a phone can be easily put away, however, someone who needs corrective lenses might find it harder to take smart glasses off. If the glasses become more common, rules could become more onerous to enforce. Meta sold 7 million pairs of smart glasses in 2025, and other companies are taking notice — Apple is reportedly aiming to release a pair of glasses in 2027.

“No judge would allow someone to sit in the gallery pointing a smartphone at the witness stand”

The glasses typically have an LED indicator that’s supposed to show when they’re recording, but it can be disabled without authorization and, even when it’s working, easily missed. The features, meanwhile, are only becoming more invasive: Earlier this month, an internal memo from Meta surfaced indicating that the company plans to add facial recognition, allowing users to identify people by name.

Judge Kuhl made it clear that she won’t allow recording with smart glasses in the courtroom. Outright bans on smart glasses in court are still rare in the US, so orders like this will likely be the most direct and commonly used strategy for keeping glasses out of court proceedings for the time being.

“Judges typically have a high degree of control over what items and devices are allowed in their courtrooms, and I would expect that most would respond as Judge Kuhl did here very strongly against any attempts to improperly record proceedings,” Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), explained in a statement to The Verge.

Butler added, “The fact that Meta’s legal team appears to have come to this hearing in a trial over the dangers their systems cause equipped with invasive glasses that put jurors and others in the courtroom at risk is a bit on the nose. But the Judge’s response was refreshing and shows that such behavior need not be tolerated.”

AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views.It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms. Read the full story.

Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.

There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London.It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Twenty years ago, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr was having persistent pain in her breasts. Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares.

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <div id="article-text">The bird is a beautiful silver-gray, and as she dies twitching in the lasernet I’m grateful for two things: First, that she didn’t make a sound. Second, that this will be the very last time.

They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.

I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.

I switch the lasernet on the bird from electrocute to incinerate and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.

“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.

“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”

I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.

“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”

I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.

“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”

The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.

“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”

Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.

LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.

LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.

Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.

LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.

“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”

“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”

“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.

I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.

“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”

I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”

“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”

There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.

I notice she doesn’t say What if  I get what Jordan got? Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.

“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.

It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.

“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”

You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.

We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.

But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.

I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.

She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.

She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”

I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.

“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.

I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.

“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”

He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.

It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.

After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word Please.

When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.

The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”

I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. Stubborn. The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called resource-intensive. But I have been called a waste.

When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.

“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.

After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.

“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.

I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: Killing to Save!

She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.

Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”

I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.

“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”

It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.

Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”

The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”

I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.

I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial. I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.

Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.

I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.

The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.

I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.

I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.

I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.

By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.

I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.

I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.

I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.

            <h2>Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/20/1133365/measles-cases-rising-vaccine-preventable-infections-mumps-hepatitis-b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed hospital treatment.

It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.

The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.

Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years, according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.

But vaccination rates have been lagging, says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”

Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters last month.

Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.

The UK is one of six countries to have lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada lost its elimination status last year.

The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”

Then there’s mumps—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)

Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.

“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.

Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs eliminated the virus’s spread.

Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.

Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).

“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”

All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health. But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.

“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1133360/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-prove-whats-real-and-whats-ai-online/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

            <div id="article-text">A private premiere screening of “Holiguards Saga — The Portal of Force,” the pilot installment of the planned Holiguards Saga franchise, was held on February 16 at ASTOR Film Lounge Berlin.

The event took place in a closed format with invited industry guests, partners, and media representatives. The screening was organized as a formal black-tie occasion and took place in Berlin during the same period as the Berlin International Film Festival, when international filmmakers, producers, distributors, and investors traditionally gather in the city.

“Holiguards Saga — The Portal of Force” is an independently developed film project intended to launch a multi-installment franchise.

According to the producers, the project is structured as a long-term cinematic universe concept, with discussions currently underway regarding financing and production of subsequent chapters.

The film was directed by Kevin Spacey, who also portrays one of the central characters. This marks his first directorial work in approximately two decades. The ensemble cast includes Dolph Lundgren, Tyrese Gibson, Brianna Hildebrand, Disha Patani, Swen Temmel, Lado Okhotnikov, Harry Goodwins, and Sonia Pim Couling. Production was led by Elvira Paterson and Vadim Degtiarev.

Elledgy Media Group, under Paterson’s leadership, supported both the production coordination and the international promotion strategy for the project.

Set in the near future, “Holiguards Saga — The Portal of Force” presents a fictional universe in which two ancient ideological orders, the Holiguards and the Statiguards, engage in a covert struggle over humanity’s direction.

The Holiguards advocate personal freedom and individual agency, while the Statiguards promote systemic order and centralized control. The central narrative follows Jessica, portrayed by Disha Patani, the daughter of leaders representing opposing factions. Positioned between conflicting legacies, her decisions influence the balance of power surrounding a mysterious cosmic energy source known as the Portal of Force.

The pilot installment introduces the mythological framework of the saga and establishes the political and philosophical tensions intended to expand in future chapters.

Ahead of the Berlin premiere, the production team reported receiving formal inquiries from international sales agents, distribution representatives, and private investors regarding potential collaboration and participation in future installments. Previous joint appearances by Elvira Paterson and Kevin Spacey were accompanied by private screenings and gala dinners in Cannes and Venice.

Following the Berlin premiere, a series of additional private screenings is planned in select international markets. Further announcements concerning festival participation, distribution strategy, and release scheduling will be made separately. At this stage, no official worldwide theatrical or streaming release date has been confirmed.

            <div id="article-text">A growing number of startups are rushing to build software that thinks fast. But one of the hardest parts of teaching machines to improve isn’t raw computing power, it’s human insight at scale.

Zurich-based startup Rapidata has just taken a significant step toward fixing that with a €7.2 million seed round aimed at scaling a global network for human feedback, the essential ingredient for aligning and refining AI models.

The round was disclosed today by EU-Startups, positioning Rapidata as an early player in what could become a major layer of AI infrastructure: a system that compresses feedback loops from humans into AI training systems from weeks or months down to hours or days.

Modern AI systems have become astonishingly capable at generating text and images, but they still struggle with nuance, judgement and context, the very aspects humans excel at.

That’s why many advanced models are trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where people judge outputs and rate responses to shape the model’s behaviour.

Rapidata claims to change that by tapping a continuously available, worldwide network of real people, enabling AI teams to gather large volumes of high-quality human judgments far more quickly and flexibly than before.

Founded in 2023, Rapidata sits at the intersection of crowd intelligence and advanced machine learning infrastructure.

Instead of static pools of annotators or traditional data labeling services, Rapidata’s platform gives teams on-demand access to human insight everywhere. That means feedback isn’t limited by geography or segmentation, it scales with demand.

Rapidata’s mission also highlights a broader trend in AI infrastructure: investors and developers alike are beginning to treat human judgment as a core part of the stack, not just an afterthought.

As models become more capable, contextual human insight determines whether those capabilities are useful, safe, and aligned with real-world expectations.

With fresh capital in hand, Rapidata plans to accelerate growth of its human feedback network, onboarding more participants worldwide and improving integration with AI development workflows.

The company believes that the next major scarcity in AI won’t be compute, it will be high-quality human signal, and it wants to build the platform to serve it.

For an industry still figuring out how to scale both intelligence and alignment, a real-time feedback network could be a key piece of the puzzle, and Rapidata is positioning itself as one of the early builders of that future.

            <h2>Gartner $110M sale of Digital Markets division in latest SEC filing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/gartner-110m-sale-of-digital-markets-division-in-latest-sec-filing">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Gartner first disclosed that it had agreed to part with its Digital Markets ( business unit that included its major software review, specifically Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice) business in early 2026, the announcement was forward-looking and economical with detail: it named the buyer and the assets involved, but it left out any financial terms.

That lack of financial detail naturally made people wonder exactly how much the transaction was worth.

It was only later, in the company’s audited annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, that a clearer picture of how the transaction was treated in the company’s regulatory filings became visible. That document, which is public, notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, placing the divestiture within the broader contours of Gartner’s financial disclosures.

This most recent filing, accession number 0000749251-26-000112, stands in stark contrast with Gartner’s prior 10-K, covering the year ended December 31, 2024, and filed on February 13, 2025, under accession 0000749251-25-000008.

In that earlier report, there is no reference to this transaction or to any figure associated with it, consistent with the fact that the deal was not agreed or closed until 2026.

The January 29, 2026 announcement publicly identified G2 as the buyer, and specified the assets involved: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, but it did not disclose any financial terms, a detail that was equally absent from contemporaneous coverage.

In Gartner’s 10-K, the recorded consideration is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” a phrase that signals the number reported in the filing is an initial headline value that may change once post-closing reconciliations tied to balance sheet items are completed.

These adjustments are common in sales agreements and are meant to align the agreed price with the business’s actual financial situation at closing.

A related 8-K filed on February 3, 2026, which included an earnings release, did not include any price details about the sale.

When we looked for the earliest relevant documents, we found that an earlier annual report,  Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2025 (accession 0000749251-25-000008), covers Gartner’s results through the end of 2024 and makes no reference to Digital Markets or the brands that were later sold.

That absence simply reflects the timing: the deal was agreed and completed in 2026, so it could not have been reported in a document covering the prior year.

Thus, the first SEC filing in which the transaction clearly appears is Gartner’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed on February 12, 2026, under accession 0000749251-26-000112.

It is in this later annual report that Gartner formally records the sale of the business and constitutes the first document in the public record to show how the company accounted for the transaction in its audited disclosures.

Reading the February 12, 2026, 10-K, the Digital Markets sale shows up in several sections. Early in the document, in the business overview, Gartner notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, alongside the headline figure that appears in the record.

Later in the same report, in a section discussing recent developments, the company lays out the context around the divestiture, reporting that Digital Markets was classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2025, and listing the related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

The same description of the sale is repeated once more in a note on subsequent events, which walks through the timeline from signing to closing.

Notably, none of these references in the annual report names the buyer. Within the text of the 10-K, a search reveals that “G2” and the individual brands that were part of the business being sold do not appear, underscoring that Gartner’s disclosure is focused on the transaction as a financial event rather than on the identity of the counterparty.

When a company states that a sale price is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” it means the number reported is only a starting point.

In most deals, the buyer and seller agree on an initial figure but include mechanisms in the contract that can revise that figure after closing to reflect the business’s actual financial position at transfer of control.

These post-closing adjustments are designed to ensure a fair final amount based on what the business truly delivered at closing, rather than on estimates made when the agreement was signed.

The most common of these adjustments is tied to working capital, the cash and short-term assets a business needs to operate. Parties negotiate a target level; if the actual working capital at closing is higher than expected, the seller may receive more. If it’s lower, the buyer may pay less.

Other adjustments can relate to net cash or debt, where the purchase price is recalculated based on the actual cash and debt assumed by the buyer, and to mechanisms such as escrows or deferred payments that hold portions of the sale price until certain conditions are resolved.

Because Gartner’s public filing does not include the underlying sale agreement or a detailed reconciliation of these adjustment mechanisms, the exact formulas or thresholds that could change the final amount are not visible in the public record.

What the 10-K does make clear is that the figure reported is a headline number, subject to later review and revision once the closing accounts are finalized.

In many deals, the headline price is agreed on a “cash-free, debt-free” basis, meaning that after closing, the buyer and seller adjust the purchase price to reflect the target business’s actual cash and debt position.

If the business ends up with more debt or less cash than expected, the effective price the seller receives can be reduced. Conversely, if it has more cash or less debt than anticipated, it can increase the amount paid.

In Gartner’s public disclosures, there is no way to tell from the 10-K whether the Digital Markets sale was structured this way or how any such adjustment would be calculated because the underlying agreement and detailed terms are not part of the filings.

What the 10-K does show is the initial figure; whether and how it changes through these common adjustment mechanisms remains outside the public record.

Gartner’s most recent Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, shows that the company completed the sale of its Digital Markets business on February 5, 2026, using language that describes the consideration as “approximately $110.0 million, before customary purchase price adjustments.” This is the only financial figure tied to the deal that appears in the public filings.

The earlier public announcement from January 29, in which G2 said it had agreed to buy Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp from Gartner, did not include any financial terms, and subsequent media coverage similarly reported that price details were not disclosed at the time.

In filings, the phrase “purchase price adjustments” refers to standard mechanisms in sale agreements, often tied to working capital and other balance-sheet items, that can increase or decrease the final amount paid after closing.

Gartner’s 10-K does not name the buyer in the sale disclosure, but it confirms the closing date and the approximate consideration while noting that the figure could change through those adjustments.

Taken together, Gartner’s own regulatory filings tell a more complete story of the Digital Markets sale than the initial announcement did. The only financial detail available in the public record comes from the company’s 10-K, which notes the closing date and describes the consideration in broad terms, but it leaves several questions unanswered.

We also reached out to both sides for further comment and clarification ahead of publication, seeking confirmation of the figures, insight into the structure of the deal, and any context that might illuminate how the transaction was negotiated and reported.

By the time of publication, neither party had responded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Video: Gemini Lyria Music Generation Feature – Socks, uploaded by Google on YouTube

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.
