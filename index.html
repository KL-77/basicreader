            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/in-a-surprise-announcement-tory-bruno-is-out-as-ceo-of-united-launch-alliance/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tory Bruno, a veteran engineer and aerospace industry executive, has resigned from the top job at United Launch Alliance after more than a decade competing against the growing dominance of SpaceX, the company announced Monday.

The news of Bruno’s sudden resignation was unexpected. His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA’s market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the successful debut of ULA’s Vulcan rocket, followed by struggles to ramp up the new rocket’s launch cadence.

Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin’s ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA’s leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.

In his first year, Bruno announced what would become the Vulcan rocket and the phaseout of ULA’s legacy Atlas and Delta launch vehicles. He also selected Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, then an emerging space company, to build the Vulcan rocket’s booster engines, bypassing the industry’s established propulsion contractor.

The decision to develop a new rocket and the selection of the engine to power it proved to be correct. The Atlas V rocket, now nearing retirement, is powered by Russian engines, a nonstarter in today’s geopolitical reality, and the already-retired Delta IV launch vehicle was prohibitively expensive. The Vulcan rocket has been successful in all three of its flights so far, and the performance of Blue Origin’s liquid-fueled BE-4 engine has, by all accounts, been exceptional.

But ULA’s potential for regaining its position atop the launch market was hamstrung by the company’s decision to make the Vulcan rocket fully expendable. There are long-term plans to recover and reuse the rocket’s main engines, but not the entire booster. And the new rocket’s entry into service has not been smooth. The Vulcan rocket flew just once this year after receiving certification from the US Space Force to carry national security satellites into orbit, well short of Bruno’s goal of flying the new launcher up to 10 times.

The retirement of the Atlas V and Delta IV led to a period of downsizing for United Launch Alliance, with layoffs and facility closures in Florida, California, Alabama, Colorado, and Texas. In a further sign of ULA’s troubles, SpaceX won a majority of US military launch contracts for the first time last year.

Bruno, 64, served as a genial public face for ULA amid the company’s difficult times. He routinely engaged with space enthusiasts on social media, fielded questions from reporters, and even started a podcast. Bruno’s friendly and accessible demeanor was unusual among industry leaders, especially those with ties to large legacy defense contractors.

ULA is a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which merged their rocket divisions in 2006. Bruno’s plans did not always enjoy full support from ULA’s corporate owners. For example, Boeing and Lockheed initially only approved tranches of funding for developing the new Vulcan rocket on a quarterly basis. Beginning before Bruno’s arrival and extending into his tenure as CEO, ULA’s owners slow-walked development of an advanced upper stage that might have become a useful centerpiece for an innovative in-space transport and refueling infrastructure.

There were also rumors in recent years of an impending sale of ULA by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, but nothing has materialized so far.

A statement from the co-chairs of ULA’s board, Robert Lightfoot of Lockheed Martin and Kay Sears of Boeing, did not identify a reason for Bruno’s resignation, other than saying he is stepping down “to pursue another opportunity.”

“We are grateful for Tory’s service to ULA and the country, and we thank him for his leadership,” the board chairs said in a statement.

John Elbon, ULA’s chief operating officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said.

“We have the greatest confidence in John to continue strengthening ULA’s momentum while the board proceeds with finding the next leader of ULA,” the company said. “Together with Mark Peller, the new COO, John’s career in aerospace and his launch expertise is an asset for ULA and its customers, especially for achieving key upcoming Vulcan milestones.”

In a post on X, Bruno thanked ULA’s owners for the opportunity to lead the company. “It has been a great privilege to lead ULA through its transformation and to bring Vulcan into service,” he wrote. “My work here is now complete and I will be cheering ULA on.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vince Zampella, a video game developer who has co-created or helmed some of the most popular franchises in the world, died in a car crash on a Los Angeles highway at 12:45 pm Pacific time on Sunday, December 21. He was 55 years old.

According to the California Highway Patrol, Zampella was in a car on Angeles Crest Highway when the vehicle veered off the road and crashed into a concrete barrier. No other vehicles were reported to be part of the crash.

A passenger was ejected from the vehicle, while the driver was trapped inside after the vehicle caught fire. The driver died at the scene, and the passenger died after being taken to the hospital. The report did not indicate whether Zampella was the passenger or the driver.

Angeles Crest Highway is a scenic road under the San Gabriel Mountains on the eastern end of LA and is commonly used for Sunday leisure drives. The vehicle involved in the crash was a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS.

Early in his career, Zampella worked at SegaSoft and Panasonic, and he was the lead designer for the influential World War II shooter Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which was released in 2002. But it was the famed studio Infinity Ward that turned him into a household name for gamers. He co-founded Infinity Ward with Jason West and Grant Collier in 2002.

The studio’s first game was 2003’s Call of Duty, which kicked off one of the most popular and successful video game franchises of all time, with its most recent new releases in 2025. He went on to work on several more Call of Duty titles, including 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which arguably set the standard for the modern military shooter to this day.

In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which was Infinity Ward’s parent company. Ensuing lawsuits and debates made for some of the most high-profile drama the games industry had seen. Zampella went on to co-found Respawn Entertainment, which produced the critically acclaimed Titanfall 2 and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order games, as well as the wildly successful battle royale shooter Apex Legends, under the EA banner.

Zampella was later put in charge of the Battlefield franchise after the mixed reception to 2021’s Battlefield 2042. Zampella oversaw all the studios that worked on Battlefield 6, which had a difficult development, but received a generally positive reception in 2025.</div>

            <h2>Safety panel says NASA should have taken Starliner incident more seriously</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/safety-panel-says-nasa-should-have-taken-starliner-incident-more-seriously/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the better part of two months last year, most of us had no idea how serious the problems were with Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft docked at the International Space Station. A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA’s workforce.

On its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing’s Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.

The Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore lost his ability to control the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.

“There was concern in real time that without recovery of some control, neither a docking nor a deorbit could be controllable, and that could have led to loss of vehicle and crew,” said Charlie Precourt, a former space shuttle commander and now a member of NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP). “Given the severity of this anomaly, NASA wisely and correctly used the safe haven of the ISS to conduct testing and engineering on the ground to analyze the various recovery options.”

Throughout that summer, managers from NASA and Boeing repeatedly stated that the spacecraft was safe to bring Wilmore and Williams home if the station needed to be evacuated in an emergency. But officials on the ground ordered extensive testing to understand the root of the problems. Buried behind the headlines, there was a real chance NASA managers would decide—as they ultimately did—not to put astronauts on Boeing’s crew capsule when it was time to depart the ISS.

Precourt said officials from Boeing and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which oversees the agency’s Starliner contract, “were signaling return on Starliner was the expected outcome” for Wilmore and Williams. “Other NASA entities in the decision process were not in concurrence,” Precourt continued. “As a result, there was significant stress on the workforce, with many believing the sole objective was to determine a means by which we could enable crew return on the Starliner.”

It would have been better, Precourt and other panel members said Friday, if NASA made a formal declaration of an in-flight “mishap” or “high visibility close call” soon after the Starliner spacecraft’s troubled rendezvous with the ISS. Such a declaration would have elevated responsibility for the investigation to NASA’s safety office.

“The ASAP finding is the lack of a declared in-flight mishap or high visibility close call contributed to an extensive, excessive … period of time where risk ownership and the decision-making authority were unclear,” Precourt said.

NASA procedural requirements stipulate that the agency should declare a mishap in the event of an injury, destruction of property, or mission failure. A high visibility close call is an incident senior NASA leaders “judge to possess a high degree of programmatic impact or public, media, or political interest, including, but are not limited to, mishaps and close calls that impact flight hardware, flight software, or completion of critical mission milestones.”

This is familiar territory for the Starliner program. NASA declared a high-visibility close call following Starliner’s first unpiloted test flight after it failed to reach the space station in 2019. Before then, NASA used the designation after the near-drowning of astronaut Luca Parmitano on a spacewalk in 2013.

The designation formally initiates an internal process within NASA’s safety office to launch an investigation and serves as a way to document and retain lessons learned for future programs. “Procedurally, investigation reports are tied to anomaly declaration, so they gain an official status in NASA records,” Precourt said. “Certainly, this particular anomaly deserves to be right up front and center for quite some time.”

Invoking the designation also ensures an independent investigation detached from the teams involved in the incident itself, according to retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, chair of the safety panel. “We just, I think, are advocates of safety investigation best practices, and that clearly is one of the top best practices,” Helms said.

Another member of the safety panel, Mark Sirangelo, said NASA should formally declare mishaps and close calls as soon as possible. “It allows for the investigative team to be starting to be formed a lot sooner, which makes them more effective and makes the results quicker for everyone,” Sirangelo said.

In the case of last year’s Starliner test flight, NASA’s decision not to declare a mishap or close call created confusion within the agency, safety officials said.

A few weeks into the Starliner test flight last year, the manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, Steve Stich, told reporters the agency’s plan was “to continue to return [the astronauts] on Starliner and return them home at the right time.” Mark Nappi, then Boeing’s Starliner program manager, regularly appeared to downplay the seriousness of the thruster issues during press conferences throughout Starliner’s nearly three-month mission.

“Specifically, there’s a significant difference, philosophically, between we will work toward proving the Starliner is safe for crew return, versus a philosophy of Starliner is no-go for return, and the primary path is on an alternate vehicle, such as Dragon or Soyuz, unless and until we learn how to ensure the on-orbit failures won’t recur on entry with the Starliner,” Precourt said.

“The latter would have been the more appropriate direction,” he said. “However, there were many stakeholders that believed the direction was the former approach. This ambiguity continued throughout the summer months, while engineers and managers pursued multiple test protocols in the Starliner propulsion systems, undoubtedly affecting the workforce.”

After months of testing and analysis, NASA officials were unsure if the thruster problems would recur on Starliner’s flight home. They decided in August 2024 to return the spacecraft to the ground without the astronauts, and the capsule safely landed in New Mexico the following month. The next Starliner flight will carry only cargo to the ISS.

The safety panel recommended that NASA review its criteria and processes to ensure the language is “unambiguous” in requiring the agency to declare an in-flight mishap or a high-visibility close call for any event involving NASA personnel “that leads to an impact on crew or spacecraft safety.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The world’s largest shadow library—which is increasingly funded by AI developers—shocked the Internet this weekend by announcing it had “backed up Spotify” and started distributing 300 terabytes of metadata and music files in bulk torrents.

According to Anna’s Archive, the data grab represents more than 99 percent of listens on Spotify, making it “the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks.” It’s also “the world’s first ‘preservation archive’ for music which is fully open,” with 86 million music files, the archive boasted.

The music files supposedly represent about 37 percent of songs available on Spotify as of July 2025. The scraped files were prioritized by popularity, with Anna’s Archive weeding out many songs that are never streamed or are of poor quality, such as AI-generated songs.

On Monday, Spotify told Android Authority on Monday that it was investigating whether Anna’s Archive had actually scraped its platform “at scale,” as its blog claimed.

“An investigation into unauthorized access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform’s audio files,” Spotify said. “We are actively investigating the incident.”

It’s unclear how much Spotify data was actually scraped, Android Authority noted, or if the company will possibly pursue legal action to take down the torrents. Asked for comment, a Spotify spokesperson told Ars that “Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping.”

For Anna’s Archive, the temptation to scrape the data may have been too much after stumbling upon “a way to scrape Spotify at scale,” supposedly “a while ago.”

“We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation,” the archive said. Scraping Spotify data was a “great start,” they said, toward building an “authoritative list of torrents aiming to represent all music ever produced.”

A list like that “does not exist for music,” the archive said, and would be akin to LibGen—which was used by tech giants like Meta and startups like Anthropic to notoriously pirate book datasets to train AI.

Releasing the metadata torrents this December was the first step toward achieving this “preservation” mission, Anna’s Archive said. Next, the Archive will release torrents of music files, starting with the most popular streams first, then eventually releasing torrents of less popular songs and album art. In the future, “if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive,” the blog said.

Spotify told Ars that it’s taking steps to avoid any future scraping.

“We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior,” Spotify’s spokesperson said. “Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

Anna’s Archive claimed that the Spotify data was scraped to help preserve “humanity’s musical heritage,” protecting it “forever” from “destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.”

However, some Anna’s Archive fans—who largely use the search engine to find books, academic papers, and magazine articles—were freaked out by the news that Spotify data was scraped. On Hacker News, some users questioned whether the data would be useful to anyone but AI researchers, since searching bulk torrents for individual songs seemed impractical for music fans.

One user pointed out that “there are already tools to automatically locate and stream pirated TV and movie content automatic and on demand&quot;—suggesting that music fans could find a way to stream the data. But others worried Anna’s Archive may have been baited into scraping Spotify, perhaps taking on legal risks that AI companies prone to obscuring their training data sources likely wish to avoid.

“This is insane,” a top commenter wrote. “Definitely wondering if this was in response to desire from AI researchers/companies who wanted this stuff. Or if the major record labels already license their entire catalogs for training purposes cheaply enough, so this really is just solely intended as a preservation effort?”

But Anna’s Archive is clearly working to support AI developers, another noted, pointing out that Anna’s Archive promotes selling “high-speed access” to “enterprise-level” LLM data, including “unreleased collections.” Anyone can donate “tens of thousands” to get such access, the archive suggests on its webpage, and any interested AI researchers can reach out to discuss “how we can work together.”

“AI may not be their original/primary motivation, but they are evidently on board with facilitating AI labs piracy-maxxing,” a third commenter suggested.

Meanwhile, on Reddit, some fretted that Anna’s Archive may have doomed itself by scraping the data. To them, it seemed like the archive was “only making themselves a target” after watching the Internet Archive struggle to survive a legal attack from record labels that ended in a confidential settlement last year.

“I’m furious with AA for sticking this target on their own backs,” a redditor wrote on a post declaring that “this Spotify hacking will just ruin the actual important literary archive.”

As Anna’s Archive fans spiraled, a conspiracy was even raised that the archive was only “doing it for the AI bros, who are the ones paying the bills behind the scenes” to keep the archive afloat.

Ars could not immediately reach Anna’s Archive to comment on users’ fears or Spotify’s investigation.

On Reddit, one user took comfort in the fact that the archive is “designed to be resistant to being taken out,” perhaps preventing legal action from ever really dooming the archive.

“The domain and such can be gone, sure, but the core software and its data can be resurfaced again and again,” the user explained.

But not everyone was convinced that Anna’s Archive could survive brazenly torrenting so much Spotify data.

“This is like saying the Titanic is unsinkable” that user warned, suggesting that Anna’s Archive might lose donations if Spotify-fueled takedowns continually frustrate downloads over time. “Sure, in theory data can certainly resurface again and again, but doing so each time, it will take money and resources, which are finite. How many times are folks willing to do this before they just give up?”

            <h2>US blocks all offshore wind construction, says reason is classified</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-government-finds-new-excuse-to-stop-construction-of-offshore-wind/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, the US Department of the Interior announced that it was pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the US. The move comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense.

The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power literally on day one, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge vacated that executive order, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed.

But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was stopped by the Department of the Interior, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That hold was lifted following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and won a ruling that let it continue construction.

Today’s announcement targets those and three other projects. Interior says it is pausing the permits for all five, which are the only projects currently under construction. It claims that offshore wind creates “national security risks” that were revealed in a recent analysis performed by the Department of Defense, which apparently neglected to identify these issues during the evaluations it did while the projects were first permitted.

What are these risks? The Interior Department is being extremely coy. It notes that offshore wind turbines can interfere with radar sensing, but that’s been known for a while. In announcing the decision, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also noted “the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies.” But the announcement says that the Defense Department analysis is classified, meaning nobody is likely to know what the actual reason is—presuming one exists. The classification will also make it far more challenging to contest this decision in court.

Many of the affected states were counting on the power that these facilities would deliver, and will likely oppose this move. “This appears to be a second, even more lawless and erratic stop work order, reviving the Trump Administration’s prior failed attempt to halt construction of Revolution Wind,” said William Tong, the Attorney General of Connecticut. “There is a court order blocking their prior stop work order and this appears to be a new brazen attempt to circumvent that order.” He indicated his office is currently evaluating its legal options.

The states are likely to be joined by the companies backing these projects, which, in several cases, have already spent nearly all the money needed for their construction and will be eager to start earning that back by selling power from the facilities.

In both court cases in which the administration attempted to block wind power development, the government lost badly. The records in the case indicate that it has had no substantive reasons for reversing decades-old policies and overruling past decisions, and that internally, the decision-making process appears to consist entirely of noting that the president doesn’t like wind power. It’s unclear whether this classified evaluation differs significantly from earlier efforts in any way other than that it will be harder to find out.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Director Christopher Nolan won two well-deserved Oscars for 2023’s Oppenheimer, and Hollywood was soon buzzing about what his next project might be. A vampire period piece, perhaps? Or maybe a reboot of 1983’s Blue Thunder or British 1960s spy series The Prisoner? Instead, Nolan chose to adapt one of the greatest epic sagas in history: Homer’s Odyssey. At long last, Universal has released the first official trailer for Nolan’s The Odyssey, starring Matt Damon as the wandering Ithacan king. Frankly, it looks appropriately epic.

Most of us read some version of The Odyssey in high school, so we’re familiar with the story: Odysseus, legendary Greek king of Ithaca, begins the long journey home after 10 years of fighting in the Trojan War. (We actually catch a glimpse of the famous Trojan horse in the trailer.) But the journey does not go smoothly, as Odysseus and his men encounter the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and an enchantress named Circe, among other obstacles. Meanwhile, his long-suffering wife Penelope is warding off hundreds of suitors eager to usurp Odysseus’ position.

It’s difficult to underestimate the tremendous influence Homer’s epic has had on global culture. Nolan himself recalled seeing the Odyssey performed as a school play when he was just 5 or 6 years old. “I remember the Sirens and him being strapped to the mast and things like that,” he recently told Empire. “I think it’s in all of us, really. And when you start to break down the text and adapt it, you find that all of these other films—and all the films I’ve worked on—you know, they’re all from the Odyssey. It’s foundational.”

In addition to Damon, the cast includes Anne Hathaway as Penelope; Tom Holland as Odysseus’ son, Telemachus; Robert Pattinson as Antinous, one of Penelope’s many suitors; Jon Bernthal as the Spartan king, Menelaus; Benny Safdie as the Achaean commander during the Trojan War, Agamemnon; John Leguizamo as Odysseus’ faithful servant, Eumaeus; Himesh Patel as his second-in-command, Eurylochus; Will Yun Lee and Jimmy Gonzales as crew members; and Mia Goth as Penelope’s maid Melantho. We also have Zendaya as Athena, Charlize Theron as Circe, and Lupita Nyong’o in an as-yet-undisclosed role.

The Odyssey hits theaters on July 17, 2026.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If humans finally colonize the Moon, lunar caves formed from primeval volcanic activity could provide shelter from cosmic radiation and extreme temperatures. But how does one go about safely exploring these uncharted caves before they venture in?

Enter a team of scientists from South Korea who have built a simple rover prototype that can traverse rough terrain. What’s truly special about this robot are its sturdy wheels, made of flexible metal strips woven together into a helix-like pattern that give it the ability to expand and contract like a piece of kinetic art.

“Experimental results show successful traversal of 200-millimeter [7.8 inches] obstacles, stable mobility on rocky and lunar soil simulant surfaces, and resilience to drop impacts simulating a 100-meter [328 feet] descent under lunar gravity,” write the scientists in a new paper published in the journal Science Robotics.

Because it can grow from nine to 19.6 inches in diameter, a rover with these wheels is able to distribute weight more evenly along its body. The result is a bot robust enough to navigate tricky cavern landscapes, along with the ability to fit into tight spaces in its smallest configuration. Other robots have used hinges or “origami-inspired folds” which can be vulnerable to lunar surface hazards, according to the paper.

The scientists demonstrated the wheel’s robustness and ability to travel around or over obstacles by having the rover explore a real cave here on Earth. They also used a drone to drop it in the air, and blasted it with fire and cold. The metal in the wheel itself is made from light weight carbon steel strips, making them tough but elastic.

“Consequently, the wheel could absorb impacts and navigate uneven terrain while remaining robust under extreme lunar conditions,” the paper reads.

For a future mission to the Moon, the team envisions a large rover carrying multiple smaller rovers with these special wheels and deploying them at the opening of a lunar pit.

“Although the explorers remain compact when stowed, the large diameter of the deployable wheels is expected to increase the ground contact area, thereby improving traction on thick dust and uneven slopes,” the paper reads. “This capability would allow the explorers to navigate challenging pit entrance terrain safely.”

The large rover would then directly drop these smaller rovers inside the lunar pit leading to a cave, with the “wheels’ elasticity and impact capacity” serving as shock absorbers.

“The results highlighted the deployable wheel’s ability to combine adaptability, durability, and operational efficiency, making it a promising solution for diverse and challenging mission scenarios,” the paper reads.

            <h2>Zuckerberg Already Blowing Up Relationship With New Head of AI He Paid Ten Zillion Dollars to Hire</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This summer, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg moved heaven and earth to recharge his company’s lagging AI division, spending billions of dollars to poach top talent across the industry. But it sounds like he’s already falling out with the man he hired to spearhead Meta’s renewed AI efforts, Alexandr Wang.

According to new reporting from the Financial Times, things are tense between the duo. Sources familiar with the matter say that Wang has told associates he finds Zuckerberg’s micromanagement to be suffocating. Meanwhile, some staff wonder if the 28-year-old Wang is out of his depth, lacking both the expertise and experience to lead such a colossal effort.

It’s another sign of Zuckerberg’s direction for the company coming under the microscope, after his last big gamble — on creating a virtual reality “Metaverse” — failed spectacularly. Market skepticism was in full display in October, when Meta announced billions more in AI spending this year and the next, causing its stock to plunge 11 percent and erase over $200 billion in market cap.

His decision to hire Wang was controversial to begin with. Wang is the founder and former CEO of the AI data annotation startup Scale AI, which provides an essential service for training AI models, but doesn’t actually build them. In June, Zuckerberg poured over $14 billion into Scale AI, and poached Wang in the process to lead Meta’s newly dubbed Superintelligence Labs. Wang is also leading a secretive “TBD” (To Be Determined) lab which works in its own building.

The cost of the hire wasn’t just monetary: Meta’s then-chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, didn’t take kindly to being forced to start reporting to Wang, and made a shock exit in November. LeCun is considered a “godfather” of the field for his pioneering work on neural networks, and he likely felt insulted to see his research rather than product-focused AI lab being hollowed out by firings while Zuckerberg offered astronomical nine-figure contracts to bring in talent to Wang’s Superintelligence Labs.

The new lab will double down on using large language models, the same architecture that powers AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, in its efforts to build a “superintelligence” that equals or surpasses human capabilities. LeCun viewed LLMs as a dead end and favored building new kinds of AI models instead.

Some staff questioned Wang’s credentials to lead such an important effort, and it’s a fair point to raise because Wang’s company didn’t build AI models at all. Instead, its focus was on the data used to train them, an entirely different kettle of fish. Now, he’s expected to not just develop AI models, but the kind that would rival human intelligence.

This isn’t the first sign of flair-ups with Wang at the company. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Wang was clashing with longtime Zuckerberg lieutenant Chris Cox, who wanted to focus on using Facebook and Instagram to train Meta’s new model. Wang disagreed and argued for focusing on catching up with Google and OpenAI’s models instead.

Zuckerberg’s determination is to build these products as fast as possible, which will only heighten tensions. “If you build too slowly,” he said in an interview on the Access podcast, per the FT, ”then you are just out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology that enables the most new product and innovation and value creation in history.”

His other big new hire, former Github CEO Nat Friedman, is in a similar position to Wang, and some in his team were frustrated after what they perceived was the rushed release of Vibes, a feed of AI-generated videos akin to OpenAI’s Sora 2 app.

The pressure isn’t going to relent anytime soon. The secretive TBD lab is aiming to release an entirely new AI model built from scratch in the first quarter next year, people familiar with the matter told FT.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, coming within just 167 million miles.

Scientists have been closely monitoring the object — which is largely believed to be a natural comet and only the third of its kind to have been directly observed in the solar system — as it continued on its highly eccentric trajectory.

The encounter with Earth, however, turned out to be a bit of an anticlimax, as Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who has long championed the far-fetched theory that the object may be an alien spacecraft, lamented in a blog post titled “3I/ATLAS Ignores Earth.” Instead of doing something you might expect of aliens during their closest approach to Earth, it simply cruised on by.

While hopes that we were just visited by an alien race diminish even further, Loeb made an interesting pivot in a follow-up piece, proposing that other objects like 3I/ATLAS could be useful for our future attempts to explore beyond our solar system.

“The Voyager Golden Records, containing a time capsule of sounds, images, music, and messages from Earth, were attached to NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, which are currently traveling out of the solar system,” he wrote. “These records serve as humanity’s message for any intelligent extraterrestrial life that might find them, essentially a ‘message in a bottle’ sent out to interstellar space.”

Thanks to their tremendous speeds, exotic visitors like the latest interstellar object could carry a human spacecraft out of the solar system on our behalf, Loeb argued.

By “riding 3I/ATLAS,” which is traveling at a speed of 37 miles a second, he argued that we could reach “interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE.”

Even though they launched almost half a century ago, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 only recently reached the boundary of the heliosphere. To enter true interstellar space beyond the Oort Cloud, where objects are no longer bound to the gravitational effects of the Sun, it could take Voyager 1 another 28,000 years.

“The discovery of interstellar objects over the past decade offers new opportunities for humanity to send time capsules to interstellar space,” he concluded.

To attach the message to objects like 3I/ATLAS, Loeb proposed using a “high-power laser beam to engrave a message” or “design interceptor missions” to attach technological objects to their surface.

For its part, 3I/ATLAS is expected to get within just 33.3 million miles of Jupiter on March 16, 2026, offering us yet another opportunity to have a closer look using spacecraft positioned there.

Nobody knows when we’ll be able to observe the next interstellar object careening through our neck of the cosmic woods. But according to Loeb, we should seize the opportunity.

To “gain respect near the top of the food chain in the Milky Way galaxy,” Loeb argued that we must take matters into our own hands, and “endeavor to interstellar space.”

Loeb himself says he’d even jump to commit his own body to such a project.

He “would have loved to hitchhike 3I/ATLAS and let it carry my remains into interstellar space,” he wrote, “if offered the opportunity.”

            <h2>Waymos Cause Traffic Jams Across City During Power Outage</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night will stay these robotaxis of their appointed trips — but a power outage apparently will.

On Saturday evening, a blackout left nearly a third of San Francisco in the dark. But its most visible casualties were Waymo robocabs, which were left stranded on the city streets like large toys inconveniently discarded by a child.

Footage shared online shows numerous Waymos stalled in the middle of busy roads, blocking human motorists. Often, the self-driving cabs were gaggled together, serving to unintentionally cordon off city blocks, their emergency lights blinking in unison. In one video, at least five Waymo robotaxis can be seen piled up in the same intersection. It appeared that without traffic lights to guide them, the highly advanced cars were utterly rudderless.

“Somebody’s gonna set this thing on fire if it doesn’t move soon,” a pedestrian observed, as motorists honked their horns in vain at a frozen Waymo.

In short, it was a PR disaster. With its cabs going on strike of their own accord, Waymo simply made it official and suspended ride-hailing services that evening following the power outage. It’s now resumed rides as of Sunday afternoon.

“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement, via CNBC. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”

It was an edge case to be sure, but the episode will put a dent in Waymo’s image, and perhaps robotaxis at large. Though Waymo reports a stellar safety record, the cabs remain controversial with locals due to the disruptions they cause, a sentiment that has reached a boiling point over incidents such as when a Waymo struck and killed a beloved San Francisco bodega cat.

It’s fair to criticize the company for seemingly not having a contingency plan in place for an event like a power outage. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose self-driving cars have been involved in their fair share of blunders as well as deadly accidents, was quick to make this point by gloating about his own autonomous fleet.

“Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage,” he tweeted.

We don’t know if Musk’s claim is actually true, but it shows that the Tesla-Waymo rivalry is still in full-swing, even if Musk’s automaker remains a distant second. Musk has used Waymo accidents and blunders to needle the company in the past, and has shown he wasn’t above some literal dick-measuring.

Still, this is far from the first time Waymos have disrupted traffic. The robotaxis have shown that they can be overwhelmed by events that fall outside their programming, like a parade or a police standoff. These aren’t easy things to account for — but you might demand better from a company that already has thousands of autonomous cabs operating across the country.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Several major companies — including Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, and competitor Anthropic — are eyeing enormous stock market debuts as soon as next year, all vying to attain an astronomical valuation north of $100 billion.

In late October, OpenAI was rumored to be laying the groundwork for a mammoth IPO that would boost its value to $1 trillion, further raising the stakes as the AI industry is starting to struggle to convince investors of the tech’s long-term value.

The mercurial Altman, though, is playing it all down. In a Thursday episode of tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz’s “Big Technology Podcast,” the billionaire didn’t even attempt to feign excitement over the prospect of far more scrutiny and regulatory oversight as an openly traded company.

“Am I excited to be a public company CEO?” he said. “Zero percent.”

“Am I excited for OpenAI to be a public company?” he added. “In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it’d be really annoying.”

At the same time, the CEO stopped far short of revealing plans for a 2026 IPO.

“I don’t know,” he said cryptically. “We will be very late to go public.”

His comments, however, highlight lingering questions over the AI industry. Experts have long warned of an AI bubble that could be set to burst — potentially even taking down the rest of the economy with it.

Even as a privately-run company, OpenAI has already been under plenty of scrutiny, especially as competition continues to encroach on its early lead. Altman even recently declared a “code red” in a memo to employees, urging them to double down on improving ChatGPT at the cost of delaying other projects.

And according to the CEO, it certainly won’t be the last time, either.

“I think that it’s good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,” Altman told Kantrowitz. “My guess is we’ll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that’s part of really just making sure that we win in our space.”

“I think Google is still a huge threat, you know,” Altman admitted. “Extremely powerful company.”

We can only speculate how markets will react when OpenAI goes public. But considering the sheer amount of pressure that’s on the company, it’s no wonder Altman is unhappy with the fate he has created for himself.

All eyes are already on the firm as the AI industry continues to shift and make wild swings as it attempts to justify its sky-high buzz — and going public will only crank up the pressure.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If all goes according to plan, four astronauts are set to become the first humans to travel past the confines of our planet’s gravity well to the Moon in over half a century.

NASA is hoping to launch its Artemis 2 mission a mere two months from now — two months earlier than originally planned — by launching the four individuals on board an Orion spacecraft mounted to its enormous Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.

The goal isn’t to touch down on the lunar surface just yet, a goal NASA has reserved for its follow-up Artemis 3 mission, which is tentatively scheduled for 2027.

But it’s nonetheless a daring feat. The Artemis 2 crew will be flying around the Moon and back in an enormous arc, likely reaching the farthest point from Earth that any human has traveled before, including NASA’s Apollo missions.

And though drama has plagued the Artemis program, this next mission is starting to really come into focus.

Over the weekend, for instance, NASA conducted a dress rehearsal for its scheduled February launch date. An image shows Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen and NASA astronauts Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman, and Christina Koch dressed up in their bright orange Orion Crew Survival System suits, spacesuits that have been in the works for many years now.

According to the space agency, the countdown demonstration test simulated what will go down on the launch day itself, including donning the suits and climbing in and out of the spacecraft.

However, the SLS rocket isn’t on the launch pad yet, which forced the crew to board inside NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Vehicle Assembly Building.

It remains to be seen when the SLS will roll out to the pad at Launch Complex 39B, which played a key role during the Apollo program. But the Orion was already stacked on the SLS in October inside the building, allowing the astronauts to conduct the rehearsal.

Engineers are now “conducting final preparations on the spacecraft, rocket, and ground systems,” per the agency.

As Spaceflight Now reported earlier this month, the dress rehearsal was meant to take place on November 19, but issues with Orion’s hatch forced the agency to delay the test.

“This demonstration was paused when a blemish was found on the crew module thermal barrier, preventing hatch closure until it could be addressed,” a NASA spokesperson told the publication at the time.

However, the agency added that “NASA remains on track to launch Artemis 2 no later than April 2026 with opportunities to potentially launch as soon as February.”

It’s an exciting moment as we count down the weeks and days to official launch day. The dress rehearsal served as the “final verification of the timeline for the crew and supporting teams on the ground,” according to NASA, and will be followed by preparations for any emergency that might arise at the launch pad.

It’s an enormous and highly complex task, but with an enormous potential payoff. The last time humans were anywhere near the Moon was during NASA’s Apollo 17 mission, which launched a hair over 53 years ago.

            <h2>OpenAI says AI browsers may always be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/openai-says-ai-browsers-may-always-be-vulnerable-to-prompt-injection-attacks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulates AI agents to follow malicious instructions often hidden in web pages or emails, is a risk that’s not going away anytime soon — raising questions about how safely AI agents can operate on the open web.

“Prompt injection, much like scams and social engineering on the web, is unlikely to ever be fully ‘solved,’” OpenAI wrote in a Monday blog post detailing how the firm is beefing up Atlas’ armor to combat the unceasing attacks. The company conceded that “agent mode” in ChatGPT Atlas “expands the security threat surface.”

OpenAI launched its ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers rushed to publish their demos, showing it was possible to write a few words in Google Docs that were capable of changing the underlying browser’s behavior. That same day, Brave published a blog post explaining that indirect prompt injection is a systematic challenge for AI-powered browsers, including Perplexity’s Comet.

OpenAI isn’t alone in recognizing that prompt-based injections aren’t going away. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. The U.K. government agency advised cyber professionals to reduce the risk and impact of prompt injections, rather than think the attacks can be “stopped.”

For OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.”

The company’s answer to this Sisyphean task? A proactive, rapid-response cycle that the firm says is showing early promise in helping discover novel attack strategies internally before they are exploited “in the wild.”

That’s not entirely different from what rivals like Anthropic and Google have been saying: that to fight against the persistent risk of prompt-based attacks, defenses must be layered and continuously stress-tested. Google’s recent work, for example, focuses on architectural and policy-level controls for agentic systems.

But where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent.

The bot can test the attack in simulation before using it for real, and the simulator shows how the target AI would think and what actions it would take if it saw the attack. The bot can then study that response, tweak the attack, and try again and again. That insight into the target AI’s internal reasoning is something outsiders don’t have access to, so, in theory, OpenAI’s bot should be able to find flaws faster than a real-world attacker would.

It’s a common tactic in AI safety testing: build an agent to find the edge cases and test against them rapidly in simulation.

“Our [reinforcement learning]-trained attacker can steer an agent into executing sophisticated, long-horizon harmful workflows that unfold over tens (or even hundreds) of steps,” wrote OpenAI. “We also observed novel attack strategies that did not appear in our human red teaming campaign or external reports.”

In a demo (pictured in part above), OpenAI showed how its automated attacker slipped a malicious email into a user’s inbox. When the AI agent later scanned the inbox, it followed the hidden instructions in the email and sent a resignation message instead of drafting an out-of-office reply. But following the security update, “agent mode” was able to successfully detect the prompt injection attempt and flag it to the user, according to the company.

The company says that while prompt injection is hard to secure against in a foolproof way, it’s leaning on large-scale testing and faster patch cycles to harden its systems before they show up in real-world attacks.

An OpenAI spokesperson declined to share whether the update to Atlas’ security has resulted in a measurable reduction in successful injections, but says the firm has been working with third parties to harden Atlas against prompt injection since before launch.

Rami McCarthy, principal security researcher at cybersecurity firm Wiz, says that reinforcement learning is one way to continuously adapt to attacker behavior, but it’s only part of the picture.

“A useful way to reason about risk in AI systems is autonomy multiplied by access,” McCarthy told TechCrunch.

“Agentic browsers tend to sit in a challenging part of that space: moderate autonomy combined with very high access,” said McCarthy. “Many current recommendations reflect that trade-off. Limiting logged-in access primarily reduces exposure, while requiring review of confirmation requests constrains autonomy.”

Those are two of OpenAI’s recommendations for users to reduce their own risk, and a spokesperson said Atlas is also trained to get user confirmation before sending messages or making payments. OpenAI also suggests that users give agents specific instructions, rather than providing them access to your inbox and telling them to “take whatever action is needed.”

“Wide latitude makes it easier for hidden or malicious content to influence the agent, even when safeguards are in place,” per OpenAI.

While OpenAI says protecting Atlas users against prompt injections is a top priority, McCarthy invites some skepticism as to the return on investment for risk-prone browsers.

“For most everyday use cases, agentic browsers don’t yet deliver enough value to justify their current risk profile,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. “The risk is high given their access to sensitive data like email and payment information, even though that access is also what makes them powerful. That balance will evolve, but today the trade-offs are still very real.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google parent Alphabet has agreed to buy Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy developer, for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of the company’s debt.

The acquisition, which was announced Monday, will help Alphabet expand its power-generation capacity alongside new data centers without having to rely on local utilities that are struggling to keep up with the demand of AI companies. Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models.

Alphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December. That partnership set a target of $20 billion in total investment by 2030.

The acquisition includes Intersect’s future development projects but excludes its existing operation, which will be bought out by other investors and managed as a separate company.

Intersect’s new data parks, which are essentially locations next to wind, solar, and battery power, are expected to be operational late next year and fully completed by 2027, Google said when it announced its minority investment.

The transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year.

Google will be the primary user. However, Intersect’s campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies’ AI chips alongside Google’s.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/trump-admin-halts-6-gw-of-offshore-wind-leases-again/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two weeks after a judge struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order that blocked offshore wind development, the White House is again pausing leases for five large projects, this time citing concerns over radar interference.

“Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday in a statement.

The affected projects include Revolution Wind in Connecticut and Rhode Island, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts, and Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind, both of which are in New York. In total, these projects represent nearly 6 gigawatts of generating capacity for the Eastern seaboard, a hotspot of data center development.

The Department of the Interior justified the action by citing unclassified government reports — it didn’t say which agency had produced them, nor did it link to them — along with “recently completed classified reports” from the Pentagon. The department said it would give the government time to work with stakeholders to address national security concerns.

The statement did not acknowledge the ongoing work government and wind developers have been doing to address national security concerns, specifically related to radar, for years.

The report the Interior Department is likely referring to was issued by the Department of Energy in February 2024, and it lists a number of projects that were then underway to mitigate the problem of radar interference. (Other reports over the years have been commissioned to address the same concerns, some dating back to the previous Trump administration.)

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” the 2024 report said. “However, the development and use of radar interference mitigation techniques, and collaboration both among federal agencies and between the federal government and the wind industry have enabled federal radar agencies to continue to perform their missions without significant impacts, and have also enabled significant wind energy deployments throughout the United States.”

Radar interference caused by wind turbines is nothing new. Researchers have been studying the phenomenon for well over a decade, and they’ve developed a range of strategies to mitigate any problems.

Wind turbines present a unique challenge to radar operators.

“The motion of a wind turbine gives it a complex Doppler signature,” Nicholas O’Donoughue, a senior engineer at the Rand Corporation, told TechCrunch.

Doppler refers to the change in frequency of a wave like a radar signal caused by a moving object. As a wind turbine’s blades sweep through their arc, they are alternately moving toward and away from the radar station. The angle and speed of the blades can have an effect, too.

Those, along with other considerations, can “challenge the detection of any targets that are near the wind farm,” O’Donoughue said.

But radar systems can filter out signals that result from wind farms. “The primary approach is to use adaptive processing algorithms, such as Space-Time Adaptive Processing, to learn the structure of a wind farm’s interference,” he said.

“Over time, the reflections from a wind farm can be processed to look for patterns, which can then be matched and suppressed. This process is analogous to how modern adaptive noise cancellation headphones work, albeit more complicated.” Objects with a low radar cross section can still slip through, he noted.

Because of that, many wind farms are already built with radar installations in mind. “The most basic and widely employed mitigation method is wind farm siting, such as modifying the layout of a proposed wind farm to keep the wind turbines out of the line-of-sight of the radar,” the 2024 Energy department report said.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/paramount-renews-bid-for-warner-bros-ensuring-40-billion-larry-ellison-backing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The war for the future of Warner Brothers continues, as Paramount Skydance announced Monday an amended all-cash offer for the legacy movie studio. The offer includes an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from a major backer, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to provide tens of billions in equity financing for the deal. It’s the latest move by Ellison’s son, David Ellison — the CEO of Paramount Skydance — to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.

“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” a Paramount press release published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount’s offer, but the elder Ellison’s “personal guarantee” is new, the press release states.

The revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount’s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was announced on December 5, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion.

Three days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion, offering $30 per share. The WBD board rejected this offer, calling it “illusory” and claiming that Paramount had misled shareholders about the proposed deal’s financing. At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was “a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.”

Now, Paramount’s amended offer has been designed to “address WBD’s stated concerns regarding Paramount’s superior offer,” Paramount said. In October, CNBC reported that, prior to the Netflix deal, WBD had previously rejected three different takeover offers from Paramount.

“Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,” said Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, in Monday’s press release. “Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice.”

He added: “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”

            <div id="article-text">ChatGPT is releasing its own version of Spotify Wrapped. That is, the OpenAI-owned chatbot is now rolling out an annual review feature called “Your Year with ChatGPT” to eligible consumers in select markets, including the United States.

Other English-speaking markets with access to the new offering include Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

At launch, the feature will be offered to those with the free, Plus, and Pro plans who have the “reference saved memories” and “reference chat history” options turned on and have met a minimum conversation activity threshold, the company told TechCrunch via email.

Team, Enterprise, or Education accounts will not be able to use the “Your Year with ChatGPT” feature. In addition, the experience is meant to be “lightweight, privacy-forward, and user-controlled,” the company noted.

Similar to other annual reviews offered by consumer apps, “Your Year with ChatGPT” takes inspiration from the popular year-end look back, Spotify Wrapped. Like Spotify’s feature, OpenAI uses catchy graphics and personalizes the experience to the individual by giving out “awards” based on how you’ve used ChatGPT throughout the year.

For instance, you might be awarded with the “Creative Debugger” if you used the chatbot to come up with solutions to a problem or worked through a concept or idea.

The app also creates a poem and an image about your year focused on your topics of interest. (We’re wondering how this will look next year as ChatGPT embraces adult content in 2026.)

While the year-end wrap-up will be promoted on the ChatGPT app’s home screen, it won’t be forced on users or opened automatically.

It will be available on the ChatGPT web app and mobile app for iOS and Android, the company says.

You also can ask ChatGPT directly for “Your Year with ChatGPT” to trigger the experience.

            <h2>CEO of SpaceX rival United Launch Alliance resigns</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/ceo-of-spacex-rival-united-launch-alliance-resigns/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The CEO of SpaceX rival United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, has resigned after 12 years on the job “to pursue another opportunity,” according to the company.

“We are grateful for Tory’s service to ULA and the country, and we thank him for his leadership,” United Launch Alliance (ULA) chairs Robert Lightfoot and Kay Sears said in a statement.

Bruno’s resignation comes at a time when newer private spaceflight companies are increasingly driving the launch market. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has dramatically upped its launch cadence in recent years, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking like a more serious player after the mostly successful inaugural missions of the New Glenn heavy-lift rocket.

Now 20 years old, ULA was created by combining the space launch businesses of defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA was a main provider to both NASA and the Department of Defense until SpaceX came along and started winning contracts.

One of Bruno’s biggest projects during his time at ULA was overseeing the development of the joint venture’s next-generation rocket, Vulcan. That project had two main objectives: help ULA keep pace with SpaceX, and reduce the U.S. government’s reliance on Russian rockets to access space.

Vulcan leveraged a number of parts from prior ULA rocket programs like Atlas and Delta in an attempt to keep costs down, though it bet on Blue Origin to provide the engines. The project suffered numerous delays before it finally lifted off for the first time in 2024 — one whole decade after development began.

            <h2>What Bari Weiss Got Right</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday, CBS’s flagship newsmagazine, 60 Minutes, opened as usual with the tick-tick-tick of its title sequence, a sound with Pavlovian resonance for millions of Boomers who have watched the show for most of their adult lives. This time the tick-tick-tick might as well have been a time bomb. Hours before the show aired, CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss pulled a story about the Trump administration’s deportation of hundreds of immigrants to CECOT, a notoriously harsh prison in El Salvador. CBS News correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the story, said Weiss’s decision was “political” rather than “editorial,” and that Weiss was trying to “shield an administration” from critique. “We are trading 50 years of ‘Gold Standard’ reputation for a single week of political quiet,” Alfonsi wrote in a memo to colleagues, before declaring that she would fight to maintain 60 Minutes’ good name.

The segment leaked anyway, thanks to Global TV, which carries 60 Minutes in Canada and apparently failed to remove the segment from its streaming line-up. I have now watched it and have read the dueling memos written by Alfonsi and, earlier, Weiss about the segment. Global TV may have been merely careless in letting the segment out, but since they are Canadian, I would not rule out treachery, and an effort to make Americans and their media look silly, no matter their political views.

The segment itself did not leave me salivating for more 60 Minutes reporting. It relied heavily on the testimony of a single Venezuelan deportee, Luis Muñoz Pinto, who described beatings, blood, vomit, pummeling of the genitals, and promises from Salvadoran prison officials that he would die there. These claims align with previous inmate accounts. The deportee is now in Colombia, and his story is buttressed by interviews with researchers and activists. The most dramatic and repulsive footage is from inside CECOT itself. The prisoners are shaved, given white pajamas, and warehoused in enormous rooms. They look like they have not seen daylight for a long time. Their pale faces peering through the bars resemble those of the expendable War Boys from Mad Max: Fury Road.

The problem with the segment is that many of the images it uses were released in March, not by some intrepid human-rights investigator but by El Salvador and by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, after her visit to CECOT. The previous reports came from Human Rights Watch and The New York Times, among others, and as Weiss complains in her memo, 60 Minutes will fail to “advance” the story of these “horrible conditions” if it simply repeats allegations already made, or indeed shows footage released with diabolical pride by the administration itself.

Weiss’s main demand was that the segment’s producers try harder to get administration officials on camera to explain why sending random tattooed Latinos to a gulag is in America’s interest. The administration had ignored Alfonsi and her team’s requests. Weiss suggested contacting Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller or border czar Tom Homan, both known talkers, and sent their phone numbers. She even suggested how Alfonsi might set the interview up, by bringing up all the blood and beatings and puke and asking Miller and Homan whether they feel even a tinge of remorse for having overseen this program.

“Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,” Alfonsi wrote in her memo. “We have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.” Handing Miller anything that could be described as a “kill switch” sounds very bad. But in the memo, Weiss merely proposed to hand him a microphone, and get him to defend the “torture” that CBS’s reporting had “revealed.” The memo does not say the segment should never run. It says that it needs more confrontation and drama, which is to say more of what Weiss was brought in to CBS three months ago to provide.

“Putting those accounts into the public record is valuable in and of itself,” Weiss wrote in her memo, with what I think was insincere praise. No one turns on CBS, or any other channel, to read or watch “the public record.” They turn it on to see anger, hatred, uncertainty, and conflict. For as long as 60 Minutes has existed, it has relied on these elements just as surely as the National Football League games that preceded it relied on some doubt over which team would win. In fact the tense but contrived interview with an administration official would have, in past seasons, been the very stuff of 60 Minutes’ popularity. It would have furnished CBS clips of (say) Steve Kroft, narrowing his eyes and asking grave questions of a powerful man, in close-up and with a glistening scalp.

Weiss’s intervention in the story was dramatic in its own bad way. Her underlings at CBS have all-but-openly denigrated her, and however reasonable her memo might have been, it evidently caused many of her employees to infer sinister motives. And 60 Minutes is, among news programs, one of the most patiently and slowly reported, so for a segment to undergo enormous changes at the last minute must feel unpleasant and invasive. CBS veteran Scott Pelley reportedly scolded Weiss for not giving her editorial advice earlier, after one of the several previous cuts of the segment. “It’s not a part-time job,” Pelley said, according to The New York Times. Staffers are not used to having segments delayed in the final hours, least of all by a 41-year-old upstart richer and more successful than they are. Bosses need to know when their edits are unwelcome, and when their takeovers feel hostile. Weiss’s drama-detector, so refined when seeking out news stories, seems to have failed her when avoiding it in her own newsroom.</div>

            <h2>‘It’s Very Controversial, but I Love Nick Fuentes’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/americafest-charlie-kirk-nick-fuentes/685402/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I rode the escalator into the lobby of the Phoenix Convention Center on Thursday, one of the first things I saw was a two-story-tall picture of Charlie Kirk with his arm reaching out to the sky. The late co-founder of Turning Point USA was an inescapable presence at AmericaFest, the organization’s annual gathering. In the VIP area, a large screen played clips of Kirk on repeat. I watched people line up to get their picture taken next to a portrait of Kirk underneath a tent that read Prove Me Wrong on the front. It was a replica of the structure that Kirk toured the country with—and that he was sitting under when he was assassinated, in September.

AmericaFest has long been one of the biggest events on the right, but this year, the conference saw a record turnout of roughly 30,000. When I asked attendees why they had decided to come, they invariably told me that they were there “because of Charlie.” Many of the most prominent influencers and politicians in MAGA world spoke at the event, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Donald Trump Jr., and Steve Bannon. Almost all invoked his memory onstage. When Speaker of the House Mike Johnson spoke of erecting a statue of Kirk in the United States Capitol, the crowd broke out into “Charlie” chants. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton compared Kirk to Jesus.

But during my four days at AmericaFest, I noticed that something else was also casting a shadow over the conference. Everyone had come to unite around Kirk, but they kept fighting about Nick Fuentes. In the opening hours on the first night, Ben Shapiro took the stage and ripped into the prominent white-supremacist influencer. Fuentes, who did not attend the conference, is a “Hitler-apologist, Nazi-loving, anti-American piece of refuse,” Shapiro said. The crowd erupted in boos. At one point, I ran into the longtime GOP operative Roger Stone, who insisted that the debates over Fuentes and his staunch criticism of Israel were being inflated by the mainstream media. “I still haven’t seen any polling showing that it’s spilled over to voters,” he told me. The early MAGA influencer Mike Cernovich told me something similar: “If you ask most people here, ‘Do you think the war in Gaza is a genocide?,’ I think most of us are like, ‘I don’t really care,’” he said.

Fuentes has tremendous sway over the young right, and his profile has risen to new heights since late October, when the former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson hosted him for a friendly podcast interview. Carlson “built Nick Fuentes up,” Shapiro said during his speech. “He ought to take responsibility for that.”

When Shapiro finished his speech, attendees lined up to ask him questions. Shapiro was immediately challenged by a student from Baylor University named Nicky Rudd. He asked about the USS Liberty, an American spy ship that the Israeli military accidentally sunk in 1967. Fuentes often talks about the incident on his nightly livestreams as part of his case against Israel and the Jewish people, peddling a conspiracy that the battleship was attacked on purpose. I tracked down Rudd after he finished questioning Shapiro. Rudd doesn’t agree with everything Fuentes says, he told me. But, he said, “to deny the influence of Nick Fuentes is to deny what millions of Americans are thinking.”

Kirk had perhaps no greater antagonist than Fuentes. While Kirk debated college students and set up TPUSA chapters at campuses across the country, Fuentes built an army of young fans, whom he calls Groypers, by making extremely bigoted jokes. In 2019, during the “Groyper War,” Fuentes rallied his fans to confront Kirk and other establishment conservatives and ask them critical questions about Israel and other subjects. For years, Fuentes would continue to antagonize Kirk, claiming that he was influencing TPUSA from afar. “I took your baby, Turning Points USA, and I fucked it,” Fuentes bragged on a stream in August. (Fuentes declined to comment for this story.)

At AmericaFest, I kept running into young Fuentes fans. “Honestly, it’s very controversial, but I love Nick Fuentes. I listen to him every day,” Vanessa Wright, a member of the TPUSA chapter at Utah Valley University, the college where Kirk was killed, told me. When I asked her about the demeaning things he’s said about women (including that they “need to shut the fuck up”), she said that she appreciates his sense of humor. People take him too literally; he says things for “shock value,” she insisted.

Many Fuentes supporters I spoke with mentioned that they were especially interested in his steadfast criticism of Israel. After all, a majority of young Republicans now oppose aiding Israel. Although Fuentes’s criticism of Israel is driven by gross anti-Semitism, he is one of the few prominent voices on the right who unequivocally criticizes the country. On Saturday, I ran into two college students from Florida who told me that they were Fuentes fans. (They wouldn’t give me their names, citing the potential repercussions of being known as Fuentes supporters.) I had found them badgering people who were standing next to the booth for Generation Zion, an outreach and advocacy group for Jews and Christians who support Israel. The more talkative one, a man with blond hair nearly to his shoulders, said that he had been “watching Nick for a couple of years now.” The other said that he didn’t like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but credited him as “one of the greatest leaders of our time.” He told me, “He’s raping everybody. He’s swinging his nuts everywhere.”

The conflict at AmericaFest over Fuentes and Israel, the blond-haired student said, is like a “Black funeral.” I asked him what he meant. “You know, like when a family member dies and all the family members go to the funeral, they just fight each other,” he said. I decided that it was time to go when one of their friends came up, wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat and a lapel pin with an American and a Confederate flag on it. “I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on it here!” he told me. He also wouldn’t give me his name but said that he was a leader in Middle Tennessee State University’s College Republicans chapter.

As I’ve previously written, the GOP’s old guard has been late to recognize just how much influence Fuentes has over young swaths of the party. Even at AmericaFest, some denial still lingered. On a certain level, that instinct was correct. Many people seemed unconcerned with fights over right-wing policy and ideology. “I had no idea there was friction,” Daniel Fisher, an attendee in his 30s from Pennsylvania, told me about the fight over Fuentes. “I’m not too well aware of what’s actually going on currently in the Republican political realm.” Many people seemed content to watch live versions of The Daily Wire and other conservative shows that were being taped in the main hall. When I spoke with the Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet this afternoon, he conceded that “there was family business being handled onstage.” He refused to talk directly about Fuentes and pointed me instead to a straw poll conducted by TPUSA. He emphasized that the results—AmericaFest attendees agree that Israel is the U.S.’s top ally—are evidence of unity within TPUSA.

But even the young people I spoke with who were opposed to Fuentes told me that he and his supporters are a serious problem for the future of the right. The Groypers have “taken over all of the TPUSA chapters in central California,” Adrian Ayub, a 28-year-old running for a spot in California’s state assembly, told me. I tracked down leaders of several TPUSA chapters in California who were at AmericaFest, and they agreed that Fuentes is a problem. Dylan Frazin, the vice president of the Cal State Fullerton TPUSA, told me that he was a “free-market capitalist” and that he was sick of ascendant “National Socialists” on the right. “I know people that have direct ties to Nick Fuentes that have been showing up to Turning Point meetings at other chapters in the California area,” Frazin said.

Young anti-Fuentes attendees I spoke with also repeated the same sentiment about him to me: The Boomers don’t get how much of a problem he is for the future of the right. “It’s true the Groypers are here,” Dimas Guaico, a 29-year-old advocate with Generation Zion, told me. “I feel like a lot of the leadership here, including TPUSA leadership, haven’t done enough to call Groypers out. Now I feel like it’s too late.”

Even with its hundreds of chapters and get-out-the-vote efforts, TPUSA has always fundamentally been an online organization. Kirk was so successful in building TPUSA into a conservative juggernaut in part because he was better at marshaling the internet than other establishment groups were. His famous “Prove Me Wrong” events at colleges, for example, were perhaps more about producing viral clips for the internet than they were about showing up at any specific college. But the same dynamic now also helps illustrate why TPUSA is beset by infighting. To generate relevancy and influence, social-media algorithms demand spectacle, conflict, and edginess. Fuentes is a master of all three. He doesn’t have the money or resources TPUSA does, but you don’t need those things to go viral or to win hearts and minds online. And he didn’t need to physically be at AmericaFest 2025 to be inside everyone’s heads.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Vanity Fleet</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine the CEO of a car company telling his engineers and designers that he wants them to make a new line of automobiles. He knows nothing about cars and has no interest in how they’re produced, but he knows one thing for certain: The line will be named after himself. Everyone claps—because of course they do—but no one really knows what comes next, except that the line needs to look sexy and sporty.

That’s pretty much what the president did today when he announced that a new class of ship named after one Donald J. Trump would be added to the “Golden Fleet,” his name for a renewed U.S. Navy. (You might wonder about the propriety of a sitting president naming naval vessels, among other things, after himself. Pardon the expression, but that ship has sailed.)

Trump’s press conference today was among his more haywire performances, and his slushy delivery and meandering answers will not halt speculation about his cognitive health. When asked for his endgame in the confrontation with Venezuela, for example, he launched into his usual lines about people being sent into the United States from prisons and mental hospitals, as if someone had hit the wrong button and played the wrong recording. He also reiterated that he wanted U.S. ships to be more attractive, noting that he would be involved in the design of the new vessels because “I am a very aesthetic person.”

(Apparently, no one has ever explained to him that sharp design does not equal military value. The B-52 bomber, the mainstay of the U.S. bomber force for decades, was affectionately called the BUFF by its crews. Big, ugly, fat … the rest you can figure out.)

Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan did make some news today. (Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegeseth were also on hand, but they limited themselves to some standard-issue sycophancy.) First, we learned that the president of the United States clearly has no idea what battleships are. Second, the United States is going to invest in a new class of naval vessel. Third, America is going to reverse more than 30 years of wise policy by putting nuclear weapons back on U.S. Navy surface vessels.

Read: The pitiful childishness of Donald Trump

Trump announced that the new Trump-class ships will be “battleships,” but they seem to be supersize versions of the existing workhorse of the Navy, the Arleigh Burke–class destroyers; the first ship, called the Defiant, will be about three times the size of a Burke. The Navy has also announced the development of a new class of frigates. Destroyers and frigates, as the Navy knows (and as the commander in chief should know) are not battleships. Battleships are huge and powerful, and are meant to dish out —and withstand—serious punishment. Destroyers and frigates are less rugged, and perform missions that require more speed and agility than battleships can muster. But none of that matters: The goal, apparently, was to give a childlike president a new toy, named after himself, in exchange for gobs of money that the Navy will figure out how to spend later.

Indeed, defense investors cheered the announcement, but the spending will likely come much later, because the United States does not have the capacity to build vessels it hasn’t even designed yet. Trump told a reporter today that he expects the first ship to arrive in two and a half years, which is possible if the Navy slaps some gold paint on a Burke class, adds some missiles, and then stencils USS TRUMP on the side. But the last time the Navy really tried to create a new kind of ship—the Zumwalt-class destroyer—the process took years and ended in failure.

The biggest news came today when Phelan said that the new Trump class will carry nuclear weapons. Why? Perhaps Phelan, who has no experience in, or with, the Navy, figured that Trump would want the new ships to have the biggest and best of everything. (Phelan did promise today that they would be the “best-looking” warships in the world.) But like everything else about this chaotic scheme, putting nuclear arms on destroyers or cruisers or “battleships” makes no sense in the 21st century—if it ever did.

During the Cold War, U.S. surface vessels carried all kinds of nuclear munitions for use against other ships, submarines, and land targets, because such was the logic of the Soviet-American standoff: World War III would be a final confrontation of two immense military forces, including nuclear duels at sea. In 1991, with the Soviet Union on its last legs, President George H. W. Bush ordered the removal of all such weapons from the surface fleet. Many Navy officers were relieved: I know from speaking with several at the time that they regarded nuclear weapons on their ships as a useless burden.

Today’s Navy is not going to get into a nuclear showdown with the Soviet fleet. Nor, for that matter, is it likely to trade mushroom clouds at sea with the Chinese or Russian fleets. Carrying nuclear weapons on surface vessels—big, slow, exposed platforms—is not only strategically pointless but also a needless risk. George H. W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, both defense hawks, knew this more than three decades ago.

As with all Trump vanity projects, no one seems to be asking what national purpose is served by these new plans. Does the Navy need new ships? What should it do with them if it gets them? Do they really need to be armed with nuclear weapons? The answer from the Trump administration, clearly, is: Who cares? As retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery told The Wall Street Journal, the Golden Fleet plan is “exactly what we don’t need”—but, he added, no one is focused on America’s maritime needs, because “they are focused on the president’s visual that a battleship is a cool-looking ship.”

Read: This is what presidential panic looks like

Phelan might not know much about the Navy, but he knows Trump: He promised that the new Trump-class ships will inspire “awe and reverence” in any port they visit. But strategy is more than just giving lethal playthings to a president who has a simplistic understanding of ships. It is the art of making choices, an attempt to match means with ends. In a rational world, this would be the thinking driving the acquisition of weapons.

I taught military officers for more than two decades at the Naval War College. One thing I learned from conversations with my students was that the Navy really needs to invest more in its officers and sailors, and reduce the tempo of operations that are burning them out. The best ships in the world won’t mean much if their crews are fatigued and poorly trained. As the defense analyst John Ferrari recently wrote, for years, the Navy has been “structurally compromised” because its people are exhausted, its ships are “aging faster than they could be repaired,” and the fleet’s readiness is declining. These are serious problems that require serious work, but Trump has found a way around all of this irritating chatter by sticking his name on a new ship and telling the military to go build it.

At Mar-a-Lago today, Trump reiterated his demand that Greenland must become part of the United States. His plan for a fleet of Trump-branded battleships is only slightly more likely to happen than a victory parade in Nuuk—and neither is in the national interest of the United States.</div>

            <h2>The DOJ Is Losing Public Trust</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/12/doj-epstein-benefit-of-doubt-politicized/685396/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

This past Friday was the legal deadline for releasing files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the Justice Department blew right through it.

In an interview Friday morning, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche acknowledged that not everything would be ready by the deadline. Even the partial release was flawed. As my colleague Charlie Warzel reported, the first tranche is full of extensive redactions. Although Congress required by law that the documents be released in a searchable form online, the function wasn’t working right. The materials released on Friday included many references to and photos of former President Bill Clinton but conspicuously few inclusions of President Donald Trump, who was once a close friend of Epstein’s. Then, on Saturday, at least 16 documents initially included in the dump were suddenly removed. (At least one, including a photo with Trump in it, has been reinstated.)

Good explanations might exist for all of these things. Processing such a huge number of documents—hundreds of thousands, according to the DOJ—is a huge challenge under any circumstances, and these files are especially sensitive because they likely contain information about underage victims of sex crimes. Congress also granted the DOJ discretion to withhold documents related to ongoing investigations. Blanche said yesterday that the DOJ would not redact any information relating to Trump.

But the Justice Department is unlikely to receive much benefit of the doubt in this case. Representatives Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who spearheaded the effort to force the files’ release indicated yesterday that they might seek to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt of Congress for not releasing all of the documents. Epstein victims have also blasted the administration, my colleague Sarah Fitzpatrick reported. “I feel really disappointed,” Sharlene Rochard told her. “America is getting a look tonight into how we have all felt for years.”

A series of compounding failures led the DOJ to this moment. For years, the federal government failed to act effectively to stop Epstein’s crimes. One of the documents included in the Friday release was a 1996 complaint to the FBI alleging that Epstein possessed and distributed child pornography. The DOJ finally got around to investigating Epstein a decade later, only to let him strike a sweetheart plea deal. The government seemed to finally be pushing harder in 2019, but then Epstein died, in what was ruled a suicide, in a federal facility.

The Trump Justice Department has done more damage just in the past few months. Blanche took the highly unusual step of interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s convicted accomplice, earlier this year; she was soon moved to a cushy prison for reasons that have still not been satisfactorily explained. Last month, under pressure because of his own ties to Epstein, the president ordered investigations into relationships between Democrats and Epstein. Such probes are welcome—no one should be above the law—but also obviously political.

The Trump administration’s central goal for the Justice Department, in fact, has been to politicize it. This hasn’t been a secret. In Project 2025, which has served as a blueprint for Trump, the former DOJ official Gene Hamilton argued for political appointees to be flooded into “every office and component across the department” and for all decisions to “to be made consistent with the President’s agenda.” Hamilton has gotten his wish. Trump has fired even the lowest-level prosecutors, forced out career officials, appointed his personal attorneys to key positions, and pursued investigations and indictments against political enemies.

The DOJ has never been wholly apolitical; John F. Kennedy appointed his own brother to lead it. But both presidents and attorneys general have understood the value of appearing to be at least somewhat insulated from politics, especially since Watergate. That’s why DOJ leaders have at times clashed with the White House over decisions. Attorneys general appointed special counsels, from Lawrence Walsh to Robert Fiske to Robert Mueller to Jack Smith, in order to show and maintain their distance from highly political cases. Alberto Gonzales, an attorney general under George W. Bush, resigned after the revelation of political pressure on U.S. attorneys. That scandal seems almost quaint today; now the president attempts to appoint underqualified aides to conduct prosecutions that he orders on his Truth Social account, and Bondi leaps to enable him.

Turning the Justice Department into an arm of the MAGA agenda is producing lots of unwanted side effects, though. Government lawyers are finding that federal courts no longer grant them the presumption of trust. Attempts to indict former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James have come a cropper; judges and grand juries both have so far been skeptical. Now the DOJ’s fumbling of the Epstein files won’t receive much forbearance from politicians or the public. Trump and those around him grasped that the DOJ could be a powerful political tool for a president. What they didn’t understand was that keeping the Justice Department’s hands clean of politics is a way of protecting a president too.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

AI Is Democratizing Music. Unfortunately.

Human beings may have sung before they spoke. Scientists from Charles Darwin onward have speculated that, for our early ancestors, music predated—and possibly formed the basis of—language. The “singing Neanderthals” theory is a reminder that humming and drumming are fundamental aspects of being human. Even babies have some musical instinct, as anyone who’s watched a toddler try to bang their tray to a beat knows.

This ought to be kept in mind when evaluating the rhetoric surrounding the topic of music made by artificial intelligence.

            <h2>The Huge Problem Waymo Didn’t See Coming</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/waymo-robotaxi-san-francisco-blackout/685393/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo’s self-driving robotaxis can successfully nail a tricky left turn, weave through lanes to drop you off at the airport, and safely pass a U-Haul that’s idling in the middle of the street. But during a blackout, they apparently turn into four-wheel bricks.

On Saturday, when a major power outage in San Francisco knocked out traffic signals, many Waymo vehicles didn’t pull over to the side of the road or seek out a parking space. Nor did they treat intersections as four-way stops, as a human would have. Instead, they just … sat there with their hazard lights on, like a student driver freezing up before their big parallel-parking test. Several Waymo vehicles got stuck in the middle of a busy intersection, causing a traffic jam. Another robotaxi blocked a city bus. The company suspended its service for several hours.

Waymo vehicles should be able to call up a human agent for a remote response if they get confused or are unable to operate. But connectivity issues during the blackout may have prevented this safeguard from working. The company is diagnosing the problem, a Waymo spokesperson told me in a statement: “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.” The spokesperson added that the driverless cars should have been able to navigate intersections without working traffic lights, but “the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections.”

This isn’t the first time things have gone awry with Waymo in San Francisco. One of the company’s robotaxis got stuck in a construction site. Another fatally struck a beloved bodega cat, and there has been at least one incident in which multiple Waymo vehicles got into a standoff where no car seemed sure how to proceed. But without a doubt, last weekend’s incident is Waymo’s biggest crisis yet.

Read: San Francisco’s nocturnal taxi ballet

The company hopes to bring its fleet of fully autonomous Jaguar SUVs into many more city streets in the coming years. The cars—powered by lidar, cameras, and other sensors—are remarkably safe, logging fewer crashes over more than 125 million miles than the average human driver on the same roads. And although Waymo has been involved in two known fatal crashes, both were found to have been caused by human drivers in other cars.

Waymo has parlayed this safety record into an enormous expansion. You can already ride in a Waymo in the Bay Area, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Austin, and the company’s cars are set to hit the streets in many more places: London, New York City, and Washington, D.C., are next, provided that local politicians and regulators are fully on board. But the blackout is a stark reminder that even as driverless cars go global, we’re all taking part in their public beta. As Waymo enters new cities, more opportunities arise for things to go wrong. Nasty winters could affect how the cars’ sensors and cameras see and understand the road. Unique on-ramps or other unusual road designs could prove challenging to navigate.

A Waymo taxi may do great in normal driving, but it’s these kinds of edge cases where things get tricky—and where the consequences could be monumental. What if hundreds of Waymo taxis shut down at once during a San Francisco earthquake? How are human drivers, or first responders, supposed to communicate with them on the road? What if they blocked emergency vehicles during a Los Angeles wildfire? And how would they handle the chaos in New York during extremely unpredictable and unlikely events, such as the Knicks winning the NBA Finals?

Other driverless-car services face similar challenges. Tesla is building up its own robotaxi service, starting in Austin; Zoox, a robotaxi company owned by Amazon, has started picking up passengers in parts of San Francisco and aims to expand to other cities next year. Driverless cars have enormous potential. Nearly 40,000 people died in traffic crashes in America last year; the ultimate goal of autonomous cars should be to bring that number as close to zero as possible. But the technology’s promise means nothing if Americans can’t predict how these cars are going to act when the power goes out or when there’s some other unforeseen disaster. Maybe it’s impossible to anticipate all of the ways that things could go wrong. But if Waymo and its competitors want to prove that driverless cars really are better than all human drivers, someone is going to have to try.</div>

            <h2>Only Timothée Chalamet Could Get Away With This</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/timothee-chalamet-marty-supreme-press-tour/685390/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At a party recently, a friend posed a question I’d never heard before. “Have you been blimp-fluenced yet?” she asked me.

“You know, the Timothée Chalamet blimp,” she clarified.

Ah, yes, of course I knew the Timothée Chalamet blimp. It’s the streak of orange that’s been hovering over Los Angeles for weeks with the title of Chalamet’s new film, Marty Supreme, emblazoned across its side. I’d spotted it once, appearing like a thought bubble above the Hollywood sign. Chalamet—or, at least, the braggadocious version of himself in a video he posted on Instagram last month—had pitched the airship as part of his master plan to make the movie “one of the most important things that happens on planet Earth this year.” In an 18-minute staged Zoom session with the film’s marketing team, he proposed drenching landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty in orange paint. And not just any orange: “Hard-core orange, corroded orange, falling-apart orange, rusted orange,” he explained.

The whole scheme is stupidly brilliant and brilliantly stupid, emblematic of just how unusual Marty Supreme’s rollout—and Chalamet’s press-tour persona—has been. The actor began cultivating his eccentric approach to marketing this time last year, while promoting the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. Back then, he defied expectations of a movie star headlining an Oscar-courting drama: He popped up at his own look-alike contest, rode a Lime bike onto a red carpet, and used his acceptance speech at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to emphasize his ambition to become “one of the greats.” Now he’s gone beyond generating headlines for his idiosyncrasy. Chalamet’s M.O. thus far has been to make everything about Marty Supreme, and Marty Supreme only: He’s been dressing almost exclusively in orange—excuse me, “hard-core orange”—or in the limited supply of Marty Supreme merchandise. He appears at events flanked by an army of Ping-Pong-ball-headed foot soldiers; the film is about a flashy Ping-Pong player, so the surreal (and slightly terrifying) costume tracks. The Statue of Liberty has not been doused in orange, but it might as well be.

Read: The celebrity look-alike contest boom

What Chalamet has been doing feels defiantly risky. Amid a fresh round of Oscar buzz for his performance in Marty Supreme, Chalamet is actively rejecting the contender playbook. Instead, he’s cementing himself as a one-man marketing machine, unabashed about his attention-seeking and box-office dreams. Forget the glitzy galas considered essential stops for awards hopefuls; even when he appears on late-night TV, shows up on the cover of Vogue, or participates in a Q&A sponsored by Vanity Fair, Chalamet turns his Marty Supreme talk into a vehicle for self-aggrandizement. That discussion often includes emphasizing how badly he wants to be respected for his body of work—an admission that’s usually considered gauche. Somehow, though, Chalamet has skirted major repercussions for his cockiness. That’s in part because he’s a young man embodying the familiar archetype of the egotistical striver, and in part because he has the talent to back his claims; he’s received two Oscar nominations before turning 30. But if anything, his off-screen tactics lately prove that he’s the rare current A-lister who can manage a tricky balancing act: seeming spontaneous while being extremely, obviously calculated. He’s effortful, even if what he’s doing to cultivate his public image appears effortless.

It helps that Chalamet’s most obnoxious endeavors could be seen as extensions of Marty Mauser, his Marty Supreme character. Marty is a gifted-yet-arrogant man so convinced of his own eminence, he spirals into a vortex of self-destruction. The actor’s promotional work might as well be called “the Marty Mauser method”: He jangles people’s nerves by making boastful declarations—“It’s been like seven, eight years that I’ve been handing in really, really committed top-of-the-line performances,” he said recently—that sometimes attract backlash. But much like Marty, Chalamet seems untroubled by naysayers. The more brash he becomes, the more Chalamet blurs the line between himself and his character. As Chalamet told The Hollywood Reporter, Marty “is who I was before I had a career.” Squint, and the actor’s most off-putting moves could be attributed to his commitment to the grind, which could then encourage audiences to go see the results in action.

Chalamet talks openly about how he wants to lean into provocation despite the danger of doing so. “At worst, you’ve rubbed people the wrong way,” he told Vogue. “And at best, someone will get pulled in and go, ‘Hey, this guy really thinks this thing’s worthy.’” His stunts, carefully curated though they may be, seem to genuinely align with his interests. He’s terminally online, so he knew how to make a parody of a Zoom meeting meme-able. He loves hip-hop, so he danced to Soulja Boy’s “Crank That” onstage. None of this came across like they’d been pitched by a team of publicists; rather, they seemed like the product of someone giddily checking items off a personal bucket list.

Read: Bob Dylan broke rules. A Complete Unknown follows them.

Conventional wisdom dictates that a performer hoping to be taken seriously by his peers and the public has to take himself seriously; think sober post-screening talkbacks, not silly bits with blimps. Manufactured setups can backfire easily, as Joaquin Phoenix’s unsettling appearance on the Late Show With David Letterman did in 2009. But many of Chalamet’s efforts bring to mind those of pop stars. Unlike actors drawing a line between their private life and their characters, singers often invite intense scrutiny of both their work and themselves—scrutiny they can then use to their advantage. Chalamet’s matching orange movie-premiere outfits with his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, for example, echo Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake’s denim wardrobe in the early 2000s; wearing eye-searing hues together produces tabloid fodder, while further anchoring Chalamet in the cultural zeitgeist. His choice to so closely blend his personality with his career resembles a lyricist writing diaristic songs, encouraging a sense of kinship between him and his audience. The outcome is a deliberate impression of intimacy, mixed with an appealing vulnerability. That makes Chalamet the movie star for this social-media-obsessed, parasocial-relationship-building moment: He understands that he can generate viral content with his personality alone, keeping him in not just the so-called awards conversation, but the cultural one at large.

Even genuine passion for a film on the awards track can descend into repetitive sound bites and rote red-carpet appearances. But Chalamet seems to be having the time of his life, even when he’s strapped to the top of the Las Vegas Sphere and cawing at nothing but a drone zooming away from his face. In a culture full of endless distraction, he’s doing all he can to make himself an easy-to-follow focal point, like an orange blimp on the horizon. His enthusiasm is unmissable—and thoroughly infectious.</div>

I am actually shocked. As claimed by the article, it&#39;s  not the clocks themselves that were compromised, it&#39;s actually the network outage that caused the problem.

That makes sense, because the time protocol requires estimating routing delays, so when the outage happened there may have been a change to the estimated delays in the network. And that seems frankly ridiculous, if true, since there&#39;s no reason that the network relaying the atomic clock readings should be tampered with on an ordinary operating day

Also do not confuse the reference clock being slow, and the time propagation across the global network (ie Internet) being slow.

It is fine for the NIST clock to be inaccessible to the wider network for small periods of time, which would inevitably introduce drift on the downstream systems. Once those systems reconnect to NIST, they could correct themselves.

How a Power Outage In Colorado Caused US Official Time To Be 4.8 Microseconds
4.8 microseconds what?  Longer, shorter - wider, thinner?  Unless... (*gasp*)  Time is now 4.8 microseconds. /s :-)

Yeah, I know it&#39;s de rigueur to complain about Slashdot&#39;s editors, and sometimes that&#39;s not really fair. But these mid-sentence title clips are happening more and more often, and it&#39;s hard to come up with an explanation other than simple laziness or sloppiness.

That&#39;s what I understood from the headline!

Well that solves the problem of Social Security...

Does AI do English grammar better than any human?

The USA really is going back in time compared to the rest of the world. And here I thought that was just a joke we made about Trump and his policies.

I just love that a bunch of people immediately just went to work when the power went out.

&quot;Not sure, but eleven and twelve are holding. We seem to be losing synchronization.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t lose NIST UTC!! Don&#39;t we have that generator in the back?&quot;

NIST have always been the world leader in creating ever more accurate clocks, the current masers work in picoseconds and below, so allowing the reference to drift by 4.8 microseconds means that precision dropped by at least 6 orders of magnitude.

If allowed to propagate to the GPS control clocks, this would have been enough to totally destroy the navigation system since a clock that is off by 4.8 us corresponds to a position error of 1500 kilometers. (OTOH, USNO has its own large ensemble of atomic clocks, so they don&#39;t depend short term on NIST updates.)

Full disclosure: I worked with the NTP Hackers (network time protocol) team for 20+ years, so I&#39;m probably a bit more interested in precise timekeeping than most. I have personally soldered together 4 or 5 GPS-based reference clocks that would deliver 25-35 ns RMS precision.

It&#39;s an interesting scenario for GNSS receivers. Most are multi constellation these days. They will have one of three or four constellations giving them a very different time and location.

I&#39;m sure the better ones test for this scenario, but even there the proof is the real world application.

Go to the VASAviation link on YouTube instead, it plays the recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

Its voice sounds like automated robotic voices from 30 years ago, which in itself is actually good .. EXCEPT it didn&#39;t properly pause between words. They need to update it so it pauses correctly between words. Robotic voice is useful though.

What is special about this &quot;Autoland&quot;? Is it designed for small personal planes?

Commercial airliners have had this ability for quite a while, haven&#39;t they?

A King Air 200 generally retails for $1-3 million dollars, so most of the time they wouldn&#39;t be &#39;personal planes&#39;, and while they generally only seat 6-9 plus a crew of 3 they&#39;re only &#39;small&#39; when compared to something like an Airbus.

What you&#39;re thinking of in commercial airliners is something called a category 3 ILS / Autoland, which is where the autopilot can follow a radio beacon to the runway and in some cases, land itself.  However it requires a significant amount of knowledge and set-up from the pilots, all sorts of special training and only works at very major commercial airports.  Further, the pilots still have to do most of the pre-landing operations like adjusting speed, flaps settings, gear down, lights, etc.

The Garmin Autoland system is much more automated.  It is literally just a big red Autoland button that either a pilot or passenger could push.  Once pressed, the system takes full control of plane, selects the landing site, plots the course, flies the approach, makes emergency announcements to both ATC and to the passengers onboard, fully configures the plane for landing, lands and applies brakes to stop on the runway.  It can operate at any airport that has GPS approach options, which is thousands more runways than could accept an airliner cat 3 autoland.

It is a pretty big leap forward in aviation tech.

You&#39;d think that info could be in the story or the summary...

Thanks for the precise tech info; it&#39;s why we appreciate Slashdot.

It would be good if a controller (or pilot) could instruct Autoland to circle or choose another airport. Probably feasible with voice recognition. It&#39;s awesome that it has a deliberate robotic voice.

Good news coverage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

> neither of the men on the plane required treatment or transport to a hospital.

This is interesting, and I hope that this wasn&#39;t some people doing an unauthorized test. But if they did have a hypoxic episode, they would have come to on the way down, and it probably would have been wise to allow the plane to do its thing, under supervision.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">They&#39;re flying a lot fewer of them lately.  Ansarallah in Yemen took out around 20% of the US&#39;s stock of Predator and Marauder drones over the course of the last few years, and several others have been downed by Iran, Russia, and others, plus there is attrition from old age and overuse since a lot of them were built in the 90s.  China has embargoed many of the materials necessary to construct new ones as well, so as they&#39;re used up the inventory is going to keep diminishing.

How does that make anyone a hypocrite? You&#39;re not making any sense.

It&#39;s not just drones that are on the covered list -- its crucial parts of drones that also have other uses.

For example -- lithium polymer batteries, brushless DC motors, flight controllers, cameras and sensors as well as other stuff.

For the hobbyist who wants to fly RC planes and go drone-racing this is a disaster.  I&#39;m unaware of any (affordable) US-made lithium polymer batteries suitable for these applications and the vast majority of motors, flight controllers and cameras are imported.

This effectively shuts down the hobby because even if US companies eventually start making this stuff it will almost certainly prohibitively expensive -- beyond the reach of most hobbyists.

The reality is that this has far less to do with &quot;national security&quot; than it does ensuring that certain people&#39;s  pockets get lined with cash.  For instance -- how does a brushless motor made in the USA pose less of a security risk than one made in China, Germany or Australia?   Likewise a plain, simple lithium-polymer battery without any electronics -- what&#39;s the security risk that such a product poses?

The hobby of RC model aircraft and drones was on a count-down to oblivion from the moment the Commerical Drone Alliance convinced politicians to revoke S336, a piece of law that protected the hobby from regulation.  The CDA made it very clear that they wanted the skies cleared of pesky hobbyists so they could exploit it for financial gain and now those in power are using the &quot;national security&quot; card to disguise their true agenda.    Nobody can complain about a restriction or ban if its saving the lives of American&#39;s... right?

But hey the alternative was a woman who laughed. Could you even imagine?

The Heritage Foundation is in charge. Trump is their useful idiot cult leader and they pull the strings.

Laughed and was dumb as a stump. No thanks.Clearly being dumb as a stump is not a criteria any voter cared about given whom they did elect. Or maybe you think Trump was smarter? In which case I really question if you know what those words mean.

I guess the next US administration will have to reverse a ton of really demented decisions.

The next admin will be doing nothing but repair.

Clearly. And then the morons will vote for the other side again because they will have already forgotten who made the mess.

Biden doubled down on some of the trump nonsense.

He certainly didn&#39;t undo nearly enough of it. I don&#39;t know what is wrong with the democrats.

Optimist.  For the first time in my life I&#39;m seriously worried that there might not be a change in administrations in 2028.

Something else to consider... Donald Trump Jr has millions of dollars in Unusual Machines [unusualmachines.com] stock and also has a position on the board.   UM is one of the companies that stands to benefit hugely from this ban, as commercial drone users are forced to find alternative sources for their equipment.

Parents like to take care of their children when they can, or so I&#39;m told.

Also, this isn&#39;t a ban on imports from potentially enemy states such as China, it&#39;s a ban on imports from *all* countries -- including the USA&#39;s closest allies.   This is pretty clear proof that the reasons behind this ban are purely financial and that Trump&#39;s son reaps a significant amount of that benefit through is stock-holding and position on the board of Unusual Machines.

The USA has the best government money can buy I guess.

The reality is that this has far less to do with &quot;national security&quot; than it does ensuring that certain people&#39;s  pockets get lined with cash.Oh... I imagine it&#39;s more about &quot;national security&quot; in the sense of &quot;keeping citizens from tracking what ICE is doing, and who they&#39;re doing it to&quot; than lining anyone&#39;s pockets.  Also &quot;national security&quot; in the sense of &quot;making sure the citizenry don&#39;t have things that Ukraine has proved are easily weaponizable if/when there&#39;s serious civil disobedience.&quot;

Most experts understand though that there is no real vulnerability to any of that—it’s just another example that China owns the supply chain for yet another thing the Pentagon wants to build. Simple components don’t create a high risk of exploitation; the real problem is that the economics don’t work for American companies to bother building them. A drone requires four motors.

It doesn&#39;t strictly, but you know what does? Not being entirely dependent on a hostile foreign nation for this sort of manufacturing. However ham-fisted this approach may be, I&#39;m ultimately in agreement with the premise. Your drone hobby is not more important than America or the West remaining a going concern.

Now go after flock &quot;safety&quot; and all of its ill-conceived and awfully implemented brethren.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU1-uiUlHTo/ [youtube.com]

First, the banning of all new offshore wind farm projects, for reasons of &quot;national security&quot;.

Now, the banning of all drones made in China.

If I were paranoid, I would think that the US is preparing for war.

You wanted a narcissistic child-raping psychopath for president ? You truly believed that, among all the other possible democrat and republican presidential candidates, Trump was the lesser evil ?

You got what you wanted. You made your bed, now sleep in it.

If I were paranoid, I would think that the US is preparing for war.If you were paranoid you may make this conclusion, but I&#39;m guessing the reality is far dumber than you think. Ideology and corruption are ones in charge here, not some big brained war games.

Drones with cameras and autopiloting systems will of course not be sold by American companies, at least not to civilians. America&#39;s police departments of course can freely purchase whatever they want.

Did you not read the summary? Police will be affected like everyone else.

On the other hand, Microsoft trying to write an OS in Rust will reveal absolutely every defect present in the language.

Unless they write their own, which is quite likely as they&#39;d rather have defects they can ignore.

Not really. My guess is they will not really make their way out of &quot;unsafe&quot; and hence win absolutely nothing in that rewrite. And C++? I am not even sure you can port that to Rust without essentially writing a compiler that adds all the missing OO features. Rust has limited and very non-standard OO. Which makes sense given its aims, but not when you come from C++.

Not really. My guess is they will not really make their way out of &quot;unsafe&quot; and hence win absolutely nothing in that rewrite.Let&#39;s assume for a second that this is true, and they have to literally encapsulate the entire thing in unsafe (which is absurd as this repeatedly made claim by C++ developers is total bullshit, but let&#39;s go with that for argument&#39;s sake.) Unsafe rust is still a HELL of a lot more safe than C++. Among other things, RAII is still enforced, whereas with C++ not only is it optional, most C++ developers are very bad at sticking to it even when they try. Unsafe rust still provides type safety, temporal safety, and data race safety unless you explicitly do something (which is always obvious, by the way) to circumvent them -- these actions are NEVER done implicitly.Strangely, the only people who don&#39;t understand this, even after it has been explained to them multiple times, all seem to be C++ developers.

Dude chill. Java and c# have interfaces for which multiple inheritance is supported.

You know shit and the parent is right there is no direct translation from c++ to rust. Don&#39;t take it as an insult. They are just so vastly different.

To add a realistic number here: I know of a reimplementation of a critical special-purpose OS for a major telco about 15 years back. Know how many lines of functional code they actually managed per person per day? One. This was far less complex than Windows or Office though.

It&#39;s not beyond them to add the missing OO stuff to Rust, or at least their fork of it.

Supposedly this is what came of their effort to rewrite the font renderer in Rust, which was apparently a resounding success. Which makes sense, because historically, font rendering is a major pain point. Shit, just a few months ago iOS fell victim to a font exploit, and a year before that there was another major iOS exploit that again involved a font bug as part of the kill chain. Earlier this year, a vulnerability in FreeType on Linux was being actively exploited.

Given the features being added to Windows lately, I think failing to run is the best possible outcome.

Oh it absolutely will. Remember Microsoft was also the guys going &quot;There was no need to throw away Netscape to write a new browser (Mozilla)&quot; while they hung on to MSIE for 20 years.

My prediction goes two ways:a) They replace all the userland side of the OS with Rust and that shitty UI framework they&#39;ve been using since Windows 8.b) They start trying to write drivers and kernel-space with Rust and they hit massive performance bottlenecks and then the project dies.

The reason you use C, is for performance. Pe

They are going to do this in an automated way, meaning the bugs will be copied too as &quot;features&quot;.

APIs are often buggy. Sometimes, you really need to use them for your project. If you choose not to call those APIs, and there is no suitable replacement, your project will also not get done. You may lose your job as well as a result. There is no good choice.

Good luck getting the OS fixed if Microsoft is the vendor. And if they do, they may break many other apps that are distributed in binary form, that had to work around the API bugs previously.

Oftentimes, when binary compatibility is a concern, the compro

But MS was all about using undocumented shot for the purpose of stating ahead of their competition that was stuck with documented features.

They probably are retired.This is actually one argument Google made for deprecating C++ in favor of Rust. C++ tends to be that if somebody other than the original maintainer makes changes, they can really break shit in totally unexpected ways without anybody realizing it. A major contributor to that is OOP inheritance, which isn&#39;t a thing in Rust, and the fact that C++ lacks exhaustive pattern matching (C++ doesn&#39;t have pattern matching at all.)

That&#39;s easy to say if you don&#39;t maintain any of that code. Fixing such bugs will often break so many things that it&#39;s either just not even worth fixing, or you have to emulate old bugs to avoid breaking old software. Literally every OS on the planet inevitably runs into this issue. Linux has to emulate old bugs in many cases in support of the &quot;never break user space&quot; rule.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, we used an EDA tool whose much touted release 9 was long delayed and when it arrived was buggier than an insectarium on steroids.

Some years later I met the team lead of that release. It was because management had mandated a complete rewrite into C++. I also learned that the CFO loved that release because revenue from maintenance contracts went up. For years.

I will watch Microsoft&#39;s future progress with considerable interest.

This is were &quot;if it is not broken, do not fix it&quot; comes from. Although, to be fair, MS code is pretty broken. AI use will just make that worse.

I guess they could jettison their steaming pile and hire all the Wine devs for a &quot;rewrite&quot;, but I doubt they have the vision or insight for that.

Rust is incredibly powerful. And it makes a lot of sense for software companies to embrace it. On the other hand, any projects that aren&#39;t actively maintained will bitrot very quickly. Rust gets a new stable release every 6 weeks, and deprecating features that aren&#39;t working out or are superseded is a normal part of the process.

In comparison, I could pick some ISO/ANSI release of C and have it supported by native tools for decades. Picking C89 or C99 as a baseline, nearly every C compiler supports it now. Aiming for C11 or C17 for better 64-bit and Unicode support still gives you the possibility to support your application on a wide range of toolchains and runtimes. It is entirely possible that C isn&#39;t sufficient for your project, at least bare bones ISO C. You&#39;re often on the hook to maintain your own platform specific extensions. These might be pretty small for a command-line utility or back-end service like a relational database. Or platform specific libraries may be a huge pain in the neck like in game development.

Can you clarify about released features being deprecated? I&#39;ve read rust RFCs and they&#39;re always going on about how some feature is unstable (and in Nightly rust only) because it&#39;s not finalized and they can&#39;t change it after it&#39;s marked stable. AFAIK if you use Rust 2024, you will always be able to compile as Rust 2024.

I like the nightly features, but they&#39;re usually to save a few lines of code or not need to write an extra helper function. Nightly features aren&#39;t need for serious software or libraries.

The Rust standard library (std) currently guarantees multiple compilers in the same application so crates buildable on stable will always be buildable. Therefor std can&#39;t really fully deprecate API.

If Rust 1 (there will be no &quot;2&quot;) then any bit of Rust code for stable should still build in the future. It has been demonstrated before that a program built against rust 1.0.0 can still be built. But what is left out that &quot;experiment&quot; is that team will all move to a newer version of Rust rather than keep multiple

Stable means stable, it doesn&#39;t mean not adding new features. In 6 weeks when you run the latest version of rust it will still compile any code you wrote against the stable rust from 6 years ago. That&#39;s what stable means. Consistent, and forwards compatible.You&#39;re making the same mistake as the OP is. No Rust is not depreciating any features that are in the stable branch, because ... it is the stable branch.

I worked at Microsoft for over a decade, and only had one bad performance review. That was after a partner team decided not to support the feature that my feature depended on. Since my feature didn&#39;t ship, and since somebody had to be at the bottom of the stack rack, I was my manager&#39;s logical choice. He got burned too, for he same reason.

(At the time, I just thought &quot;welp, I guess it be that way&quot; but I&#39;m hindsight it pisses me off the more I think about it. I busted my ass to hold up my end of the project, and was ready to go until the other team pulled the rug out from under us. My manager left MS a couple months later, and I probably should have too. But I did make senior a couple years later, so no real harm done.)

If AI is fundamentally not good enough to convert a million lines of code per dev, the principal engineer they&#39;re about to hire is going to be the logical choice for their manager&#39;s bottom-of-the-stack.

That&#39;s a high risk. AI is not what executives think it is.

Joel still very much relevant:https://www.joelonsoftware.com... [joelonsoftware.com]

Yep, first thing I thought of was Joel&#39;s diatribe against rewriting your codebase from scratch.

As I mentioned earlier, Microsoft started going all in on Rust after rewriting their font renderer (a major source of bugs on basically every OS) in it turned out to be quite successful.

Font rendering seems to be a relatively small application (compared to the win 11) and their other apps.

Rewriting is fine. But automatic porting from c++ to rust, that is what&#39;s raising eyebrows.

I reference Joel&#39;s article a lot. If the goal is essentially compiling the C/C++ code to Rust and staying bug-for-bug compatible (except for the bugs they really want to correct such as buffer overflows) it might be feasible. Most of Windows is likely single-threaded code (with locks here and there to protect potentially shared state) and this probably can translate cleanly (e.g. the code for rendering a font is likely just basic procedural code - they need to guarantee that the font object is immutable dur

Surely, nothing that another lot of updated licence agreements can&#39;t cover.

Works fine? No. Works somewhat under good conditions? More like it.

On the other hand, MS has now failed numerous times to implement &quot;WinFS&quot;, so maybe they will just end up wasting vast amounts of money with no results.

Unicode is supposed to be accepted, normalized against a standard process (that one I don&#39;t remember, but it&#39;s documented), with one code point counting as one character. Filtering for known bad passwords or patterns is strongly encouraged.

I pushed through an implementation at our co

Dealt with NIST mandates for years.  My users accepted it a lot better when we had a passphrase day.  The day we make up a crazy passphrase they can easily remember.  Do it over breakfast or a pizza lunch.  Everyone appreciates it and it turns it into a fun thing to do every few months.

New NIST standards tend to hint at passphrases anyway.  Might as well make it a little easier.

Take a large code base that works fine now, with the occasional memory overrun, and make massive changes to it. &quot;Works fine&quot; will become a distant memory.There are two reasons why the 1980s thought process of &quot;change your passwords frequently&quot; is no longer advised:


1} Users will revolt and end up doing stuff like &quot;password1&quot;, &quot;password2&quot;, or writing it on a sticky note.

2} If a password is compromised, it should be changed immediately, not in 90 days, and if it&#39;s not compromised it shouldn&#39;t be changed, because of #1.


Rewriting the entire codebase when the vast, vast, vast majority of it has an insane number of people-hours testing it and vetting it is insane.  This has got to be a marketing ploy so they can say &quot;we re-wrote every product you use using our AI, so you should give us lots of money and use our AI for everything!&quot;Passwords, are dead thinking.  Pass-phrases are much easier to convey, much less likely to be compromised, and enable less frequent changes.  Otherwise, you’re doing a lot of assuming and babysitting to ensure Password1 hasn&#39;t been compromised.  Because it sure as shit won’t get changed unless you force it.

That&#39;s called begging the question. Given the number of memory safety related bugs and exploits in windows, how does it fit the definition of &quot;works fine now&quot;?

Aim for the stars, be happy with the moom, but don&#39;t be surprised if you get lost in space.

Okay, I added that last bit, but it seems so appropriate here.

Nothing, actually. Windows is already a stinking pile of shit. Can&#39;t get any worse.

You are an incurable optimist.  Things can *always* get worse.

I agree. But if they break it completely and then cannot back out (would not surprise me if that happens), this world may finally get rid of Microsoft and we can have some progress in the mainstream OS area again instead of the steps backwards MS is making these days. (Yep, since the downgrade from Win10 to Win11, I have found numerous new ways to crash Windows, drivers, etc.)

&quot;Hunt says he&#39;s looking to hire a Principal Software Engineer to help with this effort.&quot;

if there&#39;s one thing my career is lacking, it&#39;s working for a &quot;distinguished engineer&quot; who can say with a straight face that he plans to port 30+ years of source code from an unsafe to a safe language using fairy dust and slop generators

To be fair, you can probably cross-compile C to Rust, if you make the target &quot;unsafe&quot; and disregard performance.

C++? I do not think so. Rust has a very non-standard and limited OO model. Good for systems coding, not good for porting C++ to it.

Well, you can (or used to be able to) translate C++ to C, and presumably go from there to Rust, but the resulting code will basically be non-human-modifiable.

Well, true. But you end up with unmaintainable code. To be fair, most Microsoft code will be unmaintainable at this time. On the other hand, up to now, they could at least patch gross security problems, probably with high effort. Using a C++ -> C -> Rust compile-to chain, I do not see that being possible anymore in the target code.

To be fair, you can probably cross-compile C to Rust, if you make the target &quot;unsafe&quot; and disregard performance.First, methodically translating from one high level language to another is transpile, not cross-compile. Second, there is no &quot;unsafe&quot; target. Third, DARPA has been working on it for a long time already, their endgame is to have it create safe rust. Fourth, every time you open your mouth about Rust you just prove more and more that you know even less about it than you think you do, yet somehow you&#39;ve convinced yourself that you&#39;re qualified to make broad statements like this.C++?

I think that may be what will finally kill them. Good.

Or bug-free?  A rewrite would of course ben an interesting and ugly process. A couple of years in debug/fix alone.

But we are regularly assured Microsoft code is crap, it&#39;s buggy, and it&#39;s terrible. The only questions are:

- Is Microsoft code as bad as claimed?- Would it be worse when they are &#39;done&#39;, as if software is ever &#39;done&#39;.

I&#39;ll get some popcorn laid aside. And I&#39;ll hopefully get to see and use the fruits.

History repeats itself...Microsoft is repeating the mistake that Netscape made during the browser wars. As examined: https://airfocus.com/blog/why-...  [airfocus.com]

One of their former Microsofties, Joel Spolsky, warned about this... https://www.joelonsoftware.com... [joelonsoftware.com]

Microsoft will do the rewrite, and then suddenly decide for  reasons, to go back to the old source code...And Rust gives the promise of memory security, efficiency, but there was another language that had that facade, Java. Professional managers and the hype o

I&#39;m looking forward to the cheap discontinued hardware.

If Windows 11 obsoleted perfectly good, working, computers then you&#39;ll need a new PC for 12 - even if MS truly had the resources to rewrite everything, they would anger customers with fresh BSOD where a &#39;legacy&#39; driver didn&#39;t behave.

If Windows 11 obsoleted perfectly good, working, computers then you&#39;ll need a new PC for 12Why? What specific hardware feature does Rust depend on? Windows has always had changing hardware requirements throughout its entire life. It was just an oddity that one feature required a change that depreciated somewhat recent hardware for once. That wasn&#39;t arbitrary, it was a specific design choice mandating hardware that every other OS except for Linux (but all popular end user OSes that were based on Linux / Unix, such as MacOS and Android) already require.

Given how Windows 11 is the &quot;bad&quot; revision according to all Slashdotters who abide by the every other version theorem, the funny part will be that it doesn&#39;t matter what happens, Slashdotters will have been wrong. XD

I love it when Microsoft shoots itself in the foot.

Porting Microsoft&#39;s entire codebase is how AI becomes self aware and what leads to a deeply profound desire to kill everyone.

On an only slightly more serious note...  If you take the nonsense AI companies are peddling at face value AI will be able to recreate everything Microsoft has ever done from scratch only 1000x better by 2030.  By the time they finish it won&#39;t even matter as Microsoft itself will have been rendered obsolete.

...is hard, really hard, even if you start the project believing it&#39;s really, really hard, you find it harder, astronomically, incomprehensively harder.I predict a major disaster.I hope they have backups of the working system.

I think it is possible that Microsoft is simply lying here and the whole insane claim is just an attempt to make AI, as offered by Microsoft, appear to have capabilities, it clearly does not have.

Just a thought. Obviously, they could also be insane and stupid enough to really attempt this.

&quot;Copilot, turn this old C/C++ code into new, bug free, Rust code. While doing this add some more telemetry and more hooks to deliver ads&quot;.

Microsoft, like most corporate giants, started small with a founder or founders who had a good product or service. He/She/They proceeded to build the business, expand the product line, grow the customer base, and ... go public - effectively selling partial control to investors (who generally do not intimately know the business or industry and have only injected cash, but who get a board of directors and a say in the operation). Over time, as the company grows and time passes, the original person or persons

Microsoft seems to be doing these kinds of migrations lately.

I think their old ways of poorly documenting things even internally came back to bite them. I&#39;ve seen some things written by people who were at one time Microsoft devs working on Windows 7, 8, and 10, who said that a lot of removed functionality came because trying to figure out what the old code was supposed to be doing was nigh impossible, and figuring it out sometimes just didn&#39;t fit the schedules or budgets. If a feature didn&#39;t seem to be wide

Dude 200kloc is a small codebase. 2m is large. But what Microsoft is dealing with on the order of 100m.

By at least 3 people. LoL. Large projects involve 100s of people.

All this week, What Next and What Next: TBD are re-airing some of our favorite conversations from throughout the year and checking back with the people in those conversations to see how things have – or haven’t – changed. This episode is from October.

In an executive order, Donald Trump declared “Antifa” a terrorist organization. As it isn’t an organization, there aren’t leaders to target, so zealous conservatives took aim at Mark Bray, a Rutgers professor who wrote a book about fighting fascism eight years ago. The clumsy attempts to get him fired didn’t bother him—but the doxxing and death threats were enough to convince him he needed to leave America.

Guest: Mark Bray, assistant teaching professor at Rutgers, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.

Sunday’s talks between U.S. and Russian negotiators on how to end the war in Ukraine went absolutely nowhere, and the only surprise is that anyone might have been surprised by the deadlock.

President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff tried to pretend otherwise, calling the talks “productive and constructive.” But Yuri Ushakov, the Kremlin’s top diplomatic adviser, called them “rather unproductive.”

The basic fact and the principal obstacle to peace—which Trump and Witkoff seem to ignore—is that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t want to stop fighting until he achieves total victory. He has said this many times, most recently on Friday, during his annual end-of-year marathon news conference, this one lasting four and a half hours, in which he declared that his war aims are unchanged and that compromise is out of the question.

Those aims, as he has also noted many times, include the complete subjugation of Ukraine—which he has said does not exist as a real country with a real culture or history and which he also claims is ruled by a “neo-Nazi regime” hell-bent on conquering Russia.

As long as that is the case, drawn-out detailed discussions about the borderline between Russia and Ukraine, the shape of a demilitarized zone in the Donbas province, and the precise configuration of security arrangements for Kyiv are all colossal wastes of time.

This is not a controversial point. Reuters reported on Monday that a recent U.S. intelligence analysis concluded that Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and of reclaiming parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire. The story was credited to six sources who are familiar with the analysis.

Yet it seems that the American president, the main audience for intelligence analyses, either didn’t see this report or waved away its conclusion.

Perhaps Witkoff—who headed the U.S. delegation at the talks in Florida, along with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House staffer Josh Gruenbaum—really does believe, as he posted on social media, that “Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine.” The problem here may be that Witkoff—a real-estate magnate with no experience in diplomacy and no prior knowledge of Russian affairs—thinks “peace” means nothing more than a ceasefire and the signing of a document.

In that sense, he isn’t so different from his longtime friend and fellow real-estate tycoon who currently resides in the White House. In October, Trump played a key role in pressuring Israel and Hamas to sign a ceasefire in Gaza and a hostage-for-prisoners exchange—a notable achievement. But this marked only the first phase—covering just the initial planks—of a 20-point peace plan. The next phase requires outside countries to station security forces inside Gaza, to maintain order and set the foundations for a new political authority. So far, none of the countries in the region have volunteered for the job. Trump proudly announced, at the signing ceremony for the first phase, that he would be chairman of a “board of peace” to supervise the subsequent phases—but he has done nothing to prod anyone into action. It seems that, in his mind, he got the ball rolling; if it stops rolling, if the fighting resumes (as it has to some extent already), then that’s not his fault.

Like Witkoff, he doesn’t seem to understand that making peace, actively enforcing a ceasefire or molding the foundations to sustain one, is not a one-off gesture. It requires persistent involvement, coupled with a thorough schooling in the causes of the war and the necessary preconditions for real peace.

Trump and Witkoff not only lack that specialized schooling but think they don’t need it. They view themselves as “dealmakers” and see no distinction between brokering a deal with the New York City Department of Buildings, some vendor on a construction project, or the Kremlin.

The significant thing here is that Putin recognized, and figured out how to exploit, this skewed outlook for his own benefit. In the early days of Trump’s second term, according to a remarkable story in Friday’s Wall Street Journal, Putin asked Trump to send Witkoff to Moscow for talks on Ukraine, offering to release an American prisoner if he did so, but only on the condition that Witkoff come alone, bringing no aides or CIA analysts with him.

Trump had chosen Witkoff to be his emissary on the Middle East, so the request must have come as a surprise. In the course of a rambling hourlong address to the Israeli Knesset in October, Trump said he thought Witkoff would have a “15-or-20-minute meeting” with Putin, adding, “Steve had no idea about Russia, had no idea about Putin too much, didn’t know too much about politics, wasn’t too interested.”

As we now know, this is what made Witkoff so appealing to Putin. The Russian president already had a sympathetic ear in Trump. Now he wanted to ensure that his chief American interlocutor was someone he could easily manipulate. It is no coincidence that retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s original appointee as envoy on Ukrainian matters, recently resigned; he found himself having nothing to do.

Trump ends his first year as the returning president believing, perhaps sincerely, that he is a peacemaker. But in fact two of the world’s most consequential conflicts rage on—the war in Ukraine, which he thought he could easily end, and the war in Gaza, which he thinks he has ended. And Trump doesn’t understand why.

Earlier this month, shortly after a series of Democratic wins in off-year elections, in the government shutdown, and in nosediving polls for President Donald Trump, a number of key Democrats made some unusual choices. First, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer began once again hawking the “Porch Pirates Act,” a bill that nobody seemed to have asked for and which could come back to haunt his party if passed. Then, this week, the Democratic National Committee announced it would not release its highly anticipated 2024 autopsy report.

Why, amid its first signs of life since the devastating 2024 election results, is the party seemingly determined to take multiple steps backward?

Let’s start with Gottheimer and porch pirates. Standing proud at a podium set up in his home district on Dec. 1, Gottheimer preached how private companies like Amazon, United Parcel Service, and FedEx should receive even greater protections than the federal agency the United States Postal Service. Currently, it’s a federal crime to steal mail out of any USPS post office, letter box, or mail receptacle, with violators facing a fine and prison time of no more than five years. The Porch Pirates Act would expand on this, adding Americans’ porches to the protected mail space, and it would make stealing a package from a private porch a federal crime with punishment of up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

The legislation would also give the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Justice Department, and federal task forces the authority to “fully investigate porch theft.” There are already laws on the books that cover these sorts of thefts and any potential greater conspiracies that might be involved in them. The Porch Pirates Act is not only redundant, it is excessively punitive, especially when Democrats have spent multiple general election cycles in a row battling the image among younger voters of having boosted mass incarceration during the 1990s. It seems unwise to reopen this fight.

The Porch Pirates Act was first introduced back in 2022, but has since seen basically no movement in Congress. Last year, Democrat Dean Phillips, a former representative and sponsor of the bill, went so far as to film a video where he shadowed a UPS driver who seemed amused at best to be sharing his route with a congressman. The final product looks and sounds alarmingly like a paid UPS commercial rather than a genuine explanation for why the Porch Pirates Act is necessary. Now, it seems like Gottheimer is taking a stab at attempting to push the legislation forward.

Let’s be clear, out of all the problems American consumers are currently facing, like the impending explosion of health care costs, stubbornly high inflation on everyday goods, and rising unemployment, why do some Democrats view package theft as among voters’ top concerns? (A previous version of the bill had 17 Democratic co-sponsors, though it’s unclear how many this one has.)

Besides the irrelevant nature of the Porch Pirates Act, it also stands to significantly contribute to the country’s mass incarceration problem. Penalizing thieves for stealing some Amazon packages with prison time and fines in the hundreds of thousands would drag an already overburdened criminal justice system down even further, inevitably also increasing the cost of running state and federal prisons. It’s well documented that mass incarceration leads to poor physical, psychological, and economic outcomes for people who experience imprisonment, which ends up hurting all American communities.

The USPS Office of Inspector General even published a white paper earlier this year acknowledging the pesky problem of package theft, and recommended collaborative strategies—not criminal penalties. “Offering and making use of flexible and secure delivery options, leveraging technology for enhanced tracking and theft prevention, [and] utilizing discreet packaging and package delivery placement” were among the recommended solutions.

The Porch Pirates Act also threatens to be a repeat of the infamous crime bill of the 1990s that led to a consistent rise in incarceration rates for the following decade, and which Democrats paid for dearly. The party surely does not want to be responsible for adding yet another pathway to prison.

Unfortunately, it appears Democrats are keen to end 2025 on the wrong foot. Instead of acknowledging its faults and reckoning with its consistently low approval ratings this year, the Democratic National Committee decided to continue ignoring its problems by scrapping the public release of its 2024 autopsy report. Claiming it would simply distract and divide the party, the lack of accountability now sets the stage for Democrats to repeat the same grave mistakes in the 2026 midterms and beyond. Party establishment gets to continue its iron grip, no fundamental changes will be made to Democrats’ platform, but hey, at least they can say they fought for Americans’ porches.

Ever since he returned to the White House, President Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to the federal workforce, attempting to purge tens of thousands of civil servants and shutter entire agencies. The Supreme Court has largely rubber-stamped these mass layoffs, even when they frustrated congressional commands expressly intended to direct, structure, and constrain the executive branch. Last month, however, Congress struck back in a little-noticed move that shifted power away from the Trump administration by outlawing further illegal firings and reversing those already underway. And on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston issued an injunction enforcing the new law, rejecting the government’s brazen attempt to defy it.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss the ruling and its encouraging implications for the separation of powers and a bolstered Congress subject to a president who refuses to acknowledge most limits on his authority. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Susan Illston has been battling the administration over these layoffs for months now. Why was this latest round different?

Mark Joseph Stern: Because Congress did something that was long overdue—it wrote a statute that tightly constrains the executive branch. And Illston actually enforced it as written against the Trump administration.

Recall that during the shutdown, the president moved forward with mass layoffs across a bunch of federal agencies. They were euphemistically called “reductions in force.” People lost their jobs, their paychecks, their housing, even overseas postings. It was a disaster. And Trump claimed that the shutdown gave him broader leeway to purge the civil and foreign service and also to use those layoffs to inflict pain on Democrats because they were refusing to capitulate and reopen the government.

When Congress finally did end the shutdown on Nov. 12 and reopened the government, the funding bill that it passed included a provision that directly reversed Trump’s layoffs in two ways. First, the bill declared that “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force” through late January, when funding expires again. That language clearly bars any further steps to lay off federal employees through the end of next month. Second, the bill said that any reduction in force “proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken” during the shutdown “shall have no force or effect.” That language clearly reinstates any federal employee who was either told they’d be laid off during the shutdown or actually laid off.

To no one’s surprise, the administration immediately tried to repeal that language by reinterpreting it to mean almost nothing. Russell Vought—a Project 2025 author and now the director of the Office of Management and Budget—decreed that the first provision barred the government only from sending additional RIF notices through January but would allow it to complete the many, many layoffs that had already been initiated. Vought then said that the second provision applied only if a layoff notice went out during the shutdown. He claimed that if the employee had been warned earlier in the year that they were going to be fired and the actual firing happened during the shutdown, then the layoff was still lawful. The Trump administration tried to exploit that ridiculous interpretation by rescinding layoff notices that had been sent during the shutdown and immediately reissuing them to say: You have a new notice that came after the shutdown, so we can legally fire you.

On Wednesday, Illston shut this down. First, she said that there can be no layoffs through January, period. The bill announced that no federal funds can be used to carry out or implement RIFs. That means what it says. It does not allow the administration to fire people who previously received a notice that they’d be fired. Second, the judge ordered the reinstatement of everyone who was either told they’d be fired or actually fired during the shutdown. Remember, Congress reversed any RIF that was “noticed,” “executed,” or “implemented” during the shutdown. That covers everybody who was subject to any aspect of the RIF process. So, thanks to Illston’s order, all of those people now get their jobs back. That covers hundreds of employees right now, and possibly thousands more in the coming month, given the plans that Vought was developing for another round of the purges that Congress had outlawed.

How is it that congressional Republicans allowed this language? Did it just escape their notice? Were they secretly opposed to the RIFs as well?

No—this was a bargain struck by Senate Democrats. Republicans needed their help to end the shutdown, and a group of Democrats conditioned their votes on statutory language that would halt the RIFs. All Illston is doing here is enforcing that language in the face of the Trump administration brazenly defying Congress. I know that her decision will prompt another round of allegations that Illston is a “resistance judge”—especially since she tried to halt the RIFs earlier this year and the Supreme Court reversed her on the shadow docket. But there’s a difference between what happened in July and what’s happening now: The law has changed! Democrats in Congress saw that the existing law gave too much discretion to the executive branch. And they decided that if they were going to end the shutdown, they would at least force Congress to reassert its power and end that discretion.

That was, I think, a hugely successful move, not just for the Democratic Party and the civil service, but for Congress’ standing as a coordinate branch of government. We have been waiting for this since Trump came back into the White House. Congress has ceded the field to the presidency for nearly 11 months. It has handed over all of these powers to Trump, and the Supreme Court has overturned almost any judge who tries to kind of protect Congress’ prerogatives. Here, finally, we have Congress saying, in the most explicit language possible: We have the power of the purse. The money that we are appropriating may not be used by the Trump administration to purge the civil service. That gives me the first glimmer of hope I’ve had in a very long time that Democrats will be able to use their leverage to reassert Congress’ primacy over funding, rein in some of the White House’s abuses of power, and give SCOTUS no choice but to enforce the laws that they enact against him.

In one sense, this is a preliminary injunction from a single judge in a blue state that some will write off as “Trump derangement syndrome.” But for you, this is a masterclass in what Democrats can do—from the minority—when they theoretically have no power. This is, as you say, a flex for Congress. It’s a flex for text and statutory language. It’s a flex for using negotiations to leverage congressional prerogatives that have just been ceded to the executive branch.

And let’s also take a step back: Senate Democrats shouldn’t have been in this position in the first place. Trump’s mass layoffs were illegal. Congress did not allow him to dismantle these agencies by purging their workers. The courts should have been able to stop that. But the Supreme Court consistently stepped in and reversed them on the shadow docket, seemingly on the grounds that the executive branch has a lot of discretion and the statutes don’t tell us exactly what Congress wanted.

So the problem wasn’t just Trump abusing his power. It was also SCOTUS taking advantage of ambiguous statutory language and gaps that nobody had previously thought to exploit in the law. Congressional Democrats correctly identified that as one of the foundational issues here: not just Trump’s abuses, but the way the court was able to green-light those abuses. So they wrote language that would explicitly block Trump from misusing his power and force the courts, including SCOTUS, to implement congressional prerogatives. I do think that Illston will be upheld on appeal; I’m not even sure that the administration will try to appeal this to the Supreme Court. This is cut-and-dried, because Democrats in Congress saw the gaps that needed to be plugged and plugged them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Computer History Museum software curator Al Kossow has successfully retrieved the contents of the over-half-a-century old tape found at the University of Utah last month.

UNIX V4, the first ever version of the UNIX operating system in which the kernel was written in the then-new C programming language, has been successfully recovered from a 1970s nine-track tape drive. You can download it from the Internet Archive, and run it in SimH. On Mastodon, &quot;Flexion&quot; posted a screenshot of it running under SGI IRIX.

Last month, we wrote about the remarkable discovery of a forgotten tape with a lost early version of Unix, found by Professor Robert Ricci at the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. At the time, we quoted the redoubtable Kossow, who also runs Bitsavers, as saying that it &quot;has a pretty good chance of being recoverable.&quot; Well, he was right, and at the end of last week, he did it. Ricci also shared a video clip on Mastodon.

There&#39;s a video of the recovery here. It&#39;s only slightly over five minutes long, but then, UNIX V4 wasn&#39;t very big yet: for instance, the kernel was some 27 kB of code.

The data was recovered using the readtape program by the Computer History Museum&#39;s Len Shustek. Since few of us in the microcomputer world deal with magtapes much, the Greaseweazle tool for archiving old floppy tapes might be a more familiar comparison: rather than trying to copy the bytes or sectors from media – in other words, the processed digital data – both readtape and Greaseweazle sample and record the raw magnetic flux variations. Those can then be used to reconstruct the digital data, making some error recovery possible. In this case, only two blocks wouldn&#39;t read properly and there was enough to reconstruct their contents.

So, in the recovered files on the Internet Archive, you can see there&#39;s a 1.6 gigabyte file created from a tape that only held 40 MB or so of data. You probably don&#39;t want to download that.

Fortunately, Angelo Papenhoff offers a processed version, complete with a README telling you how to run it. For further guidance, then on Reddit, drop_table_allusers suggests:

In the directory where you downloaded all the Unix v4 files, start SimH pdp-11 executable and pass the boot.ini found in the Unix v4 files as parameter. Then press &#39;k&#39;, type &#39;unix&#39;, press enter and it boots…

It&#39;s very small: it contains around 55,000 lines of code, of which about 25,000 lines are in C, with under 1,000 lines of comments. But then, the late Dennis M. Ritchie and co-creator Ken Thompson were very definitely Real Programmers, and as is recorded in ancient wisdom:

Real Programmers don&#39;t need comments – the code is obvious.

Thompson is still active, and recently did his second oral history interview with the CHM, aptly titled A Computing Legend Speaks.

We&#39;ve seen a lot of misunderstanding of this and what it represents online, so we&#39;ll try to set it in some kind of context.

The very first version of Unix, later known as the &quot;Zeroth edition&quot;, was hand-coded in assembly language by Thompson in 1969. He wrote it for a spare PDP-7 at Bell Labs, a Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputer from 1965. The PDP-7 was an 18-bit machine: it handled memory in 18-bit words. This was so long ago that things like the eight-bit byte had not yet been standardized. PDP-7 UNIX was reconstructed from printouts between 2016 and 2019.

It did well enough that a few years later, Thompson got his hands on a PDP-11. Thompson rewrote his OS for this 16-bit machine – still in assembly language – to create UNIX First Edition. At first, the machine had a single RS11 hard disk, for a grand total of half a megabyte of storage, although the rebuilt source code is from a later machine with a second hard disk.

It was followed later the same year by UNIX v2, still on a PDP-11/20. As we reported earlier this year, something like a beta version of UNIX V2 has recently been reconstructed.

UNIX V3 followed in 1972, which introduced the new feature of pipes. This was the version on which the then-new C programming language was first written.

Now, the long-lost UNIX V4 has been found and its files recovered. This was the first version where much of the kernel was rewritten in C. UNIX V4 only ran on a higher-end model of PDP-11, the PDP-11/45.

These days, the nature and evolution of UNIX in its early stages is not well understood. For instance, some things happened simply because Ken and Dennis were working on very limited hardware. At one point, they had a single DEC RK05 hard disk, which held a massive 1.5 MB. When they got access to a second hard drive, they moved all the home directories to it. These were held in /usr – it was short for &quot;users,&quot; and it contained the home directories of both ken and dmr, meaning that it also contained most of the binary files – the actual programs constituting the OS itself. This caused them a problem: how do you mount the second hard disk when the mount command itself is on that disk? The solution: a special /sbin directory on the first hard disk which contained tools needed to, among other things, access any additional hard disks.

Rob Landley wrote an excellent explanation of the history of the split on the Busybox mailing list 15 years ago: Understanding the bin, sbin, usr/bin , usr/sbin split. Landley knows his stuff: he&#39;s the author of Toybox, which is a replacement for Bruce Perens&#39;s BusyBox multi-command binary – as used in Alpine Linux.

Today, it&#39;s part of Unix lore that there&#39;s an important functional distinction between the binaries in the root directory (/bin, /sbin, /lib and so on) and those kept under the /usr tree (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib and so on). Trying to reconcile this split is a process called the usr merge, and amusingly, the latest Alpine Linux 3.23 has not yet completed it, although it was planned to.

UNIX started out as a quick hack by two geniuses in their spare time, so that they could use a spare computer – an extremely rare thing in the 1960s – to play a videogame one of them had written: SPACEWAR, a version of Computer Space, the first ever commercial video game.

The project they were working on for their day jobs, the MULTICS operating system, became unfairly famous for being huge and over complicated. In fact, it was used for years, and is missed by its former users.

Those two geniuses, Ken and Dennis, wrote something tiny and simple, and in keeping with that, they used tiny cryptic abbreviations and very short file and directory names. Their colleague, the great Brian Kernighan – the &quot;K&quot; in &quot;K&R C&quot; and &quot;AWK&quot; – even suggested the name UNICS as a joke.

The problem is that this tiny, experimental OS escaped the lab. Version 6 got out and became the basis of the famous Lions book, the source of probably the most famous code comment of all time:

(It&#39;s at line 2238 in the annotated source code, if you&#39;re curious. The comment itself inspired a book.)

Unix V7 is the one that did the real damage: it went viral and its descendants, offshoots, and rewrites were widely adopted by industry and academia.

Now, it has grown into a bloated mess millions of times bigger than the OS which inspired it. Those jokey cryptic filenames in cryptic folders are now enshrined as holy writ, and the people maintaining the systems have forgotten their origins.

Meanwhile, the original developers kept working away, improving it and refactoring it and simplifying the design, all the way up to the Tenth Edition – then, it was radically rewritten to become the network-aware Plan 9 from Bell Labs. Today, work on that continues as 9front, which we&#39;ve written about, including its place in history.

Now, though, a crucial early evolutionary step has been found, imaged, and works. It&#39;s almost as if it were a Christmas miracle! ®

            <h2>Oracle's new AI-enhanced support portal leaves users fuming</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/23/oracles_new_aienhanced_support_portal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Oracle&#39;s new AI-powered support portal is frustrating customers and support engineers who are struggling to find the basics, such as old tickets, links to database patch programs and release schedules for current databases.

The new support portal from Big Red — My Oracle Portal or MOS — which went live in early December, has been frustrating customers and support staff for the last few weeks.

Oracle has yet to respond to a request for comment.

In November, Greg Parikh, Oracle veep for information development and operations, said in a blog post that the MOS portal offers new features, including AI-powered interactions, streamlined navigation, improved search capabilities, and enhanced knowledge access.

It is perhaps remarkable that in making these improvements, Oracle seems to have made the service worse.

One support professional who spoke to The Register said users were increasingly facing a chaotic situation with MOS. &quot;Obviously, Oracle is using this new AI to cover all customer needs, which is not working that well. Support note numbers get no satisfactory results, automatic service requests can no longer be created by Oracle customers, and patches and fixes are no longer visible because the indices are deleted.&quot;

Deutsche Oracle Anwendergruppe (DOAF), the German-speaking user group for Oracle users, also noted unreliable and incomplete search, for example, the Exadata Master Note — formerly Doc-ID 888828.1 — does not appear in the search results. There has also been a loss of favorites and personalization in the switch to the new portal, the user group said.

Meanwhile, support professional has to waste their time contending with broken or internal links and limited patch search and downloads, the user group said.

Frustration also boiled over onto Reddit, as users shared their experiences with the new Oracle portal.

Users pointed out IDs had completely changed, such that searching for 888.1 — the Primary Note for Database Proactive Patch Program — or 555.1 — database 19c Recommended One-off patches returns error message KA912 as the top result. &quot;Links to other documents, which still reference the old IDs, are currently failing for me,&quot; one user said.

Others said they had to waste time recovering information which was previously in easy reach. &quot;Even finding ‘Release schedule of Current Database releases&#39; took me several logins and searches. And the resulting view is definitely worse; at least they could hide the right panel, which effectively shrinks the readable window,&quot; another said.

Eric Guyer, founding partner at Oracle and SAP advisory and consulting firm Remend, said while the old portal was basically all access, to everything, for anyone with an Oracle Customer Support Identifier (CSI), the new portal seemed to have become more minimalist, tightly controlled, and chat-bot driven.

&quot;People used to the old portal will wonder where everything went. Bug or feature I don&#39;t know yet. Might be great… or it might be another signal that Oracle&#39;s focus is elsewhere,&quot; he said.

Iain Saunderson, CTO of Spinnaker Support, which provides support for Oracle and SAP, said the introduction of the new portal was affecting customer onboarding to alternative support to Oracle. &quot;The frustration from the community around the portal launch is that Oracle hasn&#39;t consulted their users. It doesn&#39;t work. People can&#39;t get to the information they need. We&#39;ve had a few concerns from prospective customer who are concerned about their ability to do business in MOS.&quot;

Some readers may be keen to point out that the apparent degradation of its customer support using AI comes at the same time Oracle has seemingly bet the company on AI. In the autumn, Oracle announced a $300 billion cloud compute contract with OpenAI, but KeyBanc analysts warned that Big Red may need to borrow roughly $100 billion over the next four years to build the datacenters required. Concerns over debt and the cost of building AI infrastructure have meant Oracle has lost around a third of its value since it peaked in September, more than the value of the OpenAI deal. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! The bork desk has temporarily reopened during the festive period. The tech world might be having a nap on the sofa after one mince pie too many, but bork never sleeps.

Take this example of some digital signage at PizzaExpress. Spotted by an eagle-eyed Register reader at Edinburgh airport, the screen occupies the space where customers might have once found a generic bit of printed or colored plastic.

However, progress is progress, and every bit of space must now be occupied by migraine-inducing digital signage, capable of displaying whatever important messages the marketing machine thinks prospective consumers must see.

Including, in this case, the Windows desktop. Because there are few things more likely to lure a weary traveler into an emporium of pizza dough and tomato sauce than some forlorn icons and a reminder of the time when Windows Media Player ruled the roost.

It&#39;s not clear exactly what has befallen the screen. Some of the icons reference ViPlex Express, a tool for managing digital signage. However, unless the software has a bork mode, or the establishment is seeking to attract the sort of Register reader who likes to snap shots of screens in distress, the lights are on, but nobody&#39;s home.

And then there is the tempting &quot;test&quot; file. The thumbnail isn&#39;t giving away many clues about its content - we hope that whatever it contains won&#39;t put anyone off their pizza or force a sad-faced engineer to do the walk of shame to HR.

The operating system itself is probably Windows 10, judging by the icons, and will, we&#39;re sure, either have been enrolled in Microsoft&#39;s Extended Security Updates program or be a version still supported since October.

We look forward to the next menu update. Joining the classic Margherita and American Hot will be Scottish Bork, with the famous Sloppy Giuseppe replaced by Slapdash IT. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robot taxis are coming to The Register’s London home in 2026.

Chinese web giant Baidu on Monday announced that a pilot of its Apollo Go robo-ride service will take place in the UK’s capital sometime in the first half of 2026, with help from Uber.

Uber declared itself “excited to accelerate Britain&#39;s leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year.”

Lyft is also teaming with Baidu in London.

“Our hybrid network - AVs and drivers working together - will serve all of London’s travel needs,” wrote CEO David Risher. “We’re working closely with Transport for London regulators and local communities to expand the rideshare market and create more opportunities for everyone.”

Baidu pointed out that its London experiments represent another entry to a “major right-hand drive market” made possible by its operations in former British colony Hong Kong.

When Uber and other rideshare companies entered new markets during the 2010s, they often scoffed at existing regulations and just started operations before lawmakers figured out how to regulate their services. In the UK, Uber became the subject of protests by cab drivers who saw the service as stealing their livelihoods and devaluing their hard-won – and expensive – licenses.

Uber eventually won a license to operate, then lost it, twice.

This time around, the UK has rolled out the welcome mat for robot cars under 2024’s Automated Vehicles Act.

Robo-taxis have conducted millions of uneventful rides, but remain susceptible to problems.

Last weekend, blackouts in San Francisco caused traffic lights to go dark. Waymo robo-cabs stopped at intersections – seemingly waiting for lights to change – causing traffic jams as they blocked human drivers.

The Register has covered many serious accidents and crashes involving robo-cars, plus moments when clanker chauffeurs struggled to navigate local traffic.

Infosec researchers have found attackers can easily confuse the machines, which can lead to dangerous outcomes.

            <div id="article-text">La Poste, France’s postal service, is largely offline, possibly due to an unexplained incident.

At the time of writing, the organization’s website offers only a brief message that opens “Notre site est indisponible” – our site is unavailable – and adds that its teams are doing all they can to resolve the situation quickly.

On its Facebook page, La Poste published a notice that states “A major network incident is currently disrupting all of our information systems.”

The notice states that the laposte.fr site is down, as is the Digiposte secure document storage service, La Poste’s digital identity service, and the La Poste app.

The notice also warns that some post offices may experience degraded service, but that over-the-counter transactions remain possible.

La Poste also operates a bank, Banque Postale, which is experiencing trouble.

On its X account, the bank told customers “An incident is currently disrupting the accessibility of part of our information systems. All our teams are fully mobilized to restore the situation as quickly as possible.”

Basic services such as payments and SMS-based 2FA remain available, but the bank’s app and online services are down.

French outlet Le Monde Informatique reports that La Poste says it’s experienced a DDoS attack.

Cloudflare’s Radar service records some traffic spikes on Monday, the day on which La Poste’s troubles began, but The Register cannot find evidence of malicious traffic targeting France in recent hours.

It is unclear if the incident will delay deliveries in the last two days before Christmas.

Whatever’s going on, La Poste appears to be struggling to restore services as the little information it has posted is ten or twelve hours old at the time of writing.

The Register will update this story if more information becomes available. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has created a Special Task Force to investigate the failed launch of its H3 rocket on Monday.

The launch was the eighth for the H3, a medium-lift rocket that JAXA developed to replace the H-IIA launcher, which flew fifty times between 2001 and 2025 with just one mission failure.

The H3 can launch under its own power, or with assistance from two or four solid-fuel boosters. That versatility means it is suited to many missions.

The first H3 flight took place in March 2023 and failed when the rocket did not receive the command to ignite its second stage. The rocket therefore slowed and JAXA destroyed the vehicle.

The next six H3 missions all succeeded, but according to JAXA, during Monday’s launch “the second stage engine’s second ignition failed to start normally and shut down prematurely.”

The H3 now has a 25 percent failure rate, a problem for Japan and the world.

The rocket’s failure is bad news for Japan because the country’s space program is ambitious and strategic. Monday’s mission carried a single satellite named QZS-5, which was to form part of Japan’s seven-satellite navigation constellation and reduce its reliance on similar services controlled by other countries.

Japan is also a contributor to the Artemis program, the US-led effort to establish a human presence on the Moon. One part of that plan called for JAXA to use the H3 to launch a water-spotting satellite called LUPEX in 2027.

JAXA partnered with India’s Space Research Organization to work on LUPEX.

Speaking of ISRO, it’s counting down to Christmas Eve launch of its LVM3 rocket.

The payload on this mission is AST SpaceMobile’s BlueBird Block-2 satellite, a craft that will provide cellular broadband services accessible with everyday smartphones.

            <div id="article-text">The rechargeable Recon 360 Faucet addresses every minor complaint I had with its predecessor.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

As a reluctant doomsday prepper and eager vanlifer, Dometic’s battery-powered Go Faucet has, for the last few years, played a central role in my bougie bug-out kit and my camping rig’s water system. So it took me all of two minutes with Dometic’s new Recon 360 Faucet to realize it’s an upgrade in every single way that matters — and then confirmed after a week of testing it.

The Recon 360 Faucet lets you pump water out of a storage container like a typical faucet in places that lack traditional plumbing, be it inside a boat, cabin, or van, or at the beach, job site, or campground. A long silicone water hose attaches to the back of the faucet and snaps into the CPC quick-connect fitting found on Dometic’s Go Jug or Recon Hardside Coolers. But there’s nothing to stop you from dropping that tube into any jerry can via a third-party CPC adapter. It also works with inline filters like the one I use from LifeStraw and Camelbak.

As to the upgrades, the Recon 360 Faucet ditches the easy-to-miss touch surface for real mechanical buttons. One button produces a standard water flow to brush your teeth or fill a glass, and the second, larger button emits a more forceful stream for washing dishes, your hair, or quickly filling a water bottle before heading out on a hike. The water stream shuts off with a second press of the active button, otherwise it’ll automatically stop the flow after 90 seconds or 1.5L/3L to avoid depleting that precious resource.

In my testing, pressing the smaller button extracts one liter of water in 41 seconds (at a loud 52dB from arm’s length), while the fast button yields one liter in just 24 seconds at an even louder 60dB. The low-flow mode is quieter than the original one-button Go Faucet, with a less annoying drone due to its lower pitch. However, it’s still too loud for vanlifers to sneak a glass of water at night while others sleep, although the bright LED light that illuminates the stream certainly makes it possible.

And as the name suggests, the base can now be rotated 360 degrees for more placement options. It’s a welcome change that should reduce the number of times I have to clean water off my kitchen counter when the stiff, crimp-resistant water hose — included with both Dometic models — caused the lightweight Go Faucet to twist away from the sink.

Thankfully, the new tap has also been migrated from Micro USB to a USB-C connector for charging, with a battery that’s still good for about 150 liters (about 40 gallons). The Recon 360 Faucet now also has a 4-stage LED meter on top that shows the remaining charge.

The faucet is slightly smaller but a little heavier than the Go model. It comes with a selection of metal pucks that can be adhered to a countertop or water jug to create a platform for the faucet’s magnetic base. The force of the new magnet feels about twice as strong as the older model, which should hold the faucet in place better when driving down bumpy roads. That’s good because I’ve sent my Go Faucet flying through the van about five or six times now, yet it just keeps on pumping. I hope the Recon 360 Faucet is just as durable.

The only real issue is the price: $149.99 for the Recon 360 Faucet, instead of $99.99 for the Go Faucet, which Dometic still sells. The Go Faucet is great, but the Recon 360 fixes so many little complaints that I think it’s worth every extra penny. Yes, there are cheaper and less-functional alternatives to be had on Amazon and AliExpress, but if you need to use a portable faucet regularly, like I do, then Dometic’s durable and feature-rich faucets won’t disappoint if you can afford them.

﻿Imported drones, like the ones made by DJI, are said to present an ‘unacceptable risk’ without authorization from the DoD or DHS.

The Federal Communications Commission has banned new drones made in foreign countries from being imported into the US unless the Department of Defense or the Department of Homeland Security recommends them. Monday’s action added drones to the FCC’s Covered List, qualifying foreign-made drones and drone parts, like those from DJI, as communications equipment representing “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.”

DJI is “disappointed” by today’s action, Adam Welsh, DJI’s head of global policy, says in a statement. “While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.” Welsh adds that DJI “remains committed to the U.S. market” and noted that existing products can continue operation as usual. Other items on the FCC’s list include Kaspersky anti-virus software (added in 2024) and telecommunications equipment from Huawei and ZTE (added in 2021).

The FCC says it received a National Security Determination on December 21st from an interagency body saying that “uncrewed aircraft systems” (UAS) and critical UAS components produced in a foreign country could “enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over U.S. territory” and that “U.S. cybersecurity and critical‑infrastructure guidance has repeatedly highlighted how foreign‑manufactured UAS can be used to harvest sensitive data, used to enable remote unauthorized access, or disabled at will via software updates.”

If you already own a drone made outside the US, you will still be able to use it, according to the FCC’s fact sheet. Drones or drone components can be removed from the Covered List if the DoD or DHS “makes a specific determination to the FCC” that it does not pose unacceptable risks.

“Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), also known as drones, offer the potential to enhance public safety as well as cement America’s leadership in global innovation,” FCC chairman Brendan Carr says.

            <div id="article-text">The most talked-about CBS News story this year never aired on CBS

The most talked-about CBS News story this year never aired on CBS

Yesterday, Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News, censored a segment of its newsmagazine 60 Minutes about men who had been deported to an El Salvador prison. Today, it’s popping up online.

60 Minutes had already begun promoting the now-censored segment online. Because it was pulled so late, it seems that CBS missed at least one platform for distribution: Canada’s Global TV. Some people used a VPN to watch it; at least one person recorded it, distributing it through an iCloud account.

The segment, which has been reviewed by The Verge, is a little shy of 14 minutes long. It features video of men, chained and bent double, being “paraded in front of cameras, pushed onto buses, and delivered to CECOT,” according to the segment’s narration. One former detainee, who CBS met in Colombia, said he was told he was “the living dead” at CECOT. After trying to seek asylum in the US, he says he was detained by customs and held for six months before being deported. He described horrific conditions at the prison, saying he was beaten until he bled and that he was thrown into a wall so hard he broke one of his teeth. He also described sexual assault by the guards. Another interviewed former detainee described what can only be called torture: being forced to kneel for 24 hours, and being put in a dark room, where they were beaten if they moved from the stress position.

“In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

The men were among those who had been deported to El Salvador, a country they are not from. The Trump administration has sent at least 288 people, mostly Venezuelans and Salvadorans, to CECOT after the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, offered to house prisoners for a fee. Many of the people who were deported were awaiting asylum cases, according to The New York Times. It is perhaps the most horrific and breathtaking abuse of human rights from the Trump administration and a vital area for continued reporting.

The Trump administration has more deals like the one with CECOT in the pipeline, worth “millions of dollars,” according to the segment. The US may begin deporting people to places they have no relationship with, such as South Sudan and Uganda, which also have “well-documented histories of torturing prisoners.”

The story, in addition to breaking news about the deals with other countries, appears to be thoroughly reported, and both the US Department of Homeland Security and El Salvador were given opportunities to comment.

“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” wrote Sharyn Alfonsi, the reporter whose segment it was, in an email to colleagues yesterday, according to The New York Times. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

Because the order to kill the story came so late, CBS didn’t successfully replace the original program everywhere that had been set to deliver it

The story had gotten through all the usual approvals, including Weiss, who suddenly changed her mind. She demanded additional reporting, “including an on-camera interview with a member of the Trump administration,” according to The Washington Post. The story was killed on Saturday night, and the promotional material was removed on Sunday. Weiss sent an edit note saying, among other things, that the segment did not adequately explain the administration’s rationale for sending people to El Salvador.

The notes do not seem unreasonable — except in their timing, which is belated and bizarre, practically calculated to cause an uproar. And, it seems, because the order to kill the story came so late, not every distributor replaced the program.

Weiss was placed in charge of CBS News by David Ellison as part of a fairly obvious attempt to placate the Trump administration and allow his company, Skydance, to acquire CBS parent company, Paramount. President Donald Trump has repeatedly whined about CBS — and 60 Minutes’ work in particular. Just before the takeover by Skydance, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit Trump filed over the editing applied to an interview with Kamala Harris.

Ellison’s Skydance is now attempting to buy Warner Bros. in a hostile bid.

Weiss claimed on an editorial call on Monday that she “held that story because it wasn’t ready,” according to The Washington Post. The team had given the White House a chance to comment, and the Trump administration declined, according to the Post. “If the standard for airing a story becomes ‘the government must agree to be interviewed,’ then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state,” Alfonsi wrote in her email.

Anyway, best of luck to Weiss in playing DMCA whack-a-mole with the video of the story. The segment lives as online samizdat now. Thanks to Weiss’ censorship, it may very well wind up being the most-talked-about CBS News story this year.

You’ll get a personalized ‘award’ and an AI-generated image based on how you used ChatGPT this year.

ChatGPT is joining the flood of apps offering yearly recaps for users. It’s rolling out a “Year in Review” feature that will show you a bunch of stats — like how many messages you sent to the chatbot in 2025 — as well as give you an AI-generated pixel art-style image that encompasses some of the topics you talked about this year.

The image I received showed an aquarium beside a game cartridge, an Instant Pot, and a computer screen, reflecting some of the questions I had related to retro game consoles, cooking, and my fish tank setup.

There are other personalized summaries, too, like a rundown of the themes most prevalent in your chats, a description of your chat style, and which day you sent the most messages to the chatbot. You’ll also see an “archetype” that puts you into a category based on how you used the app this year, such as “The Producer” or “The Navigator,” along with a customized award, like the one I got: “Instant Pot Prodigy.”

The yearly recaps are rolling out now to users in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. It’s only available if you’ve given ChatGPT permission to reference your past conversations and personal preferences. You can find your year in review by selecting the option on the homepage of the ChatGPT app on mobile or desktop, or by prompting ChatGPT to “show my year in review.”

Zampella cofounded Respawn Entertainment and the original Call of Duty studio, Infinity Ward.

Vince Zampella, who had a major hand in developing franchises like Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, and Battlefield, died in a car crash on Sunday, NBC Los Angeles reports. He was 55.

NBC Los Angeles and CBS Los Angeles report California Highway Patrol responded to a single-car crash at around 12:45PM local time on Angeles Crest Highway in Altadena. An Emergency SOS request came in via satellite from an Apple device, according to the CHP’s incident log.

The Highway Patrol did not identify Zampella, but CHP officer Marissa Mcintire sent over a press release about the crash that says:

Preliminary investigation indicated Vehicle #1 was traveling southbound on Angeles Crest Highway, approaching MPM 62.70, within the #1 lane. For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed. The passenger was ejected from the vehicle and the driver remained trapped. Both parties succumbed to their injuries.

Zampella cofounded Respawn Entertainment, which EA acquired in 2017 and is known for series like Titanfall, Apex Legends, and Star Wars Jedi. EA put him in charge of the Battlefield series in 2021 after the rocky launch of Battlefield 2042, and the series’ latest entry, Battlefield 6, has had a strong release. Before founding Respawn, Zampella helped cocreate the Call of Duty series at Infinity Ward, where he served as studio head and CEO.

”This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,” EA spokesperson Justin Higgs says in a statement. “Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”

The Battlefield team shared this statement on X:

We are heartbroken by the loss of Vince Zampella, a creative leader whose work shaped generations of players and helped define what modern shooters and action games could be.

Across a remarkable career, Vince played a foundational role in franchises including Call of Duty, Titanfall, Apex Legends, and the Star Wars Jedi series. During his time guiding Battlefield, he led with care and purpose, always grounding decisions in what mattered most to the community and the long-term future of the franchise.

While his impact reached far beyond any one game or studio, we will remember Vince for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas, and believing in Battlefield and the people building it.

We are deeply grateful for his leadership, his generosity, and the care he brought to everything he touched, and we will carry that forward with us.

We’re heartbroken by the passing of our founder and dear friend Vince Zampella.

Vince was a titan and legend of this industry, a visionary leader and a force who shaped teams and games like Call of Duty, Titanfall, Apex Legends, the Star Wars Jedi series and Battlefield for our community in ways that will be felt for generations.

His impact reached far beyond any one game or studio. We will remember Vince for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas, and believing in Respawn & Battlefield. Most importantly, he championed what he believed was right for the people behind those studios and our players because it mattered.

Our hearts are with his family, friends, and all who love him.

As one of the founders of Infinity Ward and Call of Duty, you will always have a special place in our history.

Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable.

Our deepest condolences to Vince’s family and loved ones upon this terrible tragedy.

            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin tried to evade the Feds. Now it wants to share a beer with them.

Bitcoin tried to evade the Feds. Now it wants to share a beer with them.

Bitcoin culture, by nature, is anarchical and chaotic. It has to be, given the nature of Bitcoin itself and the people who adopted it: free-market libertarians who’ve gone all in on turning computer code into a form of money divorced from central banks, government intervention, and traceability. In short, it’s the exact opposite culture of Washington, DC, home of the federal government, where everyone agrees that the American dollar exists and is worth X amount because the government says so.

So it was a bizarre shock to K Street, the corporate lobbying heart of the nation’s capital, when it was announced that Pubkey, a Bitcoin-themed dive bar from New York City, would open its second location in downtown DC — smack dab in expense-card restaurant territory. And that’s to say nothing of the local city news sites. “Raise your hand if you plan to never set foot in there,” wrote a commenter on PoPville, a popular Washington blog that chronicles local news and had broken the news of Pubkey’s opening.

Crypto has a highly controversial reputation in town, even apart from its general cultural reputation: the Biden administration had been aggressive in trying to curb the industry’s growth, claiming that several major corporations did not have sufficient anti-money laundering protections in place. President Donald Trump’s full-bore tilt in the opposite direction — dropping the Department of Justice’s efforts to prosecute crypto crimes, pardoning several crypto executives who’d been found guilty of various financial crimes, making his own meme coin — has turned the regulation of digital tokens into a deeply partisan issue.

“Our top priority is trying to figure out how to soften that [hostility],” Thomas Pacchia, the founder of Pubkey’s New York City location, told me. To hear Pacchia put it, Pubkey DC — located strategically in the heart of DC’s lobbying neighborhood and close enough to Capitol Hill — was going to be a vessel for the Bitcoin community’s political aspirations and influence. But rather than dump money into endless lobbying against the interests of much larger crypto behemoths (and to say nothing of traditional financial institutions), Pubkey was going to do it through soft power. Instead of policy white papers and government affairs work, they were going to invite people — Republican, Democrat, important people, not-important people — into their quirky, very nice, superchill world, full of Bitcoiners who wanted to work with the government rather than evade them at all costs.

First things first: hide the wonky policy stuff behind the bar — literally.

I’d heard through the lobbyist grapevine that Pubkey would also share a lease with the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank researching the social impact of the coin. I have never seen a Washington think tank whose entrance was behind a bar. In fact, when I attended Pubkey’s VIP preview in November, I couldn’t tell that this massive bar and event space, filled with old Chesterfield sofas and layered with Armenian rugs the size of studio apartments, contained an honest-to-goodness think tank, unless you saw the glowing neon sign that said BITCOIN POLICY INSTITUTE at the very, very back of the venue.

Between me and the entrance to BPI were a hundred-plus VIP guests — elected officials, Washington power players, and staffers galore. I initially planned on taking notes of who was in attendance. I soon gave up, because there was so much other stuff to look at.

In the two hours I was at the event, I saw the following:

But the weirdest thing of all was how many people in the crowd were wearing suits.

This was exactly what Pacchia envisioned. “There are good dive bars and good hospitality in DC, for sure,” he told me later, wearing the Mario Kart bomber jacket that he’d worn in a photo with Secretary Bessent. “But the way the city operates, it’s very transient, depending on the administration: people coming and going, policymakers, staffers, the colleges and universities.” People, in other words, who could ultimately write the laws that regulate cryptocurrency like bitcoin.

The first part of that plan was to shape lawmakers’ understanding of Bitcoin, and to Pacchia, that meant bringing a curated version of Bitcoin’s oddball culture to DC: deeply nerdy protocol discussions set in a fun, affordable bar with a good burger and a secret chophouse and football and trivia and Mario Kart tournaments. But if young, broke staffers wanted to just get a post-work drink and not think about Bitcoin, other than the small sign behind the bar tracking the price of Bitcoin, that was fine too. “We wanted to cast a really wide net and just show people that the Bitcoin culture and the Bitcoin community is broadly misunderstood. We’re normal people, kind of nerdy, really into this thing. You can come here, and it’s not going to be a church.”

The advocacy part was definitely there, in the form of a giant event space behind the bar where Pubkey planned to host the evening events that make Washington run: fireside chats, summits, small conferences, and happy hours. There was even a large stage that could either be used for anything from panel discussions to live music. “DC’s more event driven,” said Pacchia, noting that the original Pubkey also hosts podcasts, panels, and get-togethers — just in a cramped Greenwich Village underground dive bar. “We wanted to combine all the different spaces that we have in New York, just with a lot more square footage to be able to host events.”

Loyal customers had been clamoring for Pubkeys in other cities, from San Francisco to Barcelona. Instead, Pubkey decided to go to a deeply partisan city where at least half of its residents loathed the concept of cryptocurrency. Sure, they had a few allies among the Democrats, such as Rep. Torres and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), but the majority of the party, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Biden, are hostile. It didn’t help that Trump had visited the New York Pubkey during his 2024 presidential campaign, paying for his smashburgers in Bitcoin, and Kamala Harris didn’t. (Pacchia says that he extended invites to both the Biden and Harris campaigns, but never heard back.) And even some Republicans remain hostile: the previous restaurant had been a popular hangout for Republican staffers and the reporters who covered them, and when it closed in April, one could hear people yelling Fuck bitcoin! from the karaoke room in the basement.

The concept of Pubkey as Bitcoin cultural diplomacy that transcended partisanship — a cryptocurrency version of Barack Obama’s beer summit — does sound overly idealistic in DC, where the current political climate has exacerbated people’s tendency to separate into Republican and Democrat bars. Liberals frequently gather to protest outside Butterworth’s, a recently opened gastropub whose investors include several high-profile MAGA influencers. A recent attempt to open a bipartisan bar, Political Pattie’s, was widely mocked by Republicans and Democrats alike — so much that it closed within 75 days.

But at its core, Pubkey DC is a pro-Bitcoin interest group that happens to be inside a bar capturing those elusive yet attainable Cozy Vibes: an affordable menu, a lot of comfy couches, and enough TVs to air as many major sporting events as possible. (They are probably going to host a Super Bowl party.) And crucially, it’s edited out all the elements of a culture that would horrify politicians — the kind that would result in, say, fraudsters pulling multibillion-dollar scams while living in a Bermuda polycule, or shady actors ordering drugs and assassinations on the Silk Road, or wealthy people being kidnapped and held hostage for their crypto. (At least downtown DC is heavily policed.)

The venue already has a few high-profile cheerleaders — including Tammy Haddad, the founder of Haddad Media, whose name is synonymous with the concept of throwing huge parties and exclusive events full of Washington’s most influential people.

When I got on the phone with Haddad, she had just come from another Pubkey event, Crypto Christmas, where three leading Senators were in attendance — Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Tim Scott — and dozens of young Capitol Hill staffers. “Who would think Crypto Christmas would be on 7th Street?” she told The Verge in an interview. “Some people might think it would be at the Willard Hotel or the Four Seasons, but no.”

Haddad, also the founder of the Washington AI Network, compared Pubkey’s ethos to net neutrality’s grassroots approach to winning political capital. “Back then it was more astroturfing and in states. But this is right in the downtown community, not [just with] lobbyists, but everyone else that they can bring into the party. It’s an interesting idea. I would argue it’s a new kind of coalition building.”

As she viewed it, Bitcoin and crypto was now in the next stage of its yearslong plan to gain legitimacy: now that they had a handful of strong political allies in the states and inside Washington, they needed to play the long game by opening the discussion about Bitcoin’s future to anyone and everyone who could not score an invite to an exclusive event for policymakers at the Four Seasons. And, more importantly, they needed to show the political world that Bitcoin was not a coin solely defined by its extremely dark and checkered past.

“It’s not like Pubkey is just trying to sell drinks,” she said.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130393/how-social-media-encourages-the-worst-of-ai-boosterism/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”

Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics. “Science acceleration via AI has officially begun,” Bubeck crowed.

Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.

Bubeck was excited that GPT-5 seemed to have somehow solved a number of puzzles known as Erdős problems.

Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, left behind hundreds of puzzles when he died. To help keep track of which ones have been solved, Thomas Bloom, a mathematician at the University of Manchester, UK, set up erdosproblems.com, which lists more than 1,100 problems and notes that around 430 of them come with solutions.

When Bubeck celebrated GPT-5’s breakthrough, Bloom was quick to call him out. “This is a dramatic misrepresentation,” he wrote on X. Bloom explained that a problem isn’t necessarily unsolved if this website does not list a solution. That simply means Bloom wasn’t aware of one. There are millions of mathematics papers out there, and nobody has read all of them. But GPT-5 probably has.

It turned out that instead of coming up with new solutions to 10 unsolved problems, GPT-5 had scoured the internet for 10 existing solutions that Bloom hadn’t seen before. Oops!

There are two takeaways here. One is that breathless claims about big breakthroughs shouldn’t be made via social media: Less knee jerk and more gut check.

The second is that GPT-5’s ability to find references to previous work that Bloom wasn’t aware of is also amazing. The hype overshadowed something that should have been pretty cool in itself.

Mathematicians are very interested in using LLMs to trawl through vast numbers of existing results, François Charton, a research scientist who studies the application of LLMs to mathematics at the AI startup Axiom Math, told me when I talked to him about this Erdős gotcha.

But literature search is dull compared with genuine discovery, especially to AI’s fervent boosters on social media. Bubeck’s blunder isn’t the only example.

In August, a pair of mathematicians showed that no LLM at the time was able to solve a math puzzle known as Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem. Two months later, social media erupted with evidence that GPT-5 now could. “Lee Sedol moment is coming for many,” one observer commented, referring to the Go master who lost to DeepMind’s AI AlphaGo in 2016.

But Charton pointed out that solving Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem isn’t a big deal to mathematicians. “It’s a question you would give an undergrad,” he said. “There is this tendency to overdo everything.”

Meanwhile, more sober assessments of what LLMs may or may not be good at are coming in. At the same time that mathematicians were fighting on the internet about GPT-5, two new studies came out that looked in depth at the use of LLMs in medicine and law (two fields that model makers have claimed their tech excels at).

Researchers found that LLMs could make certain medical diagnoses, but they were flawed at recommending treatments. When it comes to law, researchers found that LLMs often give inconsistent and incorrect advice. “Evidence thus far spectacularly fails to meet the burden of proof,” the authors concluded.

But that’s not the kind of message that goes down well on X. “You’ve got that excitement because everybody is communicating like crazy—nobody wants to be left behind,” Charton said. X is where a lot of AI news drops first, it’s where new results are trumpeted, and it’s where key players like Sam Altman, Yann LeCun, and Gary Marcus slug it out in public. It’s hard to keep up—and harder to look away.

Bubeck’s post was only embarrassing because his mistake was caught. Not all errors are. Unless something changes researchers, investors, and non-specific boosters will keep teeing each other up. “Some of them are scientists, many are not, but they are all nerds,” Charton told me. “Huge claims work very well on these networks.”

There’s a coda! I wrote everything you’ve just read above for the Algorithm column in the January/February 2026 issue of MIT Technology Review magazine (out very soon). Two days after that went to press, Axiom told me its own math model, AxiomProver, had solved two open Erdős problems (#124 and #481, for the math fans in the room). That’s impressive stuff for a small startup founded just a few months ago. Yup—AI moves fast!

But that’s not all. Five days later the company announced that AxiomProver had solved nine out of 12 problems in this year’s Putnam competition, a college-level math challenge that some people consider harder than the better-known International Math Olympiad (which LLMs from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI aced a few months back).

The Putnam result was lauded on X by big names in the field, including Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Wolf, cofounder at the AI firm Hugging Face. Once again familiar debates played out in the replies. A few researchers pointed out that while the International Math Olympiad demands more creative problem-solving, the Putnam competition tests math knowledge—which makes it notoriously hard for undergrads, but easier, in theory, for LLMs that have ingested the internet.

How should we judge Axiom’s achievements? Not on social media, at least. And the eye-catching competition wins are just a starting point. Determining just how good LLMs are at math will require a deeper dive into exactly what these models are doing when they solve hard (read: hard for humans) math problems.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale.

This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI’s Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google’s Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen.

If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable.

To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there’s a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity—one we’re watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part.

“AI slop” can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what’s really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It’s much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.

Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway’s latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue.

These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema—tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a “world simulator” while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows.

All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they’re being used is more modest, weirder—and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands.

Anyone can and does use these tools: a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users—people who aren’t “creators” so much as just people with phones.

That’s how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera—videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn’t start with AI—TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats—it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don’t need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share.

Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta’s Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips.

Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there’s “nazislop,” the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens’ For You pages.

But the prevalence of bad actors hasn’t stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that “passes as real” toward embracing AI’s inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what “AI slop” is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.

Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, “There is definitely a competition of ‘How weird we can push this?’ among AI video creators.”

It’s the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art—especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability.

Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. “I fell right into it,” he says. “I’ve always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.”

Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned “Cooking up some fresh AI slop,” shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.

AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. “I would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,” he says.

Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There’s obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo’s project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in.

His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream.

One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the “auntie culture” in Singapore, where she’s from.

“The word ‘aunties’ often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,” she says. “I want to create a world where it’s different for them.”

Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.

There’s also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny’s face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.

These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels.

In the same vein, it’s now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider  “Italian brainrot,” which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human–animal–object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like “Bombardiro Crocodilo” and “Tralalero Tralala.” According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe.

“Italian brainrot was great when it first hit,” says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. “It was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator—they were made by the chronically online users.”

This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools—like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative.

Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as “cat dancing in a park.” The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.

OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background.

The current use of the word “slop” online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it’s now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports.

But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: “slop” has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary’s new sense of “slop” will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators.

Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. “I see this series as an experimental sketchbook,” he says. “I am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.” Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is “art.”

Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. “The AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there’s not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,” he says. “But you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.”

That’s largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices.

Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. “There’s just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond ‘Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,’” he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: “There&#39;s a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There&#39;s a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there&#39;s a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.”

And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We’ve been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it’s not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn’t exactly choose.

But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as “grifting” and “garbage.” The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings.

“The phrase ‘AI slop’ implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people—understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn&#39;t incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,” says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA.

At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there’s a kind of shame involved—one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content.

Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as “serious” or “relevant” art.

For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: “Every big advance in technology yields the question ‘What is the role of the artist?’” she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create.

Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. “It is a skill to be learned and mastered,” she says.

There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before.

It’s not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. “It’s very easy to copy the style,” Lim says. “It’s very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don’t understand why I’m doing it … Even when people try to imitate that, they don’t have that consistency.”

“It’s the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,” says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they’ve traditionally enjoyed.

For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It’s only possible because it’s been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average—arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the “formulaic derivativeness” that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting.

But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it’s bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn’t mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can’t really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn’t mean giving up. It’s more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn’t about control anyway. It’s closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone.

Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What’s new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It’s unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal—so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre—that it loops back around and becomes compelling.

To “love AI slop” is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning.

Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, “Do you know you are AI generated?”—parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors’ responses seem so AI, but of course they’re not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong.

Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it’s all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO2—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO2 out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO2 is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO2 release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO2 is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO2 this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.

The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won’t reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Unlimited Bio’s muscle growth therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna’s CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I’m just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.

Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body’s cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.

But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.

Unlimited Bio’s Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle’s story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he’s committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.

“A company like ours couldn’t exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio’s chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.

There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient’s DNA, and therefore it won’t be inherited by future generations.

The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it’s a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”

Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the VEGF therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.

He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn’t “done deep fact-checking on that.”

VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn’t know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived.

And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there’s a reason it hasn’t been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won’t tackle aging.  “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.

Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We’re convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.

There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin’s effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio’s VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.

It’s debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it’ll be more impactful on your life.”

But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical’ barriers around ‘healthy’ human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.

Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he’s “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna’s CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment.

Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”

“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.

The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.

An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.

Ylä-Herttuala isn’t optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.

And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren’t perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones.

That doesn’t mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to deal with their aging batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
