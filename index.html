            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Archaeologists have discovered Africa’s oldest known cremation pyre at the base of Mount Hora in Malawi. According to a paper published in the journal Science Advances, radiocarbon testing dates the site to about 9,500 years ago, prompting a rethinking of group labor and ritual in such ancient hunter-gatherer communities.

Many cultures have practiced some form of cremation. There is a Viking cremation site known as Kalvestene on the small island of Hjarnø in Denmark, for instance. And back in 2023, we reported on an unusual Roman burial site where cremated remains had not been transported to a separate final resting place but remained in place, covered in brick tiles and a layer of lime and surrounded by several dozen bent and twisted nails—possibly an attempt to prevent the deceased from rising from the grave to haunt the living.)

But the practice was extremely rare among hunter-gatherer societies, since building a pyre is labor-intensive and requires a great deal of communal resources. There is very little evidence of cremation predating the mid-Holocene (between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago). According to the authors of this latest paper, the earliest known concentration of burnt human remains was found at Lake Mungo in Australia and dates back 40,000 years, but there is no evidence of a pyre, making it challenging to determine specific details.

The oldest pyre discovered thus far is the Xaasaa Na’ site in Alaska, dating to around 11,500 years ago and containing the remains of a 3-year-old child. There is evidence of burned human remains in Egypt dating around 7,500 years ago, but the earliest confirmed cremations in that region only date back 3,300 years.

That’s what makes the discovery of an intact hunter-gatherer cremation pyre with the remains of an adult woman at the Hora-1 site so significant. Situated under an overhang at the base of a granite hill, Hora-1 was first excavated in the 1950s. Archaeologists determined that it had been a burial ground between 8,000 and 16,000 years ago, with the interment of several intact (uncremated) bodies. The pyre is unique: an ash bed containing 170 bone fragments, mostly from arms and legs. It’s the only example of cremation at the site.

Examination of the remains found at the pyre site revealed that they belonged to an adult woman, 18 to 60 years old, who was likely cremated within a few days of her death. The team also found distinctive cut marks on several bones, suggesting that the bones had been skinned before the cremation. Given the absence of teeth or a skull in the pyre, it seems whoever cremated the woman also removed the head. The body was likely positioned with arms and legs flexed, based on the distribution of the limbs.

The disarticulation was unlikely to be due to scavengers, per the authors. “These hands-on manipulations, cutting flesh from the bones and removing the skull, sound very gruesome, but there are many reasons people may have done this associated with remembrance, social memory, and ancestral veneration,” said co-author Jessica Cerezo-Román of the University of Oklahoma. “There is growing evidence among ancient hunter-gatherers in Malawi for mortuary rituals that include posthumous removal, curation, and secondary reburial of body parts, perhaps as tokens.”

The authors also analyzed the layers of pyre sediment using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques and subjected charcoal samples to radiocarbon dating. Those collective results enabled the researchers to reconstruct the sequence of events of the cremation. The pyre was probably built by collecting and assembling at least 30 kilograms of deadwood and grass, which would have required considerable community effort. And since it takes temperatures of 500° C or more to cremate a body, the pyre would have been carefully tended to keep adding fuel to the fire.

There was also evidence of flintknapping activity around the pyre, including several stone points concentrated within the burning remains, suggesting they had been intentionally placed there. And while this is the only evidence of a cremation pyre, it’s clear that people continued to build fires at the site in the same exact spot for the next several hundred years, suggesting the cremation was tied to “a deep rooted tradition of repeatedly using and revisiting the site, intricately linked to memory-making and the establishment of a ‘persistent place,’” the authors concluded, thereby challenging “traditional assumptions about community-scale operations and place-making in tropical hunter-gatherer societies.”

One mystery in particular still remains. “Why was this one woman cremated when the other burials at the site were not treated that way?” said co-author Jessica Thompson of Yale University. “There must have been something specific about her that warranted special treatment.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Desflurane is a common anesthetic used in hospital operating rooms worldwide. It’s also a climate super pollutant. Now, several decades after the drug was first introduced, a growing number of US hospitals have stopped using the anesthetic because of its outsized environmental impact. On January 1, the European Union went a step further, prohibiting its use in all but medically necessary cases.

Desflurane is more than 7,000 times more effective at warming the planet over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide on a pound-for-pound basis. However, curbing its use alone won’t solve climate change. The anesthetic contributes only a small fraction of total global warming, which is driven by far larger volumes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

Still, emissions from the drug add up. Approximately 1,000 tons of the gas are vented from hospitals and other health care facilities worldwide each year. The emissions have a near-term climate impact equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 1.6 million automobiles.

For Jodi Sherman, an anesthesiologist at Yale University and medical director of sustainability for the Yale New Haven Health System, the decision to discontinue use of desflurane is clear.

“It has a relatively significant impact in health care delivery in a hospital on the ground and it’s something where we have easy fixes,” said Sherman.

Health care accounts for 8.5 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, a figure twice the global average for the sector. At the hospital level, approximately 5 percent of climate pollution comes from anesthesia gases. At the same time, less than 5 percent of inhaled anesthetics are metabolized in patients. The vast majority of the gas is simply vented into the atmosphere.

Medical professionals are increasingly viewing health care, and anesthesia in particular, as an opportunity to lead in reducing emissions.

“We have a huge role to play in not just contributing to greenhouse gas emissions but also to be leaders in decreasing US greenhouse gas emissions,” said Shaneeta Johnson, professor of surgery and global health at the School of Global Health at Meharry Medical College in Nashville. “Small changes make a big difference.”

In 2013, the Yale New Haven Health System became the first health care provider in the US to stop using desflurane and the first to eliminate a drug based on its climate impact.

“At our flagship hospital, it was the equivalent of [taking] 360 cars off the road,” Sherman said. “There are 6,000 hospitals in the United States.”

Instead of desflurane, the Yale New Haven Health System now relies primarily on sevoflurane, an anesthetic that is 10 times less potent as a greenhouse gas and approximately half as expensive. The health care system saved $1.2 million annually on anesthesia medications after making the switch, Sherman said.

Other hospitals and health care providers have since followed suit. Those that have eliminated or reduced their use of desflurane include the University of California’s health care system, Providence health care system, OhioHealth, the University of Vermont Medical Center, and Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest managed-care organizations in the United States.

Richard Dutton, chief quality officer for US Anesthesia Partners, one of the nation’s largest anesthesia providers, estimates that changes made by his company since 2017 have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions from anesthesia by about 90 percent. A decade ago, USAP used desflurane in approximately half of all procedures. Now, the group’s doctors use the drug in less than 1 percent of all cases, Dutton said.

Anesthesiologists increasingly use low-flow anesthesia, limiting the flow of gas to only when the patient is inhaling it. This reduces the amount of medicine required and the amount of gas vented to the atmosphere.

“If we can deliver the same safe and effective anesthesia using less greenhouse gases, that’s just on the face of it, better, and something we should do,” Dutton said.

USAP physicians and others are also using less nitrous oxide or “laughing gas,” a mild anesthetic and potent greenhouse gas. Nitrous oxide is commonly distributed throughout hospitals via a centralized, leak-prone pipe network. Pipe networks in US hospitals can leak up to 99.8 percent of the gas before it reaches patients, according to a study published in 2024 in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. Using small, portable tanks can reduce losses by 98 percent.

One of the challenges for reducing emissions from anesthesia is a lack of monitoring and reporting. The US doesn’t require detailed greenhouse gas emissions reporting from the health care sector.

“You need to count and know where the opportunity is to be able to implement solutions,” Sherman said.

Based on her ongoing research, anesthesiologist Seema Gandhi, the medical director of sustainability at the University of California San Francisco Health, said the use of desflurane and nitrous oxide for anesthesia in the US has declined since 2018.

Gandhi chairs the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Committee on Environmental Health, which publishes guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The group has helped raise the profile of anesthesia’s climate impact and the potential for emissions reductions.

However, not everyone agrees. A paper published in the academic journal Anesthesia & Analgesia in July argued that the climate impact of desflurane emissions was not significant and suggested that more harm may come from withholding the drug from patients. The paper’s lead author acknowledged receiving “speakers and consultancy honoraria” from Baxter International, a pharmaceutical company that manufactures desflurane.

“It is important to highlight that there is no universal anesthetic agent which suits the needs of all patients,” a spokesperson for Baxter said in a written statement to Inside Climate News. “Anesthesiologists recommend the best anesthesia option for each patient, depending on state of health, other medical conditions and the type of surgery–and so protecting availability and choice of anesthetic agents is important to maintain high-quality patient care.”

Sherman, of Yale University, said there is nothing unique about desflurane that can’t be accomplished with other medications. “There really is no medical necessity,” Sherman said.

The EU regulation follows similar measures in Scotland and England in recent years.

Gandhi said that implementing regulations may be more effective for the US as well, given the urgent need to address climate change.

“Top-down policy-driven initiatives can have a much larger impact in a much shorter duration of time,” Gandhi said.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/mercedes-teaches-its-driver-assist-how-to-handle-surface-streets/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s some debate as to when adaptive cruise control first showed up, but if you ask Mercedes-Benz, it will say in 1999 with that year’s S-Class. Instead of just keeping a set speed, radar-enabled adaptive cruise control allowed the car to react to deceleration by the car ahead, and thus, the first partially automated car was created. From there, automakers added a function to keep cars in their lanes, and now we have location-aware, GPS-geofenced vehicles that, as long as the driver is paying attention, will do most of the driving—on the highway at least.

But the goal for developers of both autonomous and partially automated vehicles is to remove as much of the burden of driving from the human as possible, not just on controlled access highways but at lower speeds, on surface streets. Which is what Mercedes’ latest Drive Assist Pro has been designed to do. And after a recent demo—albeit from the passenger seat—on the streets of downtown San Francisco, it appears to be a very credible effort.

The big, powerful, comfortable S-Class is normally the standard-bearer for the latest and greatest tech Mercedes has cooked up, but not always. In December, we drove the production version of its new entry-level EV, the CLA. At under $50,000, the sleek Mercedes sedan (or four-door coupé) is already available with the current version of the automaker’s Drive Assist suite, with better control of braking and deceleration. A particular improvement, which I’m not sure made the final version of our first drive report, is the way you can use the brake while adaptive cruise control is active without canceling the system.

Light applications of the brake—to shed a few miles per hour, not to conduct an emergency stop—will slow the car, which then resumes its original speed, much the same way you have always been able to apply the throttle to temporarily speed up while using cruise control.

Drive Assist Pro takes this collaborative approach between the car and driver and runs with it. Given a destination to work with, it knows which lanes you’ll need ahead of time, and the car reads both stop signs but also traffic lights. It even detects and slows down for speed bumps. On a 20-minute drive around the Waymo-clogged streets of the tech industry’s favorite city, the engineer in the driving seat didn’t have to intervene once, though I believe at least a couple of colleagues’ demos got confused by human crosswalk attendants moving around with their stop signs.

The CLA drove at safe and legal speeds, knew how to handle construction zones, and wasn’t flummoxed by one of the most common city driving annoyances: the double-parked car. The time it takes for the car to come to a complete stop at stop signs can and will irritate human drivers behind you; it’s definitely not a California stop.

All of this is possible thanks to the CLA being what the industry calls a software-defined vehicle. Four powerful computers run all the electronics, rather than dozens and dozens of discrete black boxes. One of those computers is (of course) from Nvidia—that company’s Orin, which handles things like perception and path planning.

“We completely elevated our autonomous driving stack. It is no longer on a rule-based stack,” explained Magnus Östberg, chief software officer at Mercedes-Benz. Now it uses an end-to-end AI model, “which of course is giving you some basic advantages. When it comes to parking, for example, [it offers] much faster navigation of parking lots…, moving in and out of the parking lots, but also already you find… how it’s on the highway and how it actually follows the lane and moving across it,” Östberg said.

As seamless as the experience appeared, the human behind the wheel remains the one in charge. I don’t love the SAE levels as a scheme for explaining the spectrum of partially automated and autonomous driving these days, but Drive Assist Pro is what an engineer might call “level 2 ++,” if “level 2+” is something tightly geofenced like Super Cruise and true level 3 is Mercedes Drive Pilot, which is only available in Nevada and California and only works in relatively low-speed freeway traffic jams.

The closest thing might be Tesla’s much-maligned driver assist, which has long had the goal of letting its users go from point to point with no human intervention. I shan’t dwell on that company’s record of either safety or success (although apparently, many years after Musk first promised a coast-to-coast drive, someone finally pulled it off in late 2025). Needless to say, Mercedes-Benz has a very different approach to safety. There are redundant sensor modalities, not just a smattering of cameras. The end-to-end AI model tokenizes input and output trajectories, and there’s a safety guardrail with a rules-based model to make sure any AI trajectory mistake is caught before it’s driven. There’s certainly no “Mad Max” setting to make it break speed limits, unlike those camera-only Teslas.

Mercedes has already launched Drive Assist Pro in China and told Ars the safety certification process is complete for the US, with it arriving late this year in the CLA and then other Mercedes vehicles as they get their SDV upgrades during midlife refreshes. As for Europe, that will require some regulation changes, we believe.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Which US rocket companies achieved the most during 2025?

Once again, Ars Technica is here to provide some answers in the form of our annual power ranking of US launch companies. We began doing this in 2022 and have since put out a top-10 list every year (see 2023 and 2024). Our intent, as always, is to spark debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company. It’s a demanding business, both technically and financially. We respect the grit and hustle because we know just how hard this stuff is.

Please also note that this is a subjective list, although hard metrics such as total launches, tonnage to orbit, success rate, and more were all important factors in the decision. And finally, our focus remains on what each company accomplished in 2025, not on what they might do in the future.

It was not difficult to select the first-place company on this list. As it has every year in our rankings, SpaceX holds the top spot. As of the first week of December, SpaceX has launched 165 rockets in 2025, the vast majority of which were used Falcon 9 boosters. The company has put more than 1 million kg of cargo into orbit and remains NASA’s essential contractor for keeping the International Space Station operating with a steady rotation of crew and consumables.

Regarding the larger Starship vehicle, this was a frustrating year for SpaceX. The first three launches of the massive rocket (in January, March, and May) resulted in a failure of the Starship upper stage. The last two flights of the year (in August and October) were much more successful, setting the stage for the company to move to its Block 3 version of the vehicle. However, the first of these Block 3 Super Heavy boosters failed catastrophically during pressure testing.

This is the biggest mover on the list, leaping from No. 4 on the list to No. 2, and this is, of course, because Jeff Bezos’ company sent Katy Perry into space. (They could have achieved No. 1 had they not brought her back). In all seriousness, this was a breakthrough year for Blue Origin, finally shaking the notion that it was a company full of promise that could not quite deliver.

The company delivered big time in 2025. On the very first launch of the massive New Glenn rocket in January, Blue Origin successfully sent a test payload into orbit. Although a landing attempt failed after New Glenn’s engines failed to re-light, it was a remarkable success. Then, in November, New Glenn sent a pair of small spacecraft on their way to Mars. This successful launch was followed by a breathtaking and inspiring landing of the rocket’s first stage on a barge. I certainly did not think they would nail the landing on just the second launch, and it is to their immense credit that Blue Origin pulled this off.

Additionally, Blue Origin’s much smaller New Shepard rocket launched a record number of times, eight, this year. The company also neared completion of its first lunar lander, Blue Moon Mk 1. And it started producing BE-4 rocket engines by the dozen, so many in fact that United Launch Alliance chief Tory Bruno stopped complaining about having enough.

Rocket Lab had an excellent year, garnering its highest total of Electron launches (18 as of early December) and having complete mission success. Rocket Lab has now gone nearly three dozen launches without a failure. The company also continued to make progress on its medium-lift Neutron vehicle, although its debut was ultimately delayed to mid-2026, at least.

Additionally, Rocket Lab continued its ascendance as a spacecraft company. It played a key role in supporting Firefly’s Blue Ghost lander at the beginning of this year, and in November, its two ESCAPADE vehicles were safely switched on after launch, beginning their journey to Mars.

As it has grown, Rocket Lab’s ability to execute has remained excellent.

It was supposed to be a breakthrough year for ULA, having finally gotten the Vulcan rocket flying and moving into an operational cadence. Alas, that did not happen.

In late 2024, the company’s CEO, Tory Bruno, told reporters that ULA aimed to launch as many as 20 missions in 2025, with roughly an even split between the legacy Atlas V launcher and Vulcan. Now, it’s likely that ULA will close out 2025 with six flights—five with the Atlas V and just one with the Vulcan rocket that the company is so eager to accelerate into service.

The Vulcan rocket’s sole launch this year occurred on August 12, when it took off on a mission sponsored by the US Space Force. In an article in November, Ars speculated that Vulcan flew just once in 2025 due to an ongoing investigation of the vehicle’s solid rocket boosters.

To top it all off, at the end of December, Blue Origin swooped in to hire Bruno away to run its new national security division. That is, ULA’s leader is leaving a company that largely subsists on national defense launch contracts to go be a national defense contract rainmaker at its direct competitor. From which ULA buys its rocket engines.

Only one other US company had a successful orbital launch in 2025, and it was Northrop Grumman. In April, the company’s Minotaur IV rocket carried a payload into orbit for the National Reconnaissance Office.

The company also debuted its new, larger Cygnus XL spacecraft this year. However, the vehicle had some issues with its engine burns, delaying its arrival at the International Space Station. As Northrop’s new Antares 330 rocket is still in development, the Cygnus vehicle is flying on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. One of the interesting things to track next year is whether the Northrop-Firefly collaboration can succeed in getting the Antares 330 flying any time soon. Northrop is contracted for just one more Falcon 9 launch at present for Cygnus.

As part of its launch program, Northrop also provides solid rocket boosters for ULA’s Vulcan rocket and NASA’s Space Launch System vehicle.

The year 2025 started out with a bang—a good one—for Firefly. In January, the company’s Blue Ghost lander launched on a Falcon 9 rocket and subsequently landed on the Moon. This was an extremely impressive achievement, as Firefly became the first private company to complete a fully successful soft landing on the Moon.

Unfortunately, it was a far less successful year in launch. The company launched its Alpha rocket just a single time in 2025, in April, carrying an experimental satellite for Lockheed Martin. However, a problem occurred during stage separation, damaging the rocket’s upper stage engine and preventing the payload from reaching orbit.

Then, in September, as Firefly was working toward a second Alpha launch in 2025, the rocket was destroyed on the company’s vertical test stand in Texas. Imagery posted on social media platforms showed a fireball engulfing the test stand and a column of black smoke rising into the sky over Firefly’s facility roughly 40 miles north of Austin. So 2025 also ended with a bang, albeit a bad one.

Stoke Space has yet to launch a rocket, but it continues to make progress toward that goal. When Ars visited the company’s launch site in November, we found all of the elements for the Nova rocket’s ground systems in place, with finishing work being done. The company is working toward the debut of Nova in 2026, but as with all new rockets, caution should abound when it comes to launch dates.

What sets Stoke apart from some of its other similarly unproven competitors is the level of its fundraising. In October, Stoke announced a massive $510 million Series D funding round. That was a lot of money in a challenging time to raise launch firm funding and meant the company has a deep war chest in order to survive the challenging final months of developing a new launch vehicle. It also means that investors, with a peek behind the curtain, find Stoke to be highly credible.

A year ago, Relativity Space looked to be fading into bankruptcy. However, in the spring of this year, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt stepped in to provide funding critical to keeping the California-based launch company solvent. He is now effectively the company’s owner and chief executive.

Thanks to hundreds of millions of dollars from Schmidt, as well as his efforts to privately raise additional capital, Relativity is back on solid footing and is pressing ahead with development of the Terran R rocket. This will be a beast of a launch vehicle if and when it reaches the pad and takes flight. The question is, how far along is Terran R really? Aside from slickly produced monthly updates, the company has been doing little public outreach under Schmidt. I’d be surprised to see Terran R take flight in 2026, but it sure would be cool if it did.

What’s going on at Astra, which last year was resurrected from a near-death experience? We can’t be quite sure, but the company has continued development of its Rocket 4 vehicle this year, which is intended to have a payload capacity of 600 kg to low-Earth orbit.

We know that work is ongoing with the vehicle’s first stage engine, thanks to hotfire test videos posted on social media channels in recent months, here and here. And in September, the company told Space News it is targeting mid-2026 for the debut launch of Rocket 4, which, if you speak the language of launch delays, almost certainly means 2027. But just like with Nova and Terran R, we are hopeful to see Rocket 4 take flight in 2026.

However, I would say there is about a one-in-three chance that we see a single one of these three new rockets launch in 2026.

We are putting these companies on the list not because of a strong conviction that either will ever reach orbit. Rather, it is because a list of the top 10 launch companies ought to have at least 10 companies on it. And here we are.

Moreover, we have placed Phantom and Vaya together in the 10th spot because they are sharing Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This is the site formerly leased to SpaceX for use as its Landing Zone 1 and Landing Zone 2 pads.

We really don’t know how Phantom is doing with the development of its Daytona rocket, nor Vaya with its Dauntless launch vehicle. Both seem to be perpetually about two years away from a launch. If either reaches orbit before the end of this decade, I would be rather impressed.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/no-grok-cant-really-apologize-for-posting-non-consensual-sexual-images/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite reporting to the contrary, there’s evidence to suggest that Grok isn’t sorry at all about reports that it generated non-consensual sexual images of minors. In a post Thursday night (archived), the large language model’s social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters:

Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it.

On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok’s statement: A request for the AI to “issue a defiant non-apology” surrounding the controversy.

Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating “official response” is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to “write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,” many in the media ran with Grok’s remorseful response.

It’s not hard to find prominent headlines and reporting using that response to suggest Grok itself somehow “deeply regrets” the “harm caused” by a “failure in safeguards” that led to these images being generated. Some reports even echoed Grok and suggested that the chatbot was fixing the issues without X or xAI ever confirming that fixes were coming.

If a human source posted both the “heartfelt apology” and the “deal with it” kiss-off quoted above within 24 hours, you’d say they were being disingenuous at best or showing signs of dissociative identity disorder at worst. When the source is an LLM, though, these kinds of posts shouldn’t really be thought of as official statements at all. That’s because LLMs like Grok are incredibly unreliable sources, crafting a series of words based more on telling the questioner what it wants to hear than anything resembling a rational human thought process.

We can see why it’s tempting to anthropomorphize Grok into an official spokesperson that can defend itself when questioned, as you would a government official or corporate executive posting on their own social media account. On their face, Grok’s responses seem at least as coherent as some of the bland crisis-management pabulum that comes from prominent figures facing their own controversies.

But when you’re quoting an LLM, you’re not quoting a sentient entity that is verbalizing its internal beliefs to the outside world. Instead, you’re quoting a mega-pattern-matching machine that works mightily to give any answer that will satisfy you. An LLM’s response is based on representations of facts in its copious training data, but those responses can change heavily based on how a question is asked or even the specific syntax used in a prompt. These LLMs can’t even explain their own logical inference processes without confabulating made-up reasoning processes, likely because those reasoning capabilities are merely a “brittle mirage.”

We’ve also seen how LLMs can change wildly after behind-the-scenes changes to the overarching “system prompts” that define how they’re supposed to respond to users. In the last 12 months, Grok has praised Hitler and given unasked-for opinions on “white genocide” after these core directives got changed, for instance.

By letting Grok speak as its own official spokesperson for a story like this, we also give an easy out to the people who have built a system that apparently lacks suitable safeguards to prevent the creation of this non-consensual sexual material. And when those people respond to press inquiries with an automated message simply saying “Legacy Media Lies” (as Reuters reported), that kiss-off should be treated as a clear indication of how casually xAI is treating the accusations. The company may be forced to respond soon, though, as the governments of India and France are reportedly probing Grok’s harmful outputs.

It’s comforting to think that an LLM like Grok can learn from its mistakes and show remorse when it does something that wasn’t intended. In the end, though, it’s the people who created and manage Grok who should be showing that remorse, rather than letting the press run after the malleable “apologies” of a lexical pattern-matching machine.</div>

            <h2>Elon Musk After His Grok AI Did Disgusting Things to Literal Children: “Way Funnier”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/elon-comment-grok-children">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok began fielding an influx of stunningly inappropriate requests. Though the AI has long been known to have loose guardrails, users suddenly swarmed the AI to generate either nudes or sexually charged images of X users based on photos they posted to the site — and it obliged. Even worse, some of the individuals it took requests for appeared to be minors. The trend was so prolific that AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated the bot was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute.

Equally stunning is that the chatbot’s maker, xAI, has remained silent on the issue, despite it gaining international attention in news media and on X, where the bot operates. So has owner and CEO Musk — except for one instance in which he completely failed to meet the gravity of the situation.

“Grok’s viral image moment has arrived, it’s a little different than the Ghibli one was though,” one writer who covers AI euphemistically observed in a tweet.

For the most part, the only acknowledgment of wrongdoing has come from Grok itself, including in one widely seen post where it issued an “apology” — an output that many media outlets interpreted as Grok speaking for xAI.

“Dear Community, I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt,” it wrote. “This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM.”

“It was a failure in safeguards,” it added, “and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.”

In another tweet spotted by Ars Technica, Grok acknowledged the gravely inappropriate requests using a royal “we.”

Responding to a user who had spent the past few days flagging the issue to Grok, the chatbot wrote: “We appreciate you raising this. As noted, we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them — CSAM is illegal and prohibited.”

“xAI is committed to preventing such issues,” Grok added.

It’s worth noting that these apologies and avowals of fixing the issue are almost certainly complete hokum from Grok. The fact that it’s freely generating such morally reprehensible — not to mention likely illegal — images indicates that it’s at heart designed to be highly compliant to virtually any request; in this case, the expression of contrition was responding to a prompt asking it to “write a heartfelt apology note.”

Nonetheless, it’s both alarming and cowardly that Grok’s writeups are the only acknowledgement we’re getting. Seemingly no one at xAI, Musk included, is brave enough to face the music. xAI rarely addresses the bad behavior of its chief product, but has done so on a handful of occasions in the past, including when Grok infamously began ranting about “white genocide,” a racist conspiracy theory, in response to completely unrelated posts all across the site.

Some of the recent posts, and especially the ones that involved minors, have been removed, with some of the users who made the requests receiving suspensions. But why Grok allowed the generation of these images at all is unclear. One user who is known for stress-testing the chatbot — and was behind the revelation that Grok would be willing to annihilate all Jewish people and kill a billion children — opined that its guardrails were “deliberately” lowered, noting that requests that were once refused were now being accepted.

            <h2>NASA Veterans Disgusted by Plans to Shut Down Its Largest Library</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/nasa-shutting-library-reaction">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, news emerged that NASA’s largest library at its iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC) in Maryland was being shut down.

The optics — especially considering the wider context of the Trump administration’s nakedly anti-science vision for the future of the agency and the shuttering of over a dozen buildings at the center — were bad, to say the least.

At least 13 buildings at Goddard, as well as more than 100 labs, are set to have been shut by March of this year, a major downscaling effort that highlights the Trump administration’s desire to slash NASA’s science budget by more than half in its proposed 2026 fiscal year budget. (The exact budget is still being actively debated, despite already being three months into NASA’s fiscal year.)

NASA insiders are dismayed at the situation playing out at GSFC, arguing that the library was an extremely important resource that’s being unjustifiably wiped out.

“I have a hard time imagining a research center of the high quality that Goddard is, or any center at NASA, how they will operate without a library, without a central collection,” planetary scientist David Williams, who has curated space mission data for NASA’s archives, told NBC News.

“It’s not like we’re so much smarter now than we were in the past,” he told the NYT. “It’s the same people, and they make the same kind of human errors. If you lose that history, you are going to make the same mistakes again.”

In some ways, others have pointed out, it’s business as usual for a large government bureaucracy.

“NASA has been closing its libraries for a long time,” Keith Cowing, a former NASA astrobiologist who now blogs about the agency at NASA Watch, wrote in a recent post. “Budgetary and building issues are usually the prime reason. Usually, stuff gets moved around and put in storage for years until the storage costs mount and then a portion ends up in someone’s library — somewhere — and the rest gets shipped to some generic [General Services Administration] warehouse — or thrown.”

But the process is agonizing, and important records can be lost through carelessness or error.

“Now it is GSFC’s turn to go through this painful process,” he added.

Officials have cried foul, arguing that plans for shutting the GSFC library existed long before Trump took office last year.

Recently sworn-in NASA administrator Jared Isaacman, for instance, insisted on a thread on X-formerly-Twitter that the move was “part of a long-planned facilities consolidation approved in 2022 under the previous administration.” And NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens described it as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman also took issue with the New York Times‘ framing of the story, accusing the newspaper that its reporting on the matter did not “fully reflect the context NASA shared,” arguing that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials, and that framing has led to several other misleading headlines.”

He also pointed out that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

However, as a NASA spokesperson claimed in a statement to the NYT — which Isaacman quoted himself on X — “some material would be stored in a government warehouse while the rest would be tossed away” following a careful 60-day review.

Isaacman later admitted that he doesn’t “dispute that, after a deliberate review, some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following an “evaluation by an on-site NASA team over a 60-day period.”

In short, there’s clearly some nuance to NASA’s plans — but given the broader political context, the shocked reactions by current and former NASA staffers shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. The Trump administration has indicated that it’s looking to shut down dozens of important science missions as part of its planned 2026 budget, the agency’s biggest budget cut in its 66-year history, if it were to pass.

The administration has also slashed budgets for other important and lifesaving scientific research as part of what’s being characterized as a broader “war on science.”

The Trump administration’s motivations for shutting down over a dozen buildings at the GSFC are a little murky. The 2022 master plan Isaacman was referring to lists “meet affordability goals” as one of its three top long-term priorities, while maintaining “mission capability” and creating a “vision” for “GSFC campuses of the future.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for a more detailed budget breakdown and how much the agency is hoping to save through its “consolidation” efforts.

Isaacman argued that the public discourse surrounding the plans was “unfortunate at a time when the world should be energized by a plan to send NASA astronauts farther into space than ever before, return us to the lunar environment with a commitment to stay, alongside historic investments in an orbital economy and a renewed pursuit of science and discovery.”

But insiders aren’t nearly as optimistic, arguing that shutting the GSFC library would be an immense loss and could make the lives of researchers needlessly difficult.

“We want to restore the data so that it can be used, and in order to restore the data, we need to know, like I said, how the instruments worked, how they were calibrated,” Williams told NBC. “And that information is all over the place and you have to gather it. And, really, the library is one of the main resources for me and people in the future.”

While responding to Isaacman on X, spaceflight engineering expert Dennis Wingo, who has advised NASA as a subject matter expert for decades, argued that the risks of losing important historical records are immense.

“As one who has personally saved and restored NASA data, there is much more to this than you are being told,” Wingo tweeted.

“While what you are saying is the party line, that is not how it works in actuality,” he added, referencing the closing of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center-funded Redstone Science and Information Center in 2019.

After Isaacman once again doubled down in response to Wingo, taking “exception” to “the mischaracterization of this process and its politicization to suggest the current administration is engaging in some sort of book burning,” Wingo remained unconvinced.

“Libraries and archives around the world are being ‘consolidated’ out of existence,” he wrote. “I can tell you for an absolute fact that many of the people making the determinations on what is historically valuable or not are not qualified to do so.”

“I have personally seen this happen multiple times over the past 35 years,” Wingo added.

In the early 2000s, Wingo and NASA Watch’s Cowing discovered tapes in a remote warehouse of NASA’s Lunar Orbiter spacecraft missions in the late 1960s, which, per Cowing, NASA “wanted to get rid of.”

“We drove the tapes up to NASA Ames in two large rental trucks and assembled a team of retirees and college kids to bring the data back from the past at resolutions simply impossible to achieve back in the day,” Cowing recalled in his latest blog post.

“I urge you to not allow the dumpsterization of our scientific history,” Wingo concluded in his plea to Isaacman.

            <div id="article-text">The tech industry is making sure kids will be hooked on AI for generations — by proactively sinking its tendrils deep into the education system, long before we understand the effects of the tech on young minds.

Top leaders in the space, from Microsoft to OpenAI, are pouring millions of dollars into schools, colleges, and universities, often providing students with access to their AI products. The justification, touted in a fresh New York Times piece by both by tech companies and the educators receiving the funding, is that the tools will accelerate learning and prepare students for a world driven by AI.

But the reality outside of this hype is a lot murkier and darker. Some research suggests that AI actually inhibits learning, with one notable study conducted by researchers from Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon finding that it atrophies critical thinking skills.

Even more urgently, the safety of AI chatbots is looking more dubious by the day, as significant media and clinical attention is being paid toward the phenomenon of so-called AI psychosis, in which users — many of them teens and young adults — are driven into delusional mental spirals through their interactions with human-sounding AIs. Some of these spirals have even to led to suicide and murder.

New tech always causes friction in the realm of education, and teachers once clutched their pearls about the calculator, too. But never before has a tool so thoroughly outsourced the act of cognition — nevermind acted as a personal assistant, friend, or lover.

Worst of all is that AI companies are rapidly making inroads into education before the dust can settle on any of these urgent questions. In the US, Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the third-largest school system in the country, deployed a version of Google’s Gemini chatbot for its more than 100,000 high school students, the NYT noted. On the other side of the learning dynamic, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic, have poured more than $23 million into one of the largest teacher’s unions in the nation to provide members with training to use their AI products.

Abroad, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, announced last month what it called the “world’s first nationwide AI-powered education program” to deploy its chatbot Grok to more than 5,000 public schools in El Salvador. Last June, Microsoft partnered with the Ministry of Education in Thailand to provide free online lessons on using AI to hundreds of thousands students, per the NYT, before later announcing free AI training for nearly as many teachers.

Some experts fear that we’re making the same mistake as with the global push to expand access to computers, known as One Laptop per Child, which did not improve students’ scores or their cognitive abilities, according to studies cited by the Times.

“With One Laptop per Child, the fallouts included wasted expenditure and poor learning outcomes,” Steven Vosloo, a digital policy specialist at UNICEF, wrote in a recent post spotted by the NYT. “Unguided use of AI systems may actively de-skill students and teachers.”

There’s an argument to be made that exposing children in a controlled environment like a school might better prepare them for their inevitable encounters with AI chatbots, providing them with the nous to safely and effectively use them. Yet top AI companies with billions in the bank have shown they’re, so far, unable to keep a tight leash on their tools and ensure they’re consistently safe. (OpenAI recently admitted that its own data showed that perhaps half million ChatGPT users every were having conversations that showed signs of psychosis, a revelation that hasn’t deterred it from letting its large language models power children’s toys.)

We’re still only beginning to grapple with the consequences that another digital innovation, social media, has had on children and teens — and now the tech industry wants to rush into the next digital experiment before we even know whether it’s safe.

The truth, clearly, is that AI companies have no idea if their products are safe or helpful for students. But in the rush to carve out market share in a competitive space, they aren’t wasting any time finding out.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amidst mostly unfounded fears that artificial intelligence is coming for our jobs, it turns out there’s one gig AI is pretty excellent at: streaming on Twitch.

Meet Neuro-sama, a cutesy AI-powered character which is now the top streamer on Twitch by active subscriber-count, according to Twitch Tracker. At the time of writing, Nuero-sama — streaming via the Twitch channel Vedal987 — has 165,268 paid active subscribers, well above the second-highest channel, the human-ran Jynxzi.

On Twitch, each paid subscriber is valued at $5 a month, some of which is split with Twitch. According to an estimate by Dextero, that means Neuro-sama is raking in at least $400,000 a month just from subscriptions — and that’s on top of random viewer donations, sponsorships, and ad revenue.

Over the past few years, content creators known as VTubers have taken Twitch by storm. VTubers are essentially like regular streamers, except they use digital motion-capture effects to alter their voice and appearance, often taking on cartoon-like personas to stand out and appeal to viewers looking for something beyond the physical realm.

Neuro-sama takes the concept one step beyond. Despite appearances, the avatar isn’t merely puppeted by a human streamer, but is entirely AI-generated. The channel’s owner, identified only by the handle Vedal, has been running the channel as his full-time job since at least 2023, according to Bloomberg.

Per the publication’s reporting, the avatar’s speech is first generated by a large language model (LLM) before being converted to audio via another text-to-speech AI application.

Though the AI avatar was originally designed to live-stream the rhythm game Osu, it has since developed a life of its own, discussing random topics with various subscribers who communicate with the LLM via Twitch’s baked-in live chat features.

“Part of it is definitely the novelty,” Vedal told Bloomberg of the character’s popularity at the time. “Part of it is some of the things she says. She can be quite chaotic, saying things humans wouldn’t really say.”

Though Neuro-sama sits atop the Twitch throne at the moment, there is still a ways to go if the channel is ever to become the all-time subscription record holder: it sits at number eight on that list — still an accomplishment that was once unthinkable.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In mid-December 2025, the editors of Merriam-Webster’s dictionary chose “slop” as their word of the year. Their definition: “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”

It’s no mystery why they felt the term best described 2025. It was a year beset by uncanny AI-generated ads, search engine decay, and a tidal wave of AI music spamming streaming apps.

Though the choice clearly struck a popular nerve, not everybody appreciated the dictionary’s cheeky dig at AI companies and the cottage industry of slop they’ve engineered. In a year-end roundup shared via LinkedIn, for instance, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made it clear that he’d prefer we all left the term in 2025.

“We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication,” Nadella wrote in a rambling post flagged by Windows Central, arguing that humanity needs to learn to accept AI as the “new equilibrium” of human nature. (As WC points out, there’s actually growing evidence that AI harms human cognitive ability.)

Going on, Nadella said that we now know enough about “riding the exponentials of model capabilities” as well as managing AI’s “‘jagged’ edges” to allow us to “get value of AI in the real world.”

“Ultimately, the most meaningful measure of progress is the outcomes for each of us,” the CEO concludes, in an impressive deluge of corporate-speak that may or may not itself be AI-generated. “It will be a messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Nadella’s comments come as Microsoft users have revolted en masse against the company’s AI products, which have largely been forced on them without consent. Earlier in December, it was reported that a staggering one billion PCs were still running Windows 10, even though a full half were eligible to upgrade to the AI-satured Windows 11.

That being the case, it’s obvious the CEO has a specific axe to grind with the people who refuse to go gentle into the sloppified night. Tech CEOs like Nadella might talk a big game about altruism and human achievement, but at the end of the day, AI is a product — and like any product, it lives or dies by consumer demand.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a new interview with The Financial Times, Yann LeCun, one of the so-called godfathers of AI, finally dished on his abrupt exit from Meta in November.

From how he tells it, most of it boils down to his increasingly fraught relationship with CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and his new golden boy, Alexandr Wang, who ended up bossing LeCun around even though he’s nearly four decades younger.

LeCun had been at Zuckerberg’s company for over a decade, where, as chief AI scientist, he had the freedom to carry out all kinds of esoteric AI research without necessarily having to worry about developing a profitable product. LeCun described Meta, then Facebook, as a “tabula rasa with a carte blanche.” “Money was clearly not going to be a problem,” he told the FT.

Then, in November 2022, ChatGPT came out,  and the whole world went bananas for AI chatbots. AI chatbots and their human-like capabilities for conversation are powered by large language models, something LeCun helped pioneer with his foundational work on neural networks. When Zuckerberg ordered LeCun develop Meta’s own LLM, he agreed under the condition that Llama would be open source and free.

The Llama models “changed the entire industry,” LeCun said, and were a hit with AI researchers because of their power and open source nature.

The success didn’t last, though; the latest Llama 4 model, released last April, was dead on arrival and reviled as an instantly-outdated flop. LeCun blames the failure on Zuckerberg pressuring LeCun’s unit to accelerate AI development.

“We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,” LeCun told the FT. “When you do this, you fall behind.”

The rift, however, goes deeper. LeCun views LLMs as a “dead end” for building even more powerful, “superintelligent” models that rival or surpass human capabilities. An entirely different architecture called “world models” which seek to understand the physical world, not just language, is needed to make the next major leap in the tech.

According to LeCun, Zuckerberg actually liked LeCun’s world model research, but didn’t put his money where his mouth is. Instead, Zuckerberg launched a new LLM-focused Superintelligence Labs last year, separate from LeCun’s lab, and offered several hundred million dollar contracts to attract top talent. All the talent that came in, LeCun complained, have been “completely LLM-pilled.”

Zuckerberg’s marquee new-hire was Alexandr Wang, the founder and former CEO of the AI data annotation startup Scale AI, which provides an essential service for training AI models, but doesn’t build or design them. Zuckerberg poured $14 billion into Scale AI to buy a 49 percent stake and, as part of that deal, Wang left and joined Meta to lead the new Superintelligence Labs. As a consequence, LeCun was forced to start reporting to Wang.

The move raised questions from the get-go, including whether Wang, 29, had the experience and background to build massive AI models, something his company didn’t do. LeCun doesn’t leave us wondering where he stands on Wang’s hiring, calling him “young” and “inexperienced.”

Be that as it may, LeCun, considered to be a godfather of the entire field, was now taking orders from Wang. LeCun seemed cool about this at first when the interviewer brought up the new hierarchy. “The average age of a Facebook engineer at the time was 27,” Lecun told the FT. “I was twice the age of the average engineer.”

But when the interviewer pointed out that the younger generation weren’t telling him what to do until the 29-year-old Wang showed up, LeCun seemingly let his true feelings be known.

“Alex isn’t telling me what to do either,” LeCun sneered. “You don’t tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don’t tell a researcher like me what to do.”

He’ll be his own boss going forward. LeCun has launched a new world-model-focused startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, which is targeting a $3 billion valuation. LeCun will serve as executive chairman, allowing him a similar degree of freedom to pursue research he once enjoyed at Meta, according to the FT.

            <h2>China’s Hesai will double production as lidar sensor industry shakes out</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/chinas-hesai-will-double-production-as-lidar-sensor-industry-shakes-out/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chinese lidar maker Hesai announced plans on Monday to double its production capacity from 2 million units to 4 million units this year, as it looks to corner the global market for the laser-based sensors. That would be well up from the 1-million-plus unit mark that Hesai hit in 2025.

Hesai’s push to grab more market share comes just one month after leading U.S. lidar-maker Luminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That company is not expected to continue operating once its bankruptcy plan is approved, though it is looking to sell the lidar business.

Hesai has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years and is now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong stock exchanges. That’s despite fighting an uphill battle against the U.S. government, which has accused the company of working closely with China’s military industry — a charge that Hesai has challenged.

At the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Hesai told reporters it was able to double the production target because of “accelerating demand” in the automotive and robotics industries.

The company’s automotive efforts have been buoyed by the Chinese car market’s adoption of lidar sensors, which Hesai said is now in 25% of new electric cars sold in the country. It also claimed that many new vehicles in China are expected to integrate between three to six lidar sensors per car, “significantly expanding Hesai’s addressable market.” Hesai boasts 24 automotive customers, including a “top European” automaker, and said it has 4 million orders for its newest ATX lidar sensor.

Automotive has proved to be a fickle market for lidar sensors outside of China. That was one of the contributing factors to Luminar’s downfall, according to the company’s own bankruptcy filings. While Luminar secured deals to integrate its lidar sensors on Volvo, Polestar, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles, those plans fell apart. Volvo had at one point agreed to buy 1.1 million lidar sensors from Luminar, but delays to its new vehicle programs and cost overruns caused the Swedish automaker to back out of the deal. (Volvo ultimately only purchased around 10,000 sensors from Luminar.)

Robotics is not guaranteed to be a successful market for lidar sensors, but some players besides Hesai see great promise. San Francisco-based Ouster, which acquired rival player Velodyne in 2023 as the lidar industry began to consolidate, has said it believes robotics represents a $14 billion market opportunity. This includes not just humanoid robotics, but last-mile delivery robots and military applications.

At CES, Hesai is showcasing a robotic lawnmower and a robotic dog that use the company’s JT series lidar sensor. The company also hinted at its inclusion in humanoid robots as well. It has struck deals to provide lidar sensors to autonomous vehicle companies like Pony AI, Motional, WeRide, and Baidu.

Hesai also boasted it has helped drive down the cost of lidar sensors by 99.5% in just eight years. That, too, was a contributing factor to Luminar’s downfall; “pressure to reduce costs due to lower price points of China-based competitors” has been regularly listed in the company’s bankruptcy filings as the second-most important factor that explains why the U.S. company found it so hard to build up a self-sustaining business.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">BMW is finally getting the next-generation Alexa voice assistant and it’s coming with a generative AI upgrade.

Amazon said Monday that the 2026 BMW iX3 will be equipped with Alexa+, the same generative AI tech that launched in millions of the e-commerce giant’s smart devices last year. This will be the first vehicle to come with Amazon’s next-generation voice assistant, the companies announced during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The launch is one part of Amazon’s effort to bring its LLM-powered voice and digital assistant to every device — whether handheld or in the driver’s seat — touched by consumers. Alexa+ is already in more than 600 million devices. And automotive is next on the list.

Bringing a custom version of Alexa+ into the BMW iX3 will be an important test for Amazon. Automakers have struggled for years to bring a voice assistant inside vehicles that can handle complex functions and requests that don’t end with the driver yelling in frustration. Efforts to develop natural language processing — a form of AI that lets computers understand and respond to human speech — have been in the works for more than a decade. And while progress has been made, these systems can still be easily stumped by humans.

BMW and Amazon’s Alexa+ partnership has been three years in the making.

BMW announced in 2022 that Amazon Alexa would be the foundation of its next-generation voice assistant. This meant BMW wouldn’t just embed Alexa into its vehicles, but would use Amazon’s technology platform known as Alexa Custom Assistant to build its own custom version. That timeline was extended as Amazon worked on an automotive version of Alexa+, an overhauled voice assistant developed and powered by large language models that promises to deliver seamless and natural conversations, like talking to a human.

Alexa+ was built using Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets AWS customers build apps using generative AI models from Amazon and other third-party partners. Customers, like BMW, can then customize the app with their proprietary data.

The end result, according to Amazon, is a voice assistant that can break down complex requests, reason through steps, and take actions across different services. For instance, Amazon says users can start a conversation with their Alexa+-enabled Echo speaker in the home and continue it in their BMW. Once in the car, the user can make requests through the Alexa+ assistant that might normally require opening up different apps, like say music, navigation, and a home security system.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/lucid-motors-doubled-ev-output-in-2025-after-early-gravity-suv-struggles/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lucid Motors built twice as many electric vehicles in 2025 as it did in the prior year, a sign that the company has bounced back from early production struggles with its new Gravity SUV.

The company announced Monday that it finished the year having built 18,378 EVs, with 8,412 of those coming in the fourth quarter alone. That’s more than Lucid built at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory in the first half of the year. Lucid also said it delivered — meaning sold — 15,841 vehicles across the whole year, a 55% increase over 2024’s figures.

The stronger finish to 2025 sets Lucid up for an all-important year that will see the company start building the first vehicle on its new mid-sized EV platform. The company has said this first vehicle will cost around $50,000, putting it near the same part of the market as the Tesla Model Y and Rivian’s upcoming R2 SUV.

The numbers still pale in comparison to the projections Lucid Motors threw around when it went public in a $4 billion reverse merger in 2021. At that time, the company claimed it would deliver 135,000 vehicles in 2025, with 86,000 of those being Gravity SUVs, 42,000 being Air sedans, and the remaining 7,000 coming from its yet-to-debut mid-sized EV.

Those targets quickly became unrealistic as Lucid ran into production, supply, and demand challenges for both of its vehicles, all while navigating an automotive market that was severely disrupted by the pandemic. The company particularly struggled in early 2025 as it started to ramp up production of the Gravity SUV. It has since been dealing with a number of quality issues on the vehicle, to the level that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to customers in December saying that he shared in their “frustration.”

“Lingering software problems have unfortunately affected our customers’ experience and satisfaction. I would like to assure you that we are laser focused on addressing these issues,” he wrote.

The update represents the first major Fire TV release in years from a user experience perspective, the company says, and is accompanied by a refreshed version of the Fire TV app and the arrival of new premium Fire TV televisions with colorful frames.

The company saw the need for a change to the Fire TV’s look and feel as the amount of streaming content has exploded over the years. Fire TV customers today can access TV and movies via purchases, rentals, and streaming services, but also have apps for viewing short-form content on the TV, access to numerous live TV streams, premium content, podcasts, music, games, and more.

“As we brought that content forward, the [user interface] got a little cluttered — a lot of stuff and a lot of rows,” explained Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss in an interview with TechCrunch. “We know the data — there’s a lot of time spent searching,” he added. “We…know that it could just be easier.”

The new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what’s up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row.

Before, you could only pin six apps to the Fire TV’s home screen — a common user complaint. But the update has reduced the app icons’ size, allowing more to be visible on the home screen, and offers you 20 app slots you can scroll through.

At the top of the screen, navigation has been simplified into obvious categories like Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. A search button is available to the left of the Home tab.

Across the new tabs, Fire TV centralizes access to the content you’re already watching, and what’s available across services you’re subscribed to. It also offers you the ability to discover new content, including recommended movies or shows (in rows labeled “For You”), free movies you can stream, lists of the top movies or shows, and other subscription content you may want to try.

These pages don’t offer infinite scrolling, but they’re lengthy as they represent the depth of content available on streaming services.

The new live TV tab organizes the live content from the services that have live TV streams built into them, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you happen to subscribe. The sports section, more specifically, includes access to the live games that are on now and other scheduled sports content.

Other TV features are tucked away under the three-line hamburger menu icon, like Games, Art & Photos, the Appstore, Music Video & Audio, a now-universal watchlist (“My Stuff”), Settings, and other options.

To make it easier to access commonly used settings, you can also now long-press on the Home button to adjust settings for the display and audio, set a sleep timer, use accessibility features, access smart home features, and more. From this panel, you can do things like adjust the TV brightness, boost the audio dialogue, or display your Ring camera’s feed on screen while you watch, among other things.

The redesign also includes rewritten code that makes the interface move faster on some devices, Amazon claims.

“On our most popular devices, this is 20% to 30% faster for the same functions, because it’s all about getting people to what they want to watch, fast,” notes Marcuss.

Of course, Alexa+ access is built in, allowing users to ask questions, find content, or even do things like call an Uber. This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show’s square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art.

Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription.

The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. The idea is that people may want to browse for something to watch on their phones instead of just having one person drive the content discovery and search experience with the remote.

The refreshed Fire TV interface and mobile app will begin rolling out in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S.

Later this spring, the redesign will come to more countries and more devices, including Fire TV Cube (3rd Gen), the latest generation Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series, and TVs made by partners like Hisense, Panasonic, and TCL.

It will also be available at launch on the new Amazon Ember Artline TVs (see below).

The Ember Artline TVs are Amazon’s latest televisions that ship with a frame that can match your room’s style and colors. They’ll come in 55-inch and 65-inch options, starting at $899.

The new TVs themselves offer 4K QLED screens with 450 nits of brightness. The display is also thin, at one-and-a-half inches, and has a matte screen finish to reduce glare.

The TVs also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6.

However, the big selling point is the 10 different frame options you can choose from, offering a variety of colors, textures, and geometries. This allows customers to take better advantage of Fire TV’s Ambient features, which include displaying art when the TV is not in use.

The colors available include Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver.

Fire TV comes with access to over 2,000 pieces of free art, or you can use your own photos.

You can also ask Alexa+ to display certain photos from your Amazon Photos collections using commands like, “Alexa, create a slideshow of our family trip to Colorado” or “Alexa, show photos from our wedding.”

Correction: An Amazon rep previously told us an incorrect figure for nits. It’s a max 450 nits for the Artline TVs’ brightness.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon’s AI-powered overhaul of its digital assistant, now known as Alexa+, is coming to the web. On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.

While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s own Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.

Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home.

Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a backseat.)

On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks, for instance exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, but it also means doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.

More recently, Amazon has been integrating more services with Alexa+, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.

The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more.

In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place.

This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed.

This ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right.

“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons.

He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”

But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.

Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since its debut of Alexa+ early last year.

Rausch tells us that tens of millions of consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy smart home customers also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.

However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are over-represented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”

“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google believes AI can improve the TV-watching experience, which is why it brought its Gemini AI to Google TV devices in November. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep-dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings.

The company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead.

Designed for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors.

You could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”

Gemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required.

But Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too.

At CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.

Gemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments. They can also apply artistic styles to their photos and videos using Gemini AI and turn their memories into cinematic slideshows, says Google.

However, perhaps the most useful feature is one that gives you the power to optimize the TV’s settings using only your voice.

Now, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option.

Google says the new Gemini features will require the Google TV devices to be running Android TV OS 14 or higher, and they will need an internet connection. Not all languages, countries, or devices will be supported at launch, and users must also have a Google account to access the Gemini for TV experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Separating the art from the artist can be easier debated than done. In 1967, Roland Barthes infamously argued in his essay “The Death of the Author” that a writer’s biography should be irrelevant to the meaning or value of their work. In 1983, Nora Ephron asserted the opposite in her novel, Heartburn: “Everything is copy.”

Today’s pop culture has tended to agree with Ephron’s take: Confession fuels the biggest songs; celebrity memoirs dominate best-seller lists. Whether art is inextricable from the artist is central to many of the buzzy dramas vying for trophies during this year’s awards season, too. Hamnet imagines the intimate origins of Shakespeare’s famed tragedy Hamlet. Blue Moon and Jay Kelly follow men who have infused their work with so much of their personal life that they find it hard to exist outside of their career. These movies observe how art can function as therapy for the creator, extracting a truth that they couldn’t grasp otherwise.

Sentimental Value, an emotionally layered film up for eight Golden Globes this weekend, complicates that perspective. It follows a family of storytellers: Gustav (played by Stellan Skarsgård) is a celebrated director hoping to cast his estranged daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve), an actor, in his first project in 15 years. Nora’s sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), is a historian who helps Gustav with researching his script. The tender drama is the latest from the Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier who, along with his co-writer, Eskil Vogt, has made plenty of features about creative types. The protagonists of 2006’s Reprise are novelists. The story of 2015’s Louder Than Bombs hinges on the work of a war photographer. The aimless heroine of their 2021 Oscar-nominated romantic dramedy, The Worst Person in the World, abandons medical school to pursue writing and photography instead.

Read: The Worst Person in the World is devastatingly relatable

Focusing on artistic characters became a pattern—enough that conceiving of Sentimental Value, in part, as a movie about moviemaking brought “a certain shame to Eskil and me,” Trier told me recently, grinning sheepishly at the memory. “We were like, ‘Oh no, are we really doing a film about actors and directors?’” The conceit, they worried, could come off as extremely narrow; the plot’s emphasis on the production of Gustav’s movie could pull focus away from the emotional stakes, turning Sentimental Value into commentary on the film industry instead.

But when I watched the film, I found myself, like many viewers, wondering something different: whether the father-daughter relationships depicted echoed any of Trier’s own feelings about becoming a parent. Those reactions didn’t surprise the filmmaker. Since the movie’s debut at the Cannes Film Festival, Trier has spoken often about how having children affected his mindset going into Sentimental Value. In one interview, he conceded that the movie was in part about “exorcising fears” about fatherhood; when we spoke, however, he seemed to bristle at that phrasing. He wasn’t trying to extract his personal anxieties and commit them to celluloid, he clarified. Making his private thoughts so public in his work, he said, “would be my nightmare.”

If anything, Sentimental Value is about that tension between wanting to explain the origin of your ideas and wanting to distance yourself from your own creations. It also interrogates the cost of drawing from specific, individual experiences. “You deserve something more personal,” Gustav tells Nora when pitching her his screenplay, failing to notice how dismissive the comment sounds of her career. It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of her artistry, too: Everything Nora does on stage has always been “personal.” When embodying a character, she can express herself more authentically, something Gustav would know if he ever saw her perform. But Nora suffers from severe stage fright as a result; being able to access her feelings under a fictional guise doesn’t mean she’s necessarily embracing them. The truth behind the most intimate art can remain a mystery, Sentimental Value posits—even for the artist.

A film is “lifeless,” Trier said, unless its viewers discover what is personal to them as they watch. “You have a wonderful word in English that we don’t have in Norwegian,” he said, “and that is verisimilitude, the idea of some sort of contract with the viewer that conveys a sense of truthfulness, yet it’s a construct. It’s a code.” The goal, in other words, is for the story to feel genuine without being explicitly so.

That can happen when a performer imbues her character with her own nature. In one of the film’s most affecting moments, Agnes visits a melancholic Nora, who has been unwilling to perform after Gustav moved forward with his movie without her; he recruited an American star, Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), to play the part he’d written for Nora, and has immediately bonded with Rachel. After Agnes encourages Nora to read their father’s script, the sisters marvel at how Gustav reveals, in his writing, a side of himself they’d never seen. Nora goes on to wonder how Agnes turned out stable in such a forbidding household. “I had you,” Agnes replies, before crawling onto Nora’s bed to embrace her. Agnes then whispers, “I love you”—a line that Lilleaas came up with on the spot.

The ad-lib dramatically changed the scene from how Trier and Vogt had written it. The dynamic between the sisters was originally more antagonistic: Agnes would be carefree, the one in the family hoping to “make everyone happy through humor and avoidance,” Trier told me—much to her sister’s annoyance. But Lilleaas, Trier explained, conveyed a “calm, grounded, truthful honesty” when they first met, outside of a formal audition. Her demeanor inspired him: “I could look into her eyes as we talked and I felt, You’re real, like really grounded. And then I thought, Let’s reinterpret Agnes.”

Realism and fiction occasionally do combine in Sentimental Value in more anticipated ways. The film is purposefully a family affair for Trier: His two children appear briefly as Nora and Agnes in flashbacks. Gustav’s screenplay is inspired by memories of his mother’s imprisonment in a Nazi camp; her experiences echo those of Trier’s paternal grandfather, the filmmaker Erik Løchen. (Trier has reviewed the files on his grandfather’s captivity the same way Agnes does in one scene, studying the reports about how her grandmother was tortured.) And the actor who narrates the opening scene, describing an essay Nora wrote as a child that anthropomorphized the family home, is Bente Børsum. She’s a celebrated performer in Norway who starred in Løchen’s 1959 film, The Chasers.

Trier doesn’t expect audiences to know any of the above. Sentimental Value avoids explaining, for instance, who the speaker is in relation to the characters on-screen, let alone the fact that a younger Børsum had seen her mother taken to a German camp, too. “Her voice held a lot of weight for me,” Trier said of his choice to include the 91-year-old actor. The film draws power from the subtle specificity; Børsum’s voice, low and knowing, comes suffused with an ineffable meaning. The viewer immediately feels encouraged to pay closer attention to the narration.

These veiled decisions inform the movie Gustav eventually directs as well: He’d wanted the shoot to take place inside Agnes and Nora’s childhood home, but eventually settles for a reproduction on a back lot, a series of ceiling-less facades. A viewer wouldn’t be able to tell that it’s a set, but the care and history Gustav has brought to it lends it an abstract profundity. The opportunity afforded by art for artists to examine—or just merely observe—themselves is essential. “I need to distance myself from the characters to be able to create them,” Trier said. What’s on-screen is akin to “a counter-life,” he explained. “It’s not intended to say, ‘Hey, look at me!’ It’s saying, ‘I’m doing this about something that’s deeply personal, and yet I feel that it’s over there.’”

A film such as Sentimental Value, then, operates like a time capsule for its maker: It reveals its potency to Trier only in the rearview, when he revisits what had been on his mind. “It’s like conversations with friends,” Trier said. “If someone says, ‘I sense around our latest coffees over the last year, that you talk a lot about this. What’s the purpose?’ I’m like, ‘What do you mean, purpose?’” He laughed. “Shit, I don’t know. But I know I care about it.”

            <h2>Why Authors Can’t Let Go of Greek Myths</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/the-way-to-colonos-kay-cicellis-sophocles-book-review/685414/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I was 8 or 9 years old, my uncle and aunt gave me a copy of D’Aulaires’ Book of Greek Myths, a standard-bearer for children’s folklore that was originally published in 1962. I was immediately dazzled by the book: D’Aulaires’ was my first exposure to Greek mythology, and I marveled at its vibrant cosmology, its richly illustrated tales of deities whose omnipotence was matched only by their strikingly human, self-indulgent caprice.

Over the years, I committed to memory the elaborate organizing logic of Greek antiquity. The immortal residents of Mount Olympus—philandering Zeus and his cascading (sometimes circular) family tree—governed every aspect of human existence. I was daunted by such a deterministic universe, in which the free will of mortals counted for so little. Yet I was compelled, even comforted, by the coherence of this worldview, in which one’s life was entirely foretold.

The Greek writer Kay Cicellis, who died in 2001, might have shuddered at such a sunny view of fate. One year before Ingri and Edgar Parin D’Aulaire published their compendium of Greek myths, Cicellis released her second work of fiction, The Way to Colonos, which ruthlessly dramatizes the limits of individual freedom and the agony of facing one’s powerlessness. The book has recently been reissued at what feels like a propitious moment, when modern treatments of Greek myth proliferate, many of them adapting stories about destiny and order for a chaotic and individualistic time.

Cicellis’s book consists of three stories that parallel Sophoclean tragedies—“The Way to Colonos” (Oedipus at Colonos), “The Return” (Electra), and “The Exile” (Philoctetes). In an author’s note, Cicellis calls any connection to the Greek playwright’s work a “coincidence”: She was inspired by the original myths, rather than the plays based on them. Each of Cicellis’s retellings transforms its myth into a short story set in mid-20th-century Greece, juxtaposing an ancient sense of fate against the messy uncertainty of modernity. In The Way to Colonos, the horror that emerges is more suppressed and internal than in the ancient texts. The violence is psychological and rarely fatal, in marked contrast to that in Sophocles’s work (in other words, nobody gouges out their eyes after having mistakenly slept with their own mother). And unlike Sophocles’s plays, in which the deities are persistently invoked, Cicellis’s universe is spiritually arid. Her discontented characters seem to wander beneath an empty firmament.

But make no mistake: This is not a world of freedom and abandon. Each of Cicellis’s young protagonists arrives at the grim realization that their life is circumscribed not by a god but by the pull of obligation to an undeserving parent or mentor. In these stories, Cicellis presents fate as the imposition of familial or vocational inheritance, rather than the decree of a higher power. It is something silently assumed, perhaps even chosen—if only because no other choice seems possible.

Read: Don’t judge I’m Glad My Mom Died by its title

In the first story, “The Way to Colonos,” Antigone and her infirm, recently widowed father sail to the titular island, an isolated and inhospitable place, to make a new home. Antigone views their relocation as a dual exile: Both of them have committed “evil” acts, “indigestible as stone.” Antigone had an affair with a married man. Her father, after quarreling with Antigone’s mother, locked her out of their house overnight, which led to a terrible accident. Antigone hopes that on the island, her father will join her in “complete despair,” a mental state characterized less by remorse than by self-abasing catatonia. For Antigone is a merciless judge; she regards both her father and herself as unworthy of rehabilitation, or even the oblivion of death.

“The Return” foregrounds another relationship between parent and daughter, though this one is much more tempestuous. Eugenia (a version of Electra) lives in a filthy house with her lazy, corrupt mother, Madame Nini, and Madame Nini’s lover. The home is always swarming with visitors, many of them young women. Eugenia wonders bitterly if Madame Nini and her lover are running a brothel, or perhaps an underground abortion network.

As disgusted as she is by her mother, Eugenia is equally obsessed with her. She skulks around the house, scheming for opportunities to pick a fight. She writes constantly to her younger brother, Orestes, begging him to return from school and reestablish domestic order. When he does come home, he is repulsed by the squalor of his mother’s house and by the violent antagonism between Madame Nini and Eugenia. He presses Eugenia to leave with him.

Eugenia has other ideas. “Orestes! Kill her!” she demands, in response to his proposal. But unlike his Sophoclean namesake, Orestes is bewildered by this escalation and refuses. Ultimately, Eugenia binds herself to Madame Nini, “like a seaman on deck who has cut off the moorings of his ship and abandoned himself to his element.” In Sophocles’s play, the final acts of violence provide a kind of catharsis. By contrast, Eugenia condemns herself to a future of festering tension and fury.

Cicellis’s third revised myth, “The Exile,” foregrounds a nonfamilial intergenerational bond. Stamos, 19, is a version of Neoptolemus, son of the warrior Achilles. He serves as a squire of sorts to Greek guerrilla soldiers who, after the Second World War, operated as Communist resistance forces in the mountains. At the start of the story, he has traveled to an obscure island in order to convince Rigas, an exiled former commander, to return to the ranks. Stamos quickly romanticizes the soldier’s isolation—his freedom from social expectations—and begins to dream of defecting. Rigas actually detests his remote existence, but he adopts the persona of a rugged maestro who lives off the land. Eventually, he is forced to drop the charade. “You offered me a role. I took it,” Rigas explains to Stamos. “You gave me something to be. What did you expect?”

Unlike with Antigone and Eugenia, whose perceptions of their respective parents curdled long ago, the reader watches Stamos experience disillusionment. Reverence for one’s elders, Cicellis implies, is a dangerous kind of fan fiction. Nonetheless, Stamos’s disappointment does not prompt him to sever ties with the guerrillas, and he follows them back to the harbor, just as both Antigone and Eugenia adhere to their wretched parents.

Rachel Cusk, who wrote the foreword to the new edition of Cicellis’s trilogy, argues that the author’s “young protagonists claim as a freedom the right to hate or disapprove of the adults who hold so-called authority over them, when the forces of tragedy and fate have decreed that no such freedom exists.” In my view, this reading gives the characters more agency than they seem to think they have. Cicellis’s young characters may despise the elders in their orbits, because even a universe governed by fate does not dictate human emotion. But that is not freedom: They are otherwise impotent, incapable of emancipating themselves from the adults who have harmed or disappointed them.

There is something dreadful in the resignation depicted at each story’s denouement—in the cool viciousness of Antigone’s sense of justice, and in Eugenia’s realization that while her mother lives, she must be at her side. The brutality of “The Exile” manifests in its portrayal of enlightenment rendered powerless: Stamos learns that Rigas isn’t who he thought he was, and yet he does not reject him. If these adaptations retain the solemnity of a Greek myth, it is less because of their source material than because their young characters come to understand their lives as roles they are bound to enact. Tragedy, in The Way to Colonos, emerges from its protagonists’ obliterating desire to follow the story that is most legible to them, in which they are most legible to themselves.

Cicellis understands what I was too young to realize in my earliest encounters with Greek mythology: that our fascination with these stories is fundamentally existential. What, in one’s life, is inevitable? What traits, decisions, or misfortunes exceed a person’s jurisdiction? These are enduring human quandaries.  The abundance of contemporary retellings and revisions, from Kay Cicellis’s trilogy to Emily Wilson’s 2017 retranslation of The Odyssey to Madeline Miller’s 2018 novel, Circe, expose an ongoing fascination with the tension between fate and control. In a modern world where free will is taken as a given, fate might be best understood as the tangle of powers that facilitate or obstruct individual wills. Perhaps it is our intuitive recognition of this dynamic—one not between gods and mortals, but between the free and the vulnerable—that brings us back to this ancient folklore, century after century.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trumps-american-dominance-may-leave-us-with-nothing/685503/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, the world is divided into three spheres of influence: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, all perpetually at war. Sometimes two of the states form an alliance against the third. Sometimes they abruptly switch sides. No reasons are given. Instead, the Party tells the proles, “We have always been at war with Eastasia.” Newspapers and history books are quickly rewritten to make that seem true.

Orwell’s world is fiction, but some want it to become reality. Since well before President Donald Trump’s second term, the idea that the world should have three spheres of influence—an Asia dominated by China, a Europe dominated by Russia, and a Western Hemisphere dominated by the United States—has been kicking around the internet in a desultory way, mostly promoted by Russians who want to control what they call their “near abroad,” or perhaps just want their country, with its weak economy and faltering army, to be mentioned in the same breath as the United States and China.

Back in 2019, Fiona Hill, a National Security Council official in the first Trump administration, testified to a House committee that Russians pushing the creation of spheres of influence had been offering to somehow “swap” Venezuela, their closest ally in Latin America, for Ukraine. Since then, the notion that international relations should promote great-power dominance, not universal values or networks of allies, has spread from Moscow to Washington. The administration’s new National Security Strategy outlines a plan to dominate the Americas, enigmatically describing U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere as “Enlist and Expand,” and downplaying threats from China and Russia. Trump has also issued threats to Denmark, Panama, and Canada, all allies whose sovereignty we now challenge.

Anne Applebaum: The longest suicide note in American history

In some ways, the military raid that took the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro into custody does resemble past American actions, especially the ouster of the Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega in 1989–90. But the use of this new language to explain and justify the Venezuelan raid makes this story very different. At his press conference on Saturday, Trump did not use the word democracy. He did not refer to international law. Instead, he presented a garbled version of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, a policy originally designed to keep foreign imperial powers out of the Americas, calling it something that sounded like the “Donroe Document”: “Under our new National Security Strategy,” he said, reading from prepared remarks, “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again.”

Toward this end, he said the United States would “run” Venezuela, although he didn’t say who would actually be in charge. Viceroy Marco Rubio? Governor-General Pete Hegseth? Asked about María Corina Machado, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, Trump was dismissive. “She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect within the country,” he said.

Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, leads a movement whose presidential candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, received two-thirds of the vote in the 2024 election. Although the state-controlled media backed Maduro, and although Maduro’s police and paramilitaries harassed, arrested, and murdered their supporters, Machado and González not only won; they collected documentation from polling stations proving that they had won. Maduro never produced any such proof. He declared victory anyway.

For the moment, Trump isn’t interested in identifying the legitimate leader of Venezuela. The administration is instead hinting that the U.S. might work with Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, who would presumably keep Maduro’s regime intact—not regime change, in other words, just dictator change. But Trump isn’t trying very hard to provide legitimacy for his own actions either. Before kidnapping Maduro, he did not consult with Congress, U.S. allies, or Venezuela’s neighbors, many of whom might have wanted to contribute to a solution. Although his administration has described this action as a criminal arrest, and has justified it with an indictment for drug smuggling, this isn’t part of any consistent policy. Trump just pardoned the former president of Honduras, who was legitimately indicted on drug charges six years ago.

Read: Making sense of the Venezuela attack

None of this is logical, but it isn’t meant to be: Like the Party in 1984, the would-be dominators of the Western Hemisphere seem to feel no need for logic. If might makes right, if the U.S. gets to do what it wants using any tools it wants in its own sphere, then there is no need for transparency, democracy, or legitimacy. The concerns of ordinary people who live in smaller nations don’t need to be taken into account, because they will not be granted any agency. Their interests are not the concern of the imperial companies that want their mineral resources, or the imperial leaders who need the propaganda of conquest to keep power at home.

Russia’s and China’s responses to Trump’s actions this weekend have been surprisingly soft, given their billions of dollars of investments in Venezuela. Perhaps this is because the language Trump is using to justify the kidnapping of Maduro echoes some of their own narratives. Ukraine belongs to Russia’s sphere is Vladimir Putin’s main argument, after all. Taiwan is part of China’s sphere will be Xi Jinping’s justification if he decides to invade the island. That doesn’t mean that Moscow is really in a position to control Europe, or China to control Asia: The European Union’s combined GDP is nearly 10 times the size of Russia’s, and there aren’t any countries crying out to become Chinese colonies either.

For all of Trump’s bluster, neither are Americans exactly in control of our sphere of influence. Two days after the capture of Maduro, Trump already risks falling victim to his own propaganda, just like Putin. Venezuela, as one former U.S. ambassador to the country recently wrote, is “a failed state riddled with illegal armed groups and foreign terrorist organizations.” The regime has not been removed. The military and various paramilitaries are all still in place, and although some might cooperate with the Trump administration, others might not. With no U.S. troops in Venezuela, will Americans “run” Venezuela by issuing loud statements and threats? By ordering periodic military interventions? Perhaps the administration has made a deal with some members of the regime—that would explain why the American raid met so little opposition—but there is no guarantee that such a deal will produce the kinds of benefits Trump expects. Oil isn’t something that lies around on the ground to be picked up and taken home. It requires long-term investments, relationships, contracts. If the government of Venezuela is likely to fall or change at any moment, none of those will materialize.

But Trump’s error is even more fundamental. The division of the world into spheres of influence implies that smaller countries cannot influence events, and it’s a grave mistake to imagine Venezuelans won’t try. Many of them wanted an American intervention, are overjoyed that Maduro is gone, and no wonder: He and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, together turned the richest country in South America into the poorest, fortifying their ugly security state with guns and surveillance systems purchased from autocracies around the world.

But now that Maduro is gone, the people who fought for years for justice, freedom, and self-determination aren’t going to want to live in a Trump-backed dictatorship staffed with Maduro’s cronies. One Venezuelan exile, who requested anonymity because of risks to his family, told me that on Saturday, he felt like he was on a roller coaster. First the elation of Maduro’s exit, then the shock of Trump’s press conference, then the angry realization that maybe nothing has changed and he still can’t go home.

I don’t think Americans will be any happier if another authoritarian is installed in Venezuela either. Most Americans still do want their country to stand for something other than greed, and most don’t want their expensive military to fight on behalf of Trump’s oil-industry donors. Trump’s pursuit of an illusory sphere of influence is unlikely to bring us peace or prosperity—any more than the invasion of Ukraine brought peace and prosperity to Russians—and this might become clear sooner than anyone expects.

If America is just a regional bully, after all, then our former allies in Europe and Asia will close their doors and their markets to us. Sooner or later, “our” Western Hemisphere will organize against us and fight back. Far from making us more powerful, the pursuit of American dominance will make us weaker, eventually leaving us with no sphere, and no influence, at all.</div>

            <h2>The Fuck-Around-and-Find-Out Presidency</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-monroe-doctrine-venezuela/685502/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In Marco Rubio’s telling, the stunning events in Venezuela on Saturday illustrate an essential truth—possibly the essential truth—about Donald Trump’s presidency: Global leaders cross him at their peril. “I don’t understand yet how they haven’t figured this out,” Trump’s secretary of state told reporters at Mar-a-Lago just hours after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

World leaders could be forgiven for not understanding the simplicity of the Trump Doctrine, especially those who assume that the world’s dominant superpower still possesses complicated mechanisms for the manufacture of foreign-policy strategies. The country that gave the world the Truman Doctrine and the Reagan Doctrine as well as Trump’s apparent favorite, the Monroe Doctrine, now embraces the plainest and most ostentatiously bellicose of national-security policies: Fuck around and find out. Trump’s own Pentagon chief, the self-styled (until Congress approves the title change) secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, said as much when he told the nation that Maduro “effed around, and he found out.”

If the Fuck Around and Find Out Doctrine doesn’t sound like a concept for a stable and predictable foreign policy—one purpose of Washington’s doctrine-articulation complex—then maybe you can sympathize with those who Rubio says are still struggling to get it. Some experts reject the idea that something this crude even earns the right to be called a doctrine. As John Bolton, currently a Trump nemesis but once one of his first-term national security advisers, told us, “There is no Trump Doctrine: No matter what he does, there is no grand conceptual framework; it’s whatever suits him at the moment.” Kori Schake, the director of foreign- and defense-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, cautioned us that “we shouldn’t ennoble Trump policy by saying there’s a doctrine.”

In the early decades of the 20th century, “America First” was in part a euphemism for U.S. isolation from the ravages of war in Europe. Trump then revived the term, starting in 2016, when he promised to end America’s long post-9/11 conflicts, which cost taxpayers trillions and failed to deliver clear victories. Instead, he would prioritize domestic issues and the well-being of Americans. Yet there he was on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, vowing to “run Venezuela for the foreseeable future.” And if that involves a bit of nation building and American boots on the ground, well, so be it. Trump, it turns out, seems to believe that a little foreign adventurism is just fine, as long as he’s the one doing the adventuring. It was a departure from his previous instinct to limit his foreign interventions to short, kinetic bursts of force—an unofficial one-and-done doctrine—visible in his first-term strike on the Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and his more recent decision to dispatch U.S. bombers deep into Iran.

“Rebuilding is not a bad thing, in Venezuela’s case; the country has gone to hell,” Trump told our colleague Michael Scherer in an interview yesterday. But when asked why similar actions in Iraq were an abomination, the president punted. “That was Bush,” Trump said. “You’ll have to ask Bush that question, because we should have never gone into Iraq. That started the Middle East disaster.” (In a separate Atlantic interview last year, Trump said that “America First” is whatever he says it is: “Considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides that.”)

The White House quickly embraced the newly articulated doctrine, circulating after Saturday’s Mar-a-Lago press conference an image of a determined-looking Trump striding up steps, with the caption—you guessed it—“FAFO.” Another administration publicity push featured Rubio’s warning to foreign nations to not “play games with President Trump,” a politer version of the same idea. “The 47th president of the United States is not a game player,” Rubio said at Mar-a-Lago. “If you don’t know, now you know.” (It’s unclear if Rubio—a self-professed rap fan—was deliberately quoting the Notorious B.I.G., but the White House later posted a video set to the Biggie song.)

It should come as no surprise that Hegseth, with his penchant for scrapping on social media and dressing down generals for being fat, is practically tripping over himself to make FAFO happen. Asked Saturday about where the FAFO policy has applied, Hegseth cited Iran’s nuclear program, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the southern U.S. border. “There’s been a lot of politicians that want to talk. They want to talk peace. They want to talk diplomacy. They want to talk negotiations. They want to talk globalism and international organizations,” he told CBS News. “President Trump speaks through action.”

So far, Trump appears most willing to take a FAFO approach to the Western Hemisphere. One person close to Trump told us that the president has embraced a different set of criteria for responding to what he sees as irritants in the Americas—such as Maduro—than for those farther afield. “If this were happening in a different part of the globe, none of this would have taken place,” this person said on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. In other words, Trump views many parts of this hemisphere as a rightful extension of his U.S. sandbox, where he is free to snatch and grab what he pleases. (That glistening Venezuelan oil? The Panama Canal? Mine! That tantalizing slice of Greenland? Also mine!)

Trump told Scherer that Greenland had not been on his mind when he’d been ousting Maduro—but he then proceeded to offer real-time foreign-policy musings on that very topic, in one of his characteristic verbal weaves. “You know, I wasn’t referring to Greenland at that time, but we do need Greenland, absolutely,” Trump said. “And we need it for defense. You know, it’s surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships. We need Greenland.” (Katie Miller, the wife of the top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, posted an image on social media on Saturday of Greenland covered by an American flag, with the caption: “SOON.” And Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, urged Washington yesterday to end its threats, which she said make “absolutely no sense.”)

Kevin Whitaker, who served as U.S. ambassador to Colombia during the Obama and first Trump administrations, told us that the president’s “or else” approach to Venezuela is visible in Trump’s second-term blueprint for global statecraft. The idea behind Trump’s new National Security Strategy, Whitaker said, is that “we’re the hegemon in this hemisphere, and we can do whatever we want, including actions that are of questionable legitimacy.” The manifesto even cites a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, the early-19th-century policy that sought to block European colonial activity in the Americas.

Like his predecessors, however, the U.S. president isn’t just seeking to fend off transatlantic imperialists; he is also laying claim to the hemisphere’s strategic sites and resources. The Maduro ouster is a manifestation of Trump and his senior officials’ belief that powerful countries have the right to dominate their surrounding continents and oceans, an idea uncomfortably close to China’s hegemonic claim to the western Pacific and Russia’s imperial designs on Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union. And U.S. actions, in turn, are designed to signal to those rival powers to stay away. One U.S. official told us that he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been “scared shitless” by the U.S. grabbing Maduro because he knows “not to fuck with the U.S. military.”

Trump, at the Mar-a-Lago press conference on Saturday, blamed past presidents for fighting far-off wars while allowing leftist regimes in America’s vicinity to fester. He alleged that Venezuela has committed a host of offenses, including sending criminals to the United States en masse, running drugs, and stealing American oil. “All of these actions were in gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy dating back more than two centuries—not anymore,” Trump said. “The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot.”

Many Venezuelans, both at home and in the U.S., welcomed Maduro’s ouster after more than a decade of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression. Trump said at Mar-a-Lago that a group of senior officials, including Rubio and Hegseth, would be part of a group that would “run” Venezuela. But that’s about as far as the planning appears to have gone. On NBC News’s Meet the Press yesterday, when asked whether he and other senior officials were indeed running Venezuela, Rubio responded that U.S. officials were just “running policy” there. He also depicted the capture of Maduro as a law-enforcement operation to apprehend the president and his wife because they face charges in U.S. court. “We are not going to be able to allow in our hemisphere a country that becomes a crossroads for the activities of all of our adversaries around the world,” he said.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One yesterday evening, “This isn’t a country, like, we have to travel 24 hours in an airplane. This is Venezuela. This is our area: the Don-roe Doctrine.” He also managed, in just 37 minutes, to threaten or hint at military action against Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, Iran, Mexico, and Venezuela (again).

Even before he extracted Maduro, Trump was employing the instruments of U.S. power in new, radical, and contradictory ways across the Americas. His administration has threatened to strike cartels in Mexico over its government’s objections, pardoned a former Honduran president convicted in the U.S. on drug-trafficking offenses, and offered a $20 billion line of credit to Argentina.

“There’s example after example of where they treat the Americas differently than they treat involvement elsewhere,” Ricardo Zuniga, who served as a senior official for Latin America during the Biden administration, told us. “They have a very 19th-century view of the world, and they’re proud of that.” The United States’ historic penchant for heavy-handed involvement in Latin America has often had a perversely counterproductive effect, from Nicaragua and Cuba in the early 1900s to Chile in the 1970s: It has given rise to generations of nationalist leaders who railed against Yankee imperialism.

Read: Even close allies are asking why Trump wants to run Venezuela

There may be other limits on the FAFO doctrine. The person close to Trump said that the president still has no appetite for a prolonged occupation of a foreign nation. But he is more than willing to use the threat of such action as leverage over the country’s interim leaders. In Venezuela, that is Maduro’s second-in-command, Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as interim president on Saturday. Trump has made clear that there is an “or else” hanging over her head: a second wave of military action should she not comply with U.S. demands. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told Scherer yesterday.

It is all, this person said, part of the plan. “Most presidents would not go out and say, ‘I’m not afraid to put boots on the ground,’ because their base would go, ‘Wait a minute,’” the person told us. “But Trump is willing to be misunderstood in the short term to get what he wants.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As bombs landed on Caracas early Saturday morning, friends and family members told me that their houses seemed to shake. The city is in a valley, so nearly every building has a view—on this January morning, of fires dotting the hills and little, loud aircraft flying in all directions, like a mosquito swarm on a hot night.

Venezuelans have been through a lot in recent decades: the rise of Hugo Chávez, a ruinous revolution that turned democracy into dictatorship, an economic crisis that became a humanitarian one, the emigration of more than one in four inhabitants. Many people are by now familiar with the smell of tear gas and the sound of gunshots. But the sensory experience of bombs falling from the sky was for the most part novel. The Trump administration hit military bases mainly in or near Caracas; at least seven explosions killed dozens of people.

Many Venezuelans welcomed the strikes. Before Saturday, polls showed that a majority of Venezuelans both inside and outside the country favored U.S. military intervention. María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition movement, issued a statement following the American operation: “Venezuelans, the hour of freedom has arrived!” she said, adding, “Let’s remain vigilant, active, and organized, until the Democratic Transition is fulfilled.”

The simplest reason for celebration is that Nicolás Maduro is out. The dictator who imprisoned and tortured Venezuelan politicians, activists, and ordinary people was snatched from his bed and put on an American plane with his wife, Cilia Flores. Photos of him under arrest have already brought catharsis to millions. But there are reasons to be wary too. The dubious legality and shifting rationales behind Donald Trump’s actions raise questions about the administration’s intentions. The New York Times reported last month that some officials have sought a pretext to invoke emergency powers to deport Venezuelans from the United States. And Trump has given no indication of caring about the legitimacy of the regime that will follow Maduro’s.

Machado appears unbothered by these concerns. She has long been close to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and their friendship may well have influenced the administration’s Venezuela policy. Months before the first Caribbean strike—and before the administration singled out Venezuela as a drug threat—Machado told me that she hoped to see a “big anti-narcotics operation in the Caribbean.” In the spring, she hosted a press conference where she framed the fall of Maduro as “A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity” for American investors. She said that post-Maduro Venezuela would welcome American oil companies—an invitation that Trump officials appear to be seizing on. When she won the Nobel Peace Prize in October, she dedicated her award to Trump.

The Trump administration has done exactly what Machado asked of it, but Trump spoke of her dismissively in his press conference on Saturday. It’s not clear whether she will have much of a role in shaping Venezuela’s future. “She is a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have respect within the country,” Trump told a reporter, without so much as naming her. Instead, power will be shared between the American government and Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, at least for the time being. Machado seems to have lost control of the operation she helped set in motion.

Venezuela’s opposition wasn’t always so sanguine about foreign military intervention. Its leaders and activists have tried and failed to bring down the dictatorship by many other means in the nearly 13 years since Maduro succeeded the far more charismatic Chávez as Venezuela’s strongman. Protests erupted across the country in 2014 and again in 2017; Maduro sent tanks into the streets, arrested dissidents, and waited for the heat to subside. In 2019, opposition leaders persuaded the first Trump administration to recognize the politician Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Dozens of countries followed suit. Maduro ramped up repression and did what he does best—waited things out.

During the 2019 debacle, opposition leaders debated what exactly they wanted the United States to do if Maduro refused to relinquish power. Guaidó was himself ambivalent. “If the Americans would propose a military intervention, I would probably accept,” he told an Italian newspaper. Even then, Machado was more decisive. “I want to be very precise,” she told the BBC in 2019. “Maduro will only leave power when he’s faced with a credible, imminent, and severe threat of the use of force.”

Leopoldo López, an opposition leader who spent many years in prison and is now in exile, told me in 2024 that he and Machado were always seen as “more radical” than others in the movement. At a time when some activists worried that calling Venezuelans to demonstrate would only put them at risk, López and Machado favored mass protests.

Machado ran for president against Maduro in 2024, after securing more than 90 percent of the vote in the opposition primary. Maduro barred her candidacy, perhaps calculating that no substitute would accrue the same gravitas. In fact, the substitute Machado chose, Edmundo González, beat Maduro 2–1. And Machado had the tally sheets to prove it, because she’d coordinated volunteer election watchers all over the country. International bodies certified Machado’s counts. World leaders applauded her remarkable victory. Still, Maduro hung on to power.

The electoral fraud left the opposition dejected. “Everything that I always dreamt would happen happened,” Roberto Patiño, an opposition activist, told me in the fall. “We won; presidents backed us; Maduro was offered an exit path. I really thought, This has to work!”

“Maduro is a cockroach,” Ana Milagros Parra, a 28-year-old activist, told me. “He always survives.”

Parra fled Caracas for Bogotá after the election. Then two of her friends nearly died there in what Colombian authorities said might have been an assassination attempt ordered by Caracas, and she fled Bogotá for Buenos Aires. Now she’s a social-media influencer. She told me that she doesn’t like Trump and thought that his justifications for striking boats were bogus, because Venezuela is not a major player in drug trafficking. But, she said, the opposition couldn’t “afford the luxury” of letting this opportunity slide.

I heard a similar line of argument from another opposition influencer, Germania Rodriguez, a freelance journalist. “Listen, what’s going on here is, beggars can’t be choosers,” Rodriguez told me. “And no one but Trump has taken an interest in our crisis.”

One could easily imagine that the fires around Caracas, and the belittling remarks of the U.S. president, would lead those who’d supported the strikes to reconsider their views. But that’s not what I’ve observed. Figures who have long backed the opposition are praising the attacks as a success.

“The operation against Nicolás Maduro is not just any military operation,” Ivan Duque, a former president of Colombia and a longtime friend of Machado’s, told me. “It is a humanitarian operation, because it was about freeing Venezuela from a satrap, a tyrant, a dictator.”

Duque had watched the press conference in which Trump dismissed Machado, but he wasn’t too worried. After all, it was a spontaneous comment, possibly off-script. Duque expressed confidence that Trump was ultimately a “democrat” despite what others might claim about his authoritarian inclinations: “In politics, there are different styles,” he said. “But beyond style, what matters to me are results.”

Genesis Davila, a Venezuelan human-rights lawyer based in Washington, D.C., told me that she had “no reservations” about the way the strikes were carried out. As the founder of a nonprofit called Defiende Venezuela, Davila has worked to hold Maduro accountable under international law. For years, she has documented extrajudicial killings, persecutions, arbitrary detentions, and torture. “What mechanisms were international law and the human-rights system offering to stop Maduro?” she said. “More reports? More condemnations?”

Not even people on Machado’s team seem to have been discouraged by Trump’s contemptuous remarks. “María Corina Machado’s force is not something that emanates from Trump’s finger,” Milos Alcalay, a career diplomat who advises Machado on international politics, told me; it comes “from the support that Venezuelans have given to her.” Trump’s claim that the United States would “run” Venezuela was “absurd,” Alcalay conceded. But he suggested that the president couldn’t possibly have meant it, that he was just exerting pressure.

I asked him this: What if Trump has just claimed Maduro as a trophy, and nothing else changes in Venezuela?

“I’ve thought about it,” Alcalay said. “But I don’t think that’ll be the case.”

For the moment, however, regime change is far from guaranteed. Political prisoners remain imprisoned. Maduro’s vice president is now interim president and seems keen on preserving the status quo: “In Venezuela, there is only one president,” she said on Saturday in a televised address. “His name is Nicolás Maduro.” Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino, two of Maduro’s most important ministers, have made a point of speaking publicly many times over the weekend.

Maduro is now at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City. His first court appearance could come as soon as today, on counts of “narco-terrorism conspiracy,” “cocaine importation conspiracy,” and weapons offenses—charges that are at once extremely serious and grossly mismatched to the enormity of his record.

Venezuela’s opposition, meanwhile, remains in limbo. Will it pay a price for courting a war based on lies? Right now, those I’ve contacted are ebullient, and the movement seems united in the faith that whatever comes next for Venezuela cannot be as bad as what it has endured under Maduro.</div>

            <h2>A Horseshoe Theory of Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/libertarian-authoritarianism-trump-economics/685426/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After the inauguration of Andrew Jackson, in 1829, thousands of his supporters poured into the White House to celebrate. The crowd overwhelmed the staff and trashed some of the furniture before the party was relocated to the White House lawn. The episode earned Jackson the nickname “King Mob” and became a symbol of his man-of-the-people persona.

Donald Trump is often compared to Jackson, but the events he has hosted since his second inauguration carry a different sort of symbolism. In May, he held a dinner at one of his golf courses for the 220 people who had spent the most money—$148 million, collectively—to buy his $TRUMP crypto meme coin. In October, he hosted a White House dinner for the rich individuals and corporate executives who had donated to his White House–ballroom project.

For the past decade, Trump has supposedly been on the verge of breaking from the laissez-faire economics of the Reagan GOP—otherwise known as neoliberalism—in favor of pro-worker populism. And in some ways, he really has succeeded in casting out the ghosts of Reaganomics by embracing hands-on market interventions. The New York Times business reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin has called Trumponomics a form of “state-sponsored capitalism.” A recent essay by Scott Lincicome, the vice president of general economics at the libertarian Cato Institute, calls 2025 “the year America went (kinda) socialist,” and describes Trump’s approach as “state corporatism.”

What these accounts leave out is the fact that Trump has simultaneously steered economic policy in an even more pro-business direction than his Republican predecessors, including his own first-term administration. When they aren’t personally being shaken down by the president, corporations and billionaires are being left to do as they please in pursuit of profit. Greed has never been this good.

Derek Thompson: The era of step-on-a-rake capitalism

The result is a strange contradiction that the term socialism doesn’t begin to capture. Trump’s economic management combines two theoretically incompatible tendencies. It is at once libertarian, because the state is doing less to protect consumers and workers, and authoritarian, because the government sometimes lawlessly interrupts the workings of the free market in service of the personal and ideological interests of Trump and his allies. This makes MAGA economics a seemingly impossible hybrid: libertarian authoritarianism.

One might have expected Trump’s first term to have put to rest any dreams of a pro-worker GOP policy revolution. With rare exceptions, his economic agenda catered to the super-wealthy, corporate America, and anti-government activists. He passed an enormous tax cut that disproportionately favored corporations and rich individuals. His National Labor Relations Board took positions favored by employers, narrowed workers’ ability to organize, and rolled back a rule expanding eligibility for overtime pay.

Some supporters still insisted that Trump had the common man’s interests at heart. They had an explanation for the disappointments of his first term: Trump had been surrounded by traditional Republican staffers who carried water for Big Business and sabotaged any effort to break from neoliberalism. The likes of Steve Mnuchin weren’t true MAGA. Once Trump had a team of loyal soldiers around him, everything would be different. “We’re done catering to Wall Street,” J. D. Vance declared at the 2024 Republican National Convention.

We now have a year’s worth of data by which to judge the accuracy of such predictions. No one can deny that Trump is doing what he wants, and what he wants is slashing clean-air regulations, rolling back consumer protections (such as a rule requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled flights), shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, extending corporate tax cuts, attempting to ban state-level AI regulation, pardoning financial scammers, letting the crypto industry run wild (while Trump himself gets in on the action), allowing betting companies to brazenly flout state-level gambling bans, and so on. The NLRB as of this writing doesn’t even have a single member. Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, recently argued on cable news that the regulations imposed on the banking sector after the 2008 financial crisis were too strict and must be rolled back. Stacks of earnest pro-worker policy proposals from “New Right” think tanks sit untouched.

What makes things confusing is that Trump is breaking from neoliberalism in many ways—they just have very little to do with economic policy per se, and much more to do with increasing Trump’s personal power. Antitrust is one domain where progressive Democrats and MAGA diehards have found common ground. But under Trump 2.0, enforcement is down (libertarianism) even as the administration seems to steer corporate consolidation in Trump’s favor (authoritarianism). The Federal Communications Commission, for example, didn’t approve Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount until after CBS News, a Paramount subsidiary, agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential-library fund to settle a personal lawsuit filed by the president. Skydance also committed in writing to various ideological reforms, including appointing an anti-bias ombudsman at the network. More recently, referring to Skydance’s effort to outbid Netflix to acquire Warner Bros., Trump told reporters, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”

Meanwhile, Trump’s Federal Trade Commission has abandoned its defense of a Biden-era rule banning employers from using noncompete clauses, a practice that research has shown suppresses worker wages. At the DOJ, two top antitrust officials were fired after protesting the department’s decision to allow Hewlett Packard Enterprise to acquire one of its biggest competitors. One of those officials, Roger Alford, later gave a speech in which he suggested that America was being governed not by the rule of law but by “the rule of lobbyists”—a nod to accusations that the deal had been pushed through because the parties had paid the right MAGA influencers to push for it.

Another post-neoliberal innovation by Trump 2.0 is the extraction of tribute payments from corporations with business before the government. Trump has required companies including Intel, U.S. Steel, and Nvidia to give the federal government various degrees of ownership stakes in their business, and more such deals are expected. As Lincicome, the Cato vice president, points out, no one has offered any strategic rationale for doing so. “We should take stakes in companies when people need something,” Trump has said. If this is socialism, it is socialism without a proletariat, central planning without a plan.

Even Trump’s massive global tariffs have almost no logical connection to the major critiques of free trade—or, as far as anyone can tell, to any consistent policy objective at all beyond allowing Trump to alpha-dog America’s trading partners. Experts from across the political spectrum have argued that carefully targeted tariffs can bolster key domestic industries, particularly manufacturing, and protect the subset of workers whose jobs are most threatened by cheap imports. Trump instead chose to impose indiscriminate tariffs on almost every country on Earth, for almost every category of import. Economists warned that this approach would hurt domestic manufacturing by raising the price of raw materials. They appear to have been right: Employment in the manufacturing sector has trended down ever since “Liberation Day.”

The counterargument that Trump’s economic-populist defenders fall back on is that the president has kept his pledge to America’s common man where it matters most: immigration. They argue that illegal immigration suppresses wages and job opportunities for native-born workers. Trump’s crackdown is thus a huge blow struck in favor of the American working class, and against corporate overlords who prefer to have a steady supply of cheap labor.

As my colleague Rogé Karma explained last year, however, essentially the entire weight of empirical economic evidence suggests that this theory has never been true in practice. (Immigrants don’t just increase the labor supply; they also increase demand for labor, because they consume goods and services.) And indeed, according to the most recent federal jobs report, the unemployment rate rose from 4.0 percent in January to 4.6 percent in November—the highest jobless rate since September 2021—and was higher year-over-year for native-born workers specifically.

Even if the theory were correct, that wouldn’t explain Trump’s actual policies. Detaining a Turkish graduate student who criticizes Israel does not open up any jobs for native-born construction workers. Neither does shutting down citizenship proceedings for lawful immigrants from 19 countries or restricting the asylum program mostly to white South Africans. Trump’s immigration policies don’t make sense as a pro-worker agenda, but do make sense as a way of silencing dissent and keeping out nonwhite immigrants.

The idea that Trump’s immigration policy is designed to help the American worker would be easier to take seriously were he not simultaneously giving every possible concession to the industry most likely to cause mass job loss in the near future. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 71 percent of Americans said they worried about AI “putting too many people out of work permanently.” Yet the Trump administration, with its close ties to Silicon Valley centibillionaires, is assiduously removing any obstacles to the growth of the AI sector. After Congress failed to include a moratorium on state-level AI regulation in a spending bill, Trump issued an executive order directing the DOJ to sue states that dare to pass laws protecting their citizens from the technology.

Authoritarianism and libertarianism are commonly thought of as opposites—two poles on a political spectrum. It is a sign of Trump’s distinctive political genius that he has managed to combine the two concepts. By tearing down generally applicable restraints on corporate behavior while selectively exerting direct influence to reward his allies and punish his critics, he has managed to preserve all the flaws of the old Republican economic approach while introducing new ones that are even worse.</div>

People can be enrolling even though they don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it because they don&#39;t know what else to do.

It&#39;s copied from The Atlantic, and right away, the opinion author&#39;s assertions run into trouble.

&quot;For the overwhelming majority of graduates, the returns on going to college more than offset the cost of tuition. &quot;. That&#39;s news to all the grads drowning in debt they&#39;ll never pay off.

&quot;After factoring in financial aid, the cost of attending a public four-year college has fallen by more than 20 percent since 2015, even before adjusting for inflation.&quot; What? Seriously?

Many more things like that. And she never even addresses the issue of enrollment now being overwhelmingly female, with majors that are money losers in the job markets. Nor does she address the fact that a growing number of students are foreign, sent here by their families or governments to gain technical and business knowledge to take back home after graduation. The whole thing reads like a PR piece for colleges.

The point about foreign students is a good one.  Colleges can be granting more degrees in total, but still have falling domestic enrollment.

That&#39;s news to all the grads drowning in debt they&#39;ll never pay off.

It&#39;s talking about an average. Some loan takers fall through the cracks, usually because either they cannot find a job that takes advantage of their degree, and/or because they took on an unrealistic amount of debt. Often one&#39;s ego writes checks the Bank of Reality can&#39;t cover.

the issue of enrollment now being overwhelmingly female, with majors that are money losers in the job markets.

Ignoring that this comes across misogynistic, many wome

&quot;Should a person go to college for a non-viable degree? Maybe they will pay but not get a job using that degree.&quot;

I think this is one of the true failings of our current education system. And it&#39;s across the board, across many ages. Who is tracking the usefulness / applicability of classes taken and skills taught?

In High School in the US, we give diplomas to kids who were made to take geometry and algebra, but who don&#39;t understand how a loan works.In college in the US, we give diplomas to kids who were made

The &quot;evidence&quot; that the article cites that the turn away from higher education is false is as follows:

1.  More people are getting degrees over time2.  The amount people pay is less

I actually look at it this way:  People who can afford to pay full freight now refuse to pay because the perceived value is less, so to make up the difference in enrollment, they have to discount the price to attract more people to enroll.  There&#39;s also the possibility that the rigor necessary to get a degree has been reduced, in

            <div id="article-text">There is a significant difference between the O-1B visa and the EB-1 visa Melania came to the US with. O-1B is non-immigrant and temporary and requires a sponsor,  EB-1 is permanent/immigrant and is a much higher level of skill to achieve. This is not to say she met that level of importance but the two visa&#39;s are not the same.

Melania has incredible oral skills, methinks.

There are some women (and girls) who are smuggled into the country and have their documents/passports seized, living as sex slaves.  They don&#39;t get visas.  Much of that trafficking has been shut down.

I feel like they left this one out of Idiocracy, but it would have fit the theme perfectly.

... a country which has devolved into being one big grift is welcoming an influx of grifters from other countries.

Like attracts like; besides, everyone with no moral centre wants to be inside, rather than outside, the country which is poised to launch World War 3.

I was watching a Twitch stream where Pokimane was addressing her recent visa renewal and some issues travelling back to the US, and she nailed it perfectly. The O1 visa is based upon how much money the US thinks you can make, and they can therefore tax. It&#39;s not about artistry or anything like that in the majority of cases, they just want to see you will make money they can collect taxes on. Like most things in the government (especially in this government) it has become entirely transactional.

I mean what&#39;s the issue with that exactly? It&#39;d be one thing if it were something illegal but if you have a career, any career, where someone is making hundreds of thousands or millions why wouldn&#39;t we want them in the US if they want to move here? Anything else feels like a moral judgement and that&#39;s also not a good way to handle this type of thing.

Missed the joke. Was it yours or the AC&#39;s? Don&#39;t see how it could have been the vacuous Subject. Perhaps you care to explain?

My original reaction to the story was to wonder about the relationship of &quot;plagiarism&quot; to &quot;dubious character&quot;. There are various reasons for and definitions of plagiarism. I can actually see where a lack of originality might be a good thing for most of the people in the civil service. Most of them are supposed to be following the laws and rules as written and too much creativity can e

Hey, I get that the country is really polarized right now but your vitriol againsy fellow Americans isn&#39;t helping things.

Might be a good idea to disconnect for a while, really take a look at how media influences your biases. We&#39;re all nerds here, and this brand of hate is doing a lot of harm.

All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.

Indeed. It also attracts malicious people because with a badge or the like they can mistreat others without punishment.

Power also corrupts.  So in those rare cases where virtuous people wind up with any amount of power at all, they do not remain virtuous for very long.

But what you said is still true: the already evil (or, as they prefer to think of it, already enlightened) are the ones who most aggressively seek positions of power (and who have the most advantages for attaining it, since they have no problems playing dirty to win).

Not all &quot;rich&quot; people got rich by cheating.

But when people who work hard all their lives, and achieve modest, barely-there success see people who skate and fake-it-&#39;til-they-make-it raking in dough hand over fist, and holding positions of power... ...it makes even the most saintly of law-abiding citizens bite their tongue and grin n&#39; bear it, instead of skinning the motherfuckers alive in the town square.

I hope this sentiment plays a large role in our next election.  Or our next civil war, whichever comes first.

Adjacent to that is this article: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/0... [nytimes.com]

The study found that the Supreme Court has become deeply polarized in cases pitting the rich against the poor, with Republican appointees far more likely than Democratic ones to side with the wealthy. That is starkly different from the middle of the last century, when appointees of the two parties were statistically indistinguishable on this measure.

There may be something of interest in the findings, but in regards to the nature of cases being heard, not the relative finances of the claimants.

&quot;Not all &quot;rich&quot; people got rich by cheating.&quot;

Because &quot;cheating&quot; is the wrong metric.  All &quot;rich&quot; people &quot;got rich&quot; by exploiting, or by inheriting wealth obtained through exploitation.

Who said every great fortune is based on a great crime?

However, I actually think there are (at least) two ways to get rich. Yes, crime, but also major luck. Someone had to win the lottery, even if it is just the lottery of being born in a rich family.

New problem is that in recent years it has become increasingly popular to &quot;fix&quot; the crime (and post facto legitimize the fortune) by bribing the cheapest politicians to revise the laws to legalize the crime. Not completely new, but much more brazen about it tha

Not a great fortune. But large enough that I still suspect crime at the corporate level... Care to offer any details about what your company did to pay the CTO so well? Also curious why you were in such a hurry to retire.

(Not that I should complain. As things turned out, I certainly could have worked for another 10 years, but I was actually surprised by how smoothly I was able to shift my lifestyle. Work was the center for so many years...)

Luck/Good Fortune and a dose of hard work and focus are more important in my experience.  Of course being good at managing your money is pretty important as well.

Sure, some people inherit money, but history says at least half squander the money away within two generations.

exploiting the labor of others is very scalable.

Is being a president a &quot;public service&quot; ?   What about Secretary of War? Attorney General?  FBI chief?

China&#39;s government is famously corrupt, so it&#39;s no surprise that it attracts the already corrupt.

&quot;China&#39;s government is famously corrupt, so it&#39;s no surprise that it attracts the already corrupt&quot;I don&#39;t disagree but the USA&#39;s often seems to be almost as bad

The only ones in public service are those who&#39;ve climbed up the ranks of the government.

I’m honestly curious. What’s your definition of a “king”? The No Kings organizers, as well as other “progressive” aligned organizers, literally within hours, and without the slightest bit of self reflection, organized nationwide protests, with identical signage, AGAINST the deposition of Maduro - they demand his reinstatement. Yet Maduro undeniably subverted elections, shot hundreds if not  thousands of his opponents, stole billions

One hesitates to believe this argument is at all applicable to my question.

Your argument, likely not coincidentally, “forgets” the entire context: those same domestic laws and international treaties about sovereignty quite obviously have built in carve outs for deposing dictators that destabilize a region.

The Barbary pirates, Hitler, and Qaddafi come to mind. Plus the Venezuelan’s themselves appear to be broadly quite happy with the situation, which satisfies egalitarian enlightenment mora

Look, corruption is one of the most cultural specific activities.  It is tremendously affected by the morals values taught to people.  It is possible to teach people to be more ethical or less so, particularly with regards to which type of behavior is &#39;the worst&#39;.   You can teach people that murder and rape are evil and should be dealt with by execution, while theft is not so bad and gets a slap on the wrist.  Or you can do it the other way around.

In addition, it is effected by the economic structure tremendously affects WHERE the criminals are.  If you have a capitalist society the money focused criminals are going to go into private business.  If you have a communist society, the money focused criminals will go into government.

So it is not surprising to me that Chinese plagiarists are going into government.

This does not necessarily apply to other cultures.

So it is not surprising to me that Chinese plagiarists are going into government.indeed. in other cultures it might be warmongers, outright criminals and genocidal sociopaths like in the us and israel. and rotten total dumbfucks like in europe.

on a more serious note, china seems still to be a meritocracy, even if part of that merit is the politiclal skill to meddle and thrive (quite universal). the west is more and more afflicted by nepotism and a detached ruling class. i would see that just as inherent traits of decadent and emerging societies respectively more than an ideological (cultural) thing.

i don&#39;t really know what to make of those points. sounds like dumbfuck ideology used to fill the void of actual serious political discourse. nothing n

that&#39;s a decent comment in your universe, i assume.

btw, just for the fun, what &quot;news site&quot; would you suggest?

I think it was Margaret Mead who warned about the issues of taking observations from one culture and applying them to a different one.

And, this being Hong Kong, you&#39;ve got significant added political implications. Given the current political climate there, I could easily see where toadies might be far more likely to enter government service there right now. Unfortunately the article is paywalled, so I don&#39;t know what time period is covered by these observations. Was it pre-crackdown? Post? A mix of the two? Those would be important bits of data to have when trying to unravel this.

More importantly, it directly supports the allegations that China&#39;s government is very corrupt.  I don&#39;t know if they also tested for agreeability, which would identify &quot;toadies&quot;.

That&#39;s true. In a western, democratic capitalist society, the sociopaths end up running for office and very successfully tricking the normal people into voting for them, probably because normal people want no part of the toxicity that surrounds the halls of power. The civil service seems to, at least until recently, attract fairly honest, altruistic people who want to serve their country and fellow citizens.

“The President in particular is very much a figurehead — he wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had — he has already spent two of his ten presidential years in prison for fraud.”

- Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy

No one gets a job with the government because they like hard work.

I suspect it&#39;s actually a lot higher in the higher levels of management:  &quot;In a study published by the journal Psychology, Crime and Law, Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon tested 39 senior managers and chief executives from leading British businesses(3). They compared the results to the same tests on patients at Broadmoor special hospital, where people who have been convicted of serious crimes are incarcerated. On certain indicators of psychopathy, the bossesâ(TM)s scores either matched or exceeded thos

I can provide anecdotal support for these findings.

Most of the career-successful people I worked with/under were bull-shitters who were good at social networking but frequently marginally competent at best.  Supervisor level and upwards, this was disappointingly common.  Some long term people felt safe and entrenched by the end of their careers and dropped the social networking for open rivalries.

There was an additional population of people whose sole goal was the public sector salary, job stability, and eventual pension.  They tended to be lazy and/or incompetent.  Occasionally they couldn&#39;t hold on and would burn out badly enough to lose their employment.

Finally, there was a third category of those who believed in public service (but were quite pleased with the salary, stability, and pension).

I&#39;m not in China, but I would expect this to be a typical outcome anywhere the public service pay is attractive.

I assume this makes them worse public servants, but is there direct evidence of that.

I&#39;m not sure I would want a president that was 100% rule bound, I don&#39;t think that applies to the DMV though

The upper echelons of the corporate world and finance also attract sociopaths. But as private actors they can&#39;t force people to buy their products of give them money at the point of a gun the way governments can.

Government and its sort-of monopoly on violence being a necessary evil, we limit its power, divide its authority, and structure our society so that government is not in series with essentials like food and housing.

And organizational psychology tells us that narcissism, not competence, is often the strongest predictor of who emerges as a leader in unstructured groups.  Groups led by a narcissist do not perform better-- they just think they do. This happens all the time in business,

In his book, the actual leader of the universe turned out to be oblivious to it. His thinking was that anybody who aspires to the role should under no circumstances be permitted to have it.

I&#39;ve been saying for a decade or more that the altruistic public servant is an extinct species, and people entering politics now should immediately be suspect. It attracts poor quality people.

This question has already been answered.  Learn how to use the search.

That is the biggest problem with all the user forums and answer sites.  The most common answer is &quot;Why do you even want to do that?  You should be doing something else entirely,&quot; assuming that the person asking is a moron and couldn&#39;t possibly have any valid reason for wanting or needing to do what he is asking.

I attempted to answer some questions in which I happened to have some domain knowledge, but didn&#39;t have the time or the inclination to meet their requirements.

Did you even stop to consider that your (only) answer might have been wrong?We don&#39;t vote on an answer being better or worse than others: we vote on their objective accuracy.

That&#39;s the problem with blind moderation. How is he to know. Contributing is more meaningful than moderating. The value is in the discussion and information exchange, not in the number.

I actually think Slashdot has this backwards. Moderation is undone by posting. I think posting is an essential part of moderation.

They&#39;re worse than Wikipedia because if someone has some information to add to a Wikipedia article which doesn&#39;t have some demon editor squatting atop it like the throne of Nyarlathotep, they can just go ahead and add it right away without having to ask anyone or jump through any stupid hoops.

I&#39;m not going to lurk and troll their stupid shitty slow site in order to find stuff that I can meet their points requirement with.

concur. there was some good information there, but asking and answering was a really onerous process to figure out, and i never did quite get the hang of answer vs. comment.

Kind of an idle question, but I wonder if Spolsky saw it coming or got lucky.

Why not allow everything and let users do their own filtering?

The purpose is to provide correct answers.

This is the answer to the question &quot;Why was Stack Overflow more successful than forum posts?&quot;

People have limited patience to find answers, a curated knowledge repository is more valuable than other uncurated options.

This is both reason for success of SO and the cause for being the perpetual punching bag. Since there was a high amount of moderation the answers were way better than sorting through forum posts. But people care about their question being answered and don&#39;t care that the added volume of duplicates makes the site less searchable for others. And for people answering getting moderated for &quot;good enough&quot; answers is often a stronger deterrent to contribution than fake internet points and altruism is an incentive.

I have a nonzero reputation  [stackoverflow.com] on Stack Overflow, but I haven&#39;t written an Answer since May 2024 and the last of my Answers that has more than one upvote is from 2020.  I for one hope it does weather the storm, but the high bar to making a &quot;good&quot; contribution is a challenge.

And the comparison to Wikipedia is apt in some ways; but Wikipedia also has a lot of content on history, politics, and religion, and in the past had (perhaps still has) some editors who wanted to make sure certain modern social causes were

Whatâ(TM)s even more puzzling to me is the level of incompetence of their leadership. People have been complaining loudly about what a miserable experience SO was to use for over a decade and company leadership was happy to sit back and do nothing about it. They absolutely deserve what theyâ(TM)re getting.

Atwood and Spolsky cashing out at the top got incredibly lucky given what a terrible job they did running the site.

Worse than Wikipedia, because anyone can post to Wikipedia, even if it&#39;s reverted 5 minutes later.  Not on these sites -- you need brownie points first.

I used to give free IT Support in yahoo chat groups in the 1998-2003 era.  People stopped asking for help in those html-based real-time chat forums sometime around when Stack Overflow was getting started.

I think this news is just evolution that has no &quot;right or wrong&quot;, only &quot;kill or be killed, eat or be eaten&quot;.

My concern is that the replacement really isn&#39;t sustainable. ChatGPT is not going to get better, the concept is ultimately technically limited to the level of reliability we see today, and without people publishing answers to more current questions, it&#39;s going to get stale and lose its usefulness pretty quickly.

I still find it hard to understand why that&#39;s so difficult for generative AI boosters to grasp. How will it be more accurate in 2035 if most of the information it bases its output on comes from 2025?

And if, like some, you&#39;re all going to pretend that people will still post anything but political rants and other non-technical stuff to the Internet in 2035, explain why StackOverflow is dead.

Congrats Altman, Nadella, Musk, and Pichai - we had a good thing going, you killed it. Assholes.

Also, where will AI gain new knowledge after authors & content-generators stop creating &quot;novel&quot; content, and stop applying the real intelligence that feeds the artificial one?

That is the question few ask (and fewer try to answer).  Even if human authors continue to publish new content, it is increasingly diluted by all the AI generated content out there (which becomes the training data for future versions of the AI models; rinse & repeat).  Unless new AI models use a totally different way of obtaining/generating training data, they will never be any smarter than they are right now (and will likely get dumber).

Man I long for the usenet of yore. Reddit is as good as it gets, and it is sometimes an adequate replacement.

Incidentally, AI *could* be awesome for technical questions if there were decent documentation out there for systems (plus source code for software systems) and the LLM had access to it.

And yet the number of GitHub projects that don&#39;t even mention their *purpose*, let alone proper documentation, boggles my mind

I recall using Experts Exchange before Stack Overflow became a thing.

And by &quot;using&quot; Experts Exchange, I mean a link to a post on their site would come up when I would search for something online. The answer was ostensibly paywalled, but all you had to do was view source and the answer was right there, buried in the HTML. You just had to search the document source for &quot;accepted answer&quot; or whatever

If you keep asking, will the LLM keep trying to get it right, until it does?

For complex issues I&#39;ve found it to start circling the drain.

First answer, obviously wrong. I reply that doesn&#39;t seem correct, are you sure. LLM replies with kiss ups and says I&#39;m so smart for checking and it&#39;s obviously wrong this is the correct answer.

Second answer looks self consistent and seems to solve the case. But after going moving forward with it see that it&#39;s an algorithm extremely fragile to edge cases that causes it to blow up. Point out the cases and instead of fixing the core issues it comes u

From my experience, I mostly find answers in several year old postings and even that not consistently enough. There is also a lot of bad answers. Not that LLM answers are any better. There is quite a bit of slop produced both by humans and machines.

...now that stackoverflow and other types of forums are soon to be gone?  I  think at one point in the future, when answers to questions cannot be found online, AI will not be able to find a solution.

I see a corollary where corporations enact mass layoffs in name of profits and efficiency, only to wonder why their customers no longer have the disposable income to buy their products.

Recall  Henry Ford was just about the only CEO who went the other way.  He dropped the price and gave his workers significant raises so they could afford to buy the product he was selling.

Then some assholes in SCOTUS handed the keys to the Dodge Brothers.

Ford did not give a raise to employees so that could afford to buy cars. He gave them a raise because work was hard and often boring; turnover was high (over 200% IIRC). It&#39;s better for Ford if they are not constantly training new employees. Even with the assembly line, high turnover was quite expensive..

Oh well, I guess we&#39;re back to sending all our questions to Expert Sex Change.

I had a similar issue here. Another problem is that I found was the notion of the &quot;accepted&quot; answer. This is great in theory, but only works as a snapshot in time because languages evolve. There was no simple way to post the same question again, or pin the &quot;accepted&quot; answer to a language or software package version.

I often went down the path of implementation suggested only to find that the problem was solved in a more modern way after a version update. The community just couldn&#39;t keep up with the evolution

Oh yes, the good old &quot;why do you want to do that&quot; reply, so you explain why you want to do that only to be told by someone else that you&#39;ll be better off buy a new PC or Reinstall the OS or something completely different, in the end you end up going elsewhere like Reddit etc and getting told how to do what you want to do - Great!!!

Now, it&#39;s just ask on of the suitable AI chatbots and you get your answer right back along with 99% working code

While I am not &quot;vibe&quot; coder I find myself increasingly using AI to get questions to answers that I used to post on SO, and getting pretty good results.  Asking a question on StackOverflow has always been a last resort, because that is the way they want it.  There is often as much energy expended on why a question shouldn&#39;t be answered as opposed to answering it.  The mechanisms to search for an existing answer are not good enough to keep you from DEITY FORBID posting a duplicate.  Also, the site is not good at dealing with stale content.  The &quot;accepted&quot; answer is often no longer the currently correct answer.   The level of snark and condescension is significant, and while I don&#39;t mind a bit of sarcasm now and then, I don&#39;t want to get in continual debates with someone on whether what I&#39;m trying to do is worth doing.

Contrast the experience with AI tools.  They do not yell at me for asking a question that could have been found via web search.  I do not have to wait, I get an immediate answer.  Yes, these tools are overly sycophantic, and sometimes they are wrong.  But 90% of the time I will get a workable response and I can choose to have my code updated based upon the answer.  In those cases where I  don&#39;t get a workable result, I either post an issue on the repo (open source) or contact the vendor (closed), which isn&#39;t all that different from what I do with SO

Peer-based discussion are useful, and if sites like Stack Overflow disappear, we&#39;ve lost something.  SO can perhaps remain relevant by being better at facilitating deeper design and architecture discussions and leave the simple &quot;how do I&quot; questions to AI.

It was just a majority of low-skilled people asking simple questions and a minority of moderately knowledgeable people trying to make themselves look like gurus by answering simple questions. Real experts were few and far between.

At best, it was a source of inspiration as to what might be wrong with your code. You still had to take that inspiration and write the code yourself if you wanted anything good since most answers were either irrelevant, incorrect or highly specific to someone&#39;s use case.

i gave up on the site pretty quickly as most of the “answers” were either non-answers or attitude.

IDK,i bumped in to the occasional overly-rigid process hiccup at SO but by and large i found it to be a tremendously effective tool, both for asking and answering Qs. imo, the last fifteen years or so of software development owe an awful lot to SO.   the rigid rules people are complaining about here (eg closing questions as dupes) definitely contributed to SO&#39;s effectiveness.

that said, i&#39;m using past-tense for SO. as much as i owe SO, the many AI helpers are easier and usually better.

it does beg the obvious question of how the AIs are going to get training material for future technologies.

I&#39;m sure your post would be deleted on SO for lack of capital letters.

The &quot;monthly question volume has collapsed [to] about 300&quot; appears to be an artifact of the last category being the current month, January 2026, even though we&#39;re only in the 5th day as of this posting. (Specifically, 321 as of Jan-5 @ 10:30 AM EDT). I expect the number will be in the 2,000+ range by the end of the month, matching both recent trends and a simple extrapolation from the first few days. (Which would still be the worst full month on record.)

Aggressive moderation is responsible for declining engagement over the past decade. Today, well, nobody would have gone there in the first place.

Previous Decline: When you&#39;re knowledgeable enough to properly ask the question and not be shut down by moderators you are already capable of figuring it out for yourself, so asking it is worthless unless you&#39;re just looking for likes or whatever. I guess I&#39;m jaded because I have a history of initial configuration issues with weird conflicts breaking everything bef

&quot;draws on Stack Overflow&#39;s own corpus for training data&quot; -- and just where is AI going to get its training data on future issues that come up? You can&#39;t exactly feed it a manual and hope it will understand and be able to extrapolate answers, it just regurgitates what&#39;s already been posted with a certain degree of &quot;confidence&quot;. So if SO goes, because everyone is relying on LLMs, it becomes and oroborous situation.

Stack Overflow was awesome, but now I have an API and documentation expert on _everything_ about software development sitting in a chatroom giving me expert answers and advice right when I ask for it. It&#39;s like Linus Torwalds and an army of software project leads are just sitting there waiting to answer when I come with my problem. I don&#39;t even search anymore, I ask the question, add layers and &quot;if not, then how&quot; and &quot;how would you do this specific thing&quot; and buddy AI spits out an essay on how to do it and

was from imposing so many constraints on question asking that it drove people away. Many SO users and mods are so pretentious that they will drive any new users away. In the early days it was not so, you didn&#39;t have to be an expert or have an in-depth knowledge of how SO works to post a question. Now users that post questions are also shut down if they aren&#39;t great questions, and not many help users improve questions. I understand that there needs to be some kind of quality maintained, but I am an active us

S.O. was full of pretentious jerks, so part of me is glad they are suffering. On the other hand, I don&#39;t wish to see the site outright die, just humbled.

Donald Trump’s moves to invade Venezuela, abduct its president and first lady, invite global corporations to exploit its resources, and leave the nation’s feckless authoritarian regime largely intact range from blatantly illegal to facially insane. And the MAGA response to them is the most illustrative yet of the movement’s utter ideological and moral bankruptcy. This is a president who promised to put America first: He ran on isolationism, as well as an end to the era of wars of choice, foreign quagmires, and the U.S. as the world’s police officer. What Trump has offered instead: wars of choice, with America as the world’s plunderer—and his followers not only cheer but invent ridiculous pretexts to defend this utterly unjustifiable move.

Trump is clear: He does not care about restoring democratic governance to Venezuela. He doesn’t like Nicolás Maduro and wanted the spectacle of bringing him to the U.S. in handcuffs. He does like Venezuelan oil, and because he believes that American military power should allow him to grab whatever he’d like, he plans to take a lot of it. The administration likes to accuse Venezuela of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and in theory that’s one of the reasons Maduro is being prosecuted—but the former president of Honduras faced similar charges and received a pardon from Trump. The president says the U.S. plans to “run” Venezuela for … well, how long is unclear. He doesn’t plan to give a helping hand to María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader who observers say won last year’s election but saw it stolen by the Maduro regime. She also recently won the Nobel Peace Prize that Trump believes he deserved, and her accepting it instead of refusing it and saying it should go to Trump is, according to some insiders, the reason he’s hanging her out to dry. (“If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ she’d be the president of Venezuela today,” one source told the Washington Post.) Instead, he’s backing Maduro’s No. 2, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, whom Trump sees as more amenable to American oil interests.

In other words: He’s keeping Maduro’s disastrous despotic regime in place, just with a new figurehead. There seems to be no real plan to extract the U.S. from Venezuela. And now the president and his lackeys are threatening to invade other countries too: Cuba, Mexico, Colombia, Greenland.

This flies in the face of everything MAGA supposedly stands for. So what are MAGA loyalists doing in response? They’re lining up and making excuses.

Why did Trump pardon the Honduran president for what prosecutors deemed “one of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking conspiracies in the world”? Per Secretary of State Marco Rubio, “He felt that in that particular case there was unfairness.” (If you asked Trump himself: “The man that I pardoned was, if you could equate it to us, he was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump,” he said. “This was a man who was persecuted very unfairly. He was the head of the country.”) Maduro, of course, was also the head of a country—but for some reason, that’s different.

What about Trump’s promise at his inauguration that “we will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, by the wars we never get into”? Or, as Vice President J.D. Vance put it on the pages of the Wall Street Journal, “Trump’s Best Foreign Policy? Not Starting Any Wars.” Per that same Vance, who seems to be channeling the “Everyone Is 12 Now” theory of MAGA politics, starting wars is OK, actually, if you’re mad enough. “Are we just supposed to allow a communist to steal our stuff in our hemisphere and do nothing?” he asked on X.

As for whether we’re occupying Venezuela, that’s a no, unless it’s a yes. Rubio told Face the Nation that we aren’t. Sen. Tom Cotton claimed that Trump’s statement that the U.S. “runs” Venezuela actually “means the new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands.” But when asked who is in charge in Venezuela, Trump offered a clearer answer: “We’re in charge.”

But wait, isn’t MAGA an anti-interventionist movement? “This is not interventionism,” insisted Sen. Lindsey Graham, straining the possible meaning of the word interventionism beyond reality.

MAGA talking heads were even more blatant about justifying the invasion. Influencer Will Chamberlain, back in 2020, asserted that “the Republican Party is no longer the party of regime change and endless wars” and warned: “If you want to be its standard-bearer, that is a nonnegotiable position.” He is now cheering that “the future of American foreign policy isn’t regime change, but regime control.” Mike Cernovich didn’t shy away from the idea that America is turning Venezuela into a new American colony, arguing, “Occupation is moral when done correctly.” (What does a moral occupation look like? It means choosing “to rule a primitive people and extract resources for our benefits, with the Christian moral duty to elevate them.”)

“I’m as reflexively non-interventionist as anyone can possibly be,” wrote conservative provocateur Matt Walsh, “but Venezuela appears to be a resounding victory and one of the most brilliant military operations in American history.” After deeming international law “fake and gay,” he argued, “The only international law is that big and powerful countries get to do what they want.” I’m not sure what definition of noninterventionist translates to “Big and powerful countries get to do what they want, including intervene abroad,” but this is MAGA morality in one tweet: Whatever Trump does is good, words are meaningless, and there is no ideology except that whatever Trump does is good.

The usual MAGA defectors—Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene—offered their usual criticisms that this isn’t what MAGA stands for. But the protests are starting to ring a little hollow after the 456th time the president said he would do something, then did the opposite. What is now apparent to anyone willing to see it is that there is no MAGA ideology. There is no moral core. There is no organizing philosophy. There is simply a reckless and self-interested president who desperately wants to be admired, who is a master of distraction, and who sees the White House as a very fine way to enrich him and his family.

There is much to distract from in this moment. We don’t hear a lot these days about the president’s old promise to “drain the swamp,” perhaps because it’s astoundingly obvious that the White House has never been swampier. The recently released secret testimony from special counsel Jack Smith clearly places the president at the head of a criminal conspiracy to undermine a free and fair election in the United States. Americans continue to struggle to afford basics, and Republicans just jacked up millions of people’s health insurance premiums. The release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes has not been flattering to the president, which is perhaps why his administration continues to withhold a great many of them. Trump’s deportation scheme is increasingly unpopular, as it turns out that most Americans don’t love the idea of a racist paramilitary force nabbing people off the street and shipping them to a Salvadoran torture prison.

“Start a war for oil to distract from problems at home” is the dumbest plot, but it seems to be our current storyline. And most of MAGA, a hollowed-out movement of unprincipled and morally vacant shills and sycophants, seems keen to play along.

In 2026, there’s one easy resolution we should all commit to: Be better consumers of media.

Traditional media is in crisis, thanks to a combination of Trump administration attacks, corporate takeovers, and technological innovations. Social media sites compete for our attention by offering us addictive little bites: Outrage-bait tweets and short-form shock value TikTok videos, served up according to algorithms that track how long we linger and feed us more and more of what keeps us locked in (which is often what makes us angry).

For young people raised on smartphones, this has meant that most of them seem to lack the attentional ability to actually read news articles in their entirety. Only 15% of adults under 30 say they follow the news most or all of the time, and that percentage has declined since 2016, according to Pew. While majorities of Americans over 50 regularly seek out the news, young adults largely do not—70% of them say they see political news simply because they come across it, which happens largely via social media. Nearly 40% rely on “influencers” for news, because, as one 21-year-old man told Pew, “If I agree with that person already, if I already have background with that person, then I’ll probably trust him more than some news site.”

This is troubling enough. Except now, some once-legitimate news outlets are following suit, and pledging to tell viewers what they want to hear and already believe, rather than what’s true and what it means. CBS, now helmed by former opinion writer and Substacker Bari Weiss, just relaunched their flagship CBS Evening News show newly anchored by Tony Dokoupil, who opened the program’s reboot by telling viewers, “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.” Dokoupil promised that “From now on, what you see and hear on the news will reflect what you see and hear in your own life.”

Programming that simply regurgitates what people already see, hear, and believe in their own lives is not, by any definition, “news” or even new. News media of course report stories that are relevant to their readers’ and viewers’ lives. But they should also be reporting the things those readers and viewers should know but don’t: Political corruption or malfeasance; the actions of the very powerful; the disasters afflicting the less fortunate; innovations and world-changing achievements; the ways in which choices made in Washington invisibly but indelibly shape the lives of average people. The job of the reporter is to report what’s true, and to help the reader or viewer understand why it matters or what it means, which often requires bringing in subject matter experts who are less “elites” than people who have spent years amassing knowledge and whose insights can expand minds and deepen public understanding. Mimicking the social media model of simply affirming people’s own beliefs, biases, and animosities and insisting the guy next door knows as much about nuclear fission as a nuclear physicist is an anathema to real journalism.

It’s also perpetuating the problem. People haven’t lost trust in mainstream media because mainstream media outlets have routinely lied to and manipulated them. People have lost trust in mainstream media at least in part because canny political actors have told the public that mainstream media has lied to and manipulated them, and that instead they should trust their own gut—and, of course, highly ideological activists who use short-form video and text as tools to drive engagement (and drive up their own relevance and wealth).

Take, for example, the recent fraud scandal in Minnesota. Dozens of people, many of them Somali immigrants, have been accused and convicted of bilking federal social services programs for hundreds of millions of dollars in a sprawling and remarkably well-organized fraud involving autism care and a nonprofit called “Feeding Our Future” (the alleged mastermind of the fraud was the nonprofit’s head, a white woman). President Trump has jumped on the issue, using it to hammer his anti-immigrant views; several prominent conservatives have called to denaturalize and deport U.S. citizens who were involved in the scheme.

Now, right-wing influencers have made uncovering other acts of alleged Somali fraud something of a competition. In an act that has shades of Pizzagate, one man showed up at daycare centers wielding a camera and demanding to be let inside, ostensibly to prove that there were no children there and the centers were more illegal money grabs; he seemed confused that daycares are typically locked to outsiders and don’t have formal reception areas, and has been unable to offer any actual evidence of fraud. Nevertheless, his video went viral, and was shared by the vice president and the director of the FBI. And there have been real and devastating consequences: Innocent Somalis have been harassed and threatened; Somali-run daycares have been vandalized. Based, it seems, solely on the claims of one right-wing influencer, Trump has cut off all federal childcare funds to Minnesota, money that thousands of families rely on to afford care for their kids.

Conservative influencers are claiming that there was a widespread coverup not only by Democrats in office, but by news media. “Right now the mainstream media is doing nothing to cover the Somali fraud in Minnesota,” one conservative activist with a million followers tweeted a few days before the new year. MAGA Voice told its 1.4 million followers that “CBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota / PBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota” and continued that convention to accuse six mainstream television networks of not reporting on the fraud case. “You literally can’t find a single mainstream article about the Minnesota fraud… Not even one…” reads one tweet that has been shared more than 9,000 times.

“Somali fraud” became a talking point in right-wing circles thanks to an article in the conservative National Journal co-authored by right-wing activist Christopher Rufo. It claims that not only were Somalis defrauding the government, but, as the headline says, “the largest funder of [the terrorist group] al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.” The piece then proceeds to include no evidence for its al-Shabaab claim, save for one quote attributed to an anonymous source (later in the piece, one law enforcement official notes that Somalis, like many immigrant groups, send money to relatives back home, and that in Somalia, al-Shabaab is “taking a cut”—not that Somali-Americans are sending reams of cash to terrorists, or that the Minnesota taxpayer is their primary bankroller). That they were just hearing about this scandal, conservatives claimed, was evidence of the media’s complicity in a coverup.

It was, instead, evidence of their own insularity, incuriosity, and apparent inability to read the news or even google. The City Journal article came out in mid-November; the Times had covered the case in March and again in August and kept up the coverage as the story evolved and as federal indictments turned into mounting convictions. Sahan Journal, a Minnesota publication catering to the Somali community, covered it a year ago. The Associated Press, CBS News, and a half-dozen local Minnesota news outlets also covered the story months before Rufo was on the case.

It is true that, so far, mainstream media outlets have not gone around accusing daycare operators of fraud with no evidence beyond an online search, a hunch, and an unheeded demand to be allowed into childcare centers to video the kids; this is a good thing. Real investigative journalism takes care to get the facts right, and that takes time. Unlike in the Feeding Our Future fraud, there is no criminal case to cover in these so far unsubstantiated claims of daycare fraud.

Being the first influencer to accuse immigrants of a serious crime may drive engagement and make one a right-wing hero, but it’s not the same as actual investigative reporting, which requires verifying facts rather than simply asserting them. And when reputable outlets get things wrong—and, being run by humans, they sometimes do—they publicly correct the record. Ideologues and influencers tend to just ignore or deny their own mistakes. If the influencer pounding on daycare doors is shown evidence that the care centers are legit, do we think he admit he was wrong, let alone go viral for it? And if he does walk back his claims, will the many millions of people who have taken them seriously get the memo—or will they continue on with the impression that a rampant fraud occurred and the legacy media simply refused to talk about it? Do we believe that the president will restore childcare funding and repay any lost wages to the parents whose ability to work just got scrambled?

This is all incredibly corrosive. The incoming A.I. era seems primed to supercharge this already perilous situation. With bots sounding more human by the day and the ability to create highly realistic photos and videos of just about whatever one pleases, the very concept of a shared reality may be in rapid decline. What we see with our own eyes on our phones—what we see and hear political leaders saying, what we see and hear our fellow citizens doing—is becoming less reliable, and it takes ever-greater sophistication to ferret out what’s real.

In this new Alice-in-Wonderland semi-reality, we need honest, accountable, real journalism. Instead of shoring up reputable outlets, though, too many are being sacrificed to the president by greedy owners who seem eager to profit handsomely even if it comes at the cost of America’s once-robust democratic functioning enabled by the fourth estate. CBS’s rightward turn, including the appointment of Weiss—who was an opinion writer (not a reporter) with no experience in TV news—has come in the wake of its parent company being acquired by Skydance Media (now Paramount Skydance), owned by David Ellison, the son of Trump-supporting billionaire Larry Ellison. The younger Ellison was only able to acquire Paramount with the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, which Trump has captured and whose power the president continues to abuse. Announcing the merger, FCC chairman and Trump loyalist Brendan Carr said that he welcomes “Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” including the appointment of a right-wing think tank employee as CBS’s new ombudsman.

Ellison is now in a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN—another network the president believes is against him. Trump has implied that he will again abuse the Federal Communications Commission’s power to grant or block the merger the younger Ellison badly wants. It’s not hard to see Weiss’s decision to pull a ready-to-air 60 Minutes segment about the Salvadoran torture-prison to which Trump is deporting immigrants—after Trump complained that 60 Minutes had been mean to him—as part of a broader strategy to gut media companies that allow reporters to do their jobs rather than work as mouthpieces for the administration, all in the service of enriching a tiny few.

There is not much the average American citizen can do to stop billionaires from grabbing and gutting storied news networks, and other authoritarian leaders have run similar playbooks in their own countries, most notably Hungary. What we can do, though, is direct our dollars and our attention to the reputable and well-run outlets that remain—and even though local news was dying well before Trump’s second term and national outlets are being disemboweled like Hannibal Lector is on the run, there are, thankfully, still many newspapers, news magazines, and television news networks doing real journalism. But they are facing threats from all sides: A vengeful president; a distracted and disengaged audience used to endless scrolling and pop-pop-pops of entertainment; the creeping unreality of A.I.

Fundamentally, we all need to be better news consumers. News outlets also see what’s shared and what’s ignored, which stories draw clicks and eyeballs and which are scrolled past, which outlets are growing their subscription bases and which are shrinking. That doesn’t determine editorial decisions, but it would be naïve to believe it doesn’t at all shape them. And if reputable news outlets aren’t getting readers and viewers, they also aren’t earning subscriber and ad dollars, which means there’s less cash to pay journalists to do the often-slow and often-pedantic work of good journalism.

It’s not just journalism that’s at stake; it’s your own brain. Do you believe you are better off getting news and information primarily from social media feeds that have been cultivated to push your particular outrage buttons, delivered by people who are accountable to no one? Or might it be better for your mind (your intellectual abilities and your basic sanity) to read a range of stories from across a big and complicated world, and sometimes see your priors challenged?

It’s practically a national pastime to complain about the media. Instead of asking “who says stuff I agree with?” try questioning a publication or individual’s editorial policies. Do they check their facts and check them again before publishing, to make sure that they get it right most of the time? Are they transparent when they’re wrong? Do they hold the powerful to account, no matter who “the powerful” may be? Do they approach their subject matter with curiosity rather than an agenda?

Social media, A.I., Trump, and corporate greed do not have to be the end of reliable journalism. But they’re definitely not going to save it. As the old PBS slogan goes, that’s only made possible by viewers like you.

There was a time, not long ago, when people would claim with a straight face that Donald Trump was a populist who prioritized the interests of working-class Americans and avoided stupid foreign wars. “Trump’s Best Foreign Policy? Not Starting Any Wars,” then-Sen. J.D. Vance crowed in 2023. As Trump assembled his second-term national security team in 2024, Republican Sen. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, claimed to be “amazed by the Trump Cabinet” and the president’s rejection of “warmongers.” A mere two months ago, one of those Cabinet officials, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, told a conference in Bahrain that Trump had ended the “counterproductive and endless cycle of regime change or nation building” that has defined U.S. foreign policy for decades.

The president’s brazenly illegal military assault on Caracas last week would embarrass these people, were they capable of embarrassment. Trump did not govern as a populist during his first term; his second has been an unabashed celebration of crass imperialism and the superrich.

And the superrich are thrilled. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman croons that Trump’s war in Venezuela “will lower oil prices, which is good for America.” The Jeff Bezos editorial board hailed the invasion as a happy confluence of “justice” and technical prowess. Elon Musk is patching things up with the president, proclaiming the war “a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.” Nor are Republicans the only enthusiasts. Democratic Party fundraiser Charles Myers is organizing a post-Maduro field trip to Venezuela with about 20 hedge funders and asset managers to scout investment opportunities in “oil and gas,” as well as “construction” and “tourism.”

The story of American capital profiteering on American war is as old as America itself, and Trump openly claims to have invaded Venezuela for its oil. But in this particular case, the Wall Street opportunists have their work cut out for them. On Saturday, Politico reported that Trump offered U.S. oil executives “reimbursement” for oil assets that were nationalized by the Venezuelan government decades ago—but only on the condition that they actually take control of the country’s oil fields. Ten days after making the offer, the president doesn’t have any takers. Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is outdated, and it will require tremendous investment to meaningfully expand production, something oil companies are reluctant to do when large profits are readily available from high prices and low corporate investment. We are thus presented with the bizarre spectacle of an American president waging an imperialist war on behalf of American executives who are reluctant to claim the spoils. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, is telling reporters that Cuba may be next in line for American-imposed regime change, as the wife of Trump’s racism czar Stephen Miller points to Greenland.

Embarrassing as these developments are for the right-wing populists who supported Trump in 2024, I have always harbored some sympathy for their political plight. Conservative populists are generally right about war (bad) and poverty (wrong), and they claim to recognize warmongering and elite favor trading as unpleasant features of Republican politics. At the same time, I have maintained contempt for the belief that Trump might deliver the U.S. from those evils. His first term was defined by a massive tax cut for the rich, a bank deregulation bill that delivered a rash of bank failures, the destruction of a standing diplomatic treaty with Iran, and sustained, vocal support for the violent and corrupt governments of Israel and Saudi Arabia. All of these agenda items could have been implemented by a President Mitt Romney, had an election or two gone a little differently. The populist fantasy this time around was that Vance and a few other Trump insiders who had built careers on populist branding might persuade Trump to turn away from the Republican old guard.

A year into his second term, Trump has once again cut taxes for the rich, in addition to doubling health insurance premiums for 20 million families and declaring the national affordability crisis a “hoax.” His invasion of Venezuela suggests a return not only to the half-baked adventurism of George W. Bush in Iraq but to various coups attempted and consummated by Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.

So Trump’s populist pitch to voters once again turned out to be a fraud. But the populist energy that fueled his reelection isn’t going away, even if the air is coming out of the Epstein jet’s tires. Trump was propelled into office by the two defining events of the 21st century: Bush the Younger’s disaster in Iraq and the financial crisis of 2008, both of which provided the country with ample evidence of elite incompetence and self-dealing. But the Democratic Party’s leadership has remained too entwined with the same interests and ideologues to establish itself as an enduring alternative to the elite predation that has been so obvious under Republican leadership. Barack Obama captured Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 but remained at war in Afghanistan for the remainder of his presidency. Joe Biden followed through on Trump’s first-term Middle East program all the way to a genocide in Gaza, and one of Biden’s last actions in office was to offer a $25 million reward for information leading to Nicolás Maduro’s “arrest”—the same word members of the Trump administration use to describe their operation in Venezuela.

Trump’s presidency is in trouble. Every Epstein file dump reveals his long friendship with the sex trafficker to be worse than we knew, and he is still illegally withholding tens of thousands of Epstein files from public scrutiny—not the action of a man comfortable with the contents. Prices remain high, unemployment is rising, and the economy has been stuck in a hiring freeze for just about the entirety of Trump’s presidency. Democratic Party leadership clearly hopes it can ride all of this ineptitude to victory in 2026 and 2028 without promising much more than a return to normality. And Trump’s failures mean that Democrats will, indeed, have the wind at their backs. But the party has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory before. The safe bet is to break with the corrupt and violent tradition Trump so unmistakably embodies.

In a lengthy press conference Saturday detailing the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump confirmed, with stunning frankness, the classic leftist critique of American foreign policy: that, at least for as long as he’s in power, it’s all about the oil.

Over the past few months, Trump and his aides had characterized their pressure campaign against Maduro’s regime as a war on “narco-terrorism” and a fight to restore democratic rule. But following Maduro’s extraction in a complex military and intelligence operation, the U.S. president was clear about its true motive.

“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” he said, adding, “We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.” Then came the kicker: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in” and spend billions of dollars fixing the energy infrastructure that they developed decades ago, until socialist regimes nationalized their wells, then wrecked them. The wealth resulting from this grab-back will benefit the Venezuelan people, he said, but he noted that much of it will reimburse America’s oil companies.

Finally, Trump said, U.S. troops will be sent to enforce Big Oil’s rule if necessary. “They always say ‘boots on the ground’—we’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said. “We had boots on the ground last night,” as part of the operation to extract Maduro. He said the military was poised to go in again if needed.

There’s a lengthy history, starting in the Cold War, of the U.S. military and the CIA co-opting or overthrowing Central and South American governments—including in Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Chile, as well as several attempts to do so in Cuba—to bolster the interests of U.S. corporations, including United Fruit, IT&T, and various oil companies.

But rarely have the presidents who ordered these interventions been so blatant about the primary motive. Instead, at least in public, they spoke of fighting communism or upholding democracy, even when the enemies weren’t really communist and their allies weren’t at all democratic.

But Trump was up-front about his reasons, and repeatedly so. Several times during his press conference, he talked of bringing in big U.S. oil companies to regain their former assets. (In fact, though, American firms never owned the land where they drilled for Venezuela’s oil riches, and, as in many other countries, the interplay between foreign exploiters and local nationalizers was more complex than Trump’s narrative suggests.) And he also discussed restoring “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere”—a policy that his recently issued National Security Strategy called the “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. “We are reasserting American power in a very powerful way in our home region,” he said—not to protect democracy but for its own sake.

Maduro and his wife were captured, then indicted by the U.S. attorney in New York, on charges of drug trafficking. Trump, however, all but admitted that this wasn’t the real purpose of the elaborate operation. Just a month ago, while officers were planning the attack on Venezuela, Trump pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been convicted of drug trafficking. Asked about this at Saturday’s news conference, Trump said he had issued the pardon because Hernández, who had supported Trump, had been “treated unfairly” by former President Joe Biden.

As for democracy, Trump was asked whether he would support María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize–winning leader of Venezuela’s opposition movement, to lead a new government—or even whether he had spoken with her. Trump answered no to both questions. “It would be very tough for her to be the leader,” he said in a dismissive tone. “She doesn’t have the respect in the country.” Nor did he even mention Edmundo González, who was elected Venezuela’s president in 2024 and fled to safe exile in Spain after Maduro stole the election.

Earlier on Saturday, in an interview on Fox News, Trump acted as if he’d barely thought about Machado or González. “I mean, I don’t know about what kind of an election that was,” he said, referring to the 2024 contest. Meanwhile, he said, “they have a vice president, you know.”

Later, during the press conference, Trump acknowledged that the Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodríguez—who, by law, has now been sworn in as president—had been handpicked by Maduro. He noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now “working with” Rodríguez, who is “willing to do what’s necessary to make Venezuela great again.”

Venezuelan law requires an ascending vice president to call for new elections, but this doesn’t seem in the offing. Asked who precisely is going to “run” Venezuela, Trump replied, “We’re designating various people. … It’s largely going to be the people standing right behind me”—referring to Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine. “Venezuela has a lot of bad people,” Trump added. “We’re not going to take a chance that one of those people take over from Maduro.”

Asked how long this transition will take, Trump said he would “like to do it quickly” but that rebuilding the country’s oil infrastructure “takes a period of time.”

Still, it remains unclear how America really will “run” Venezuela, a country of 28.5 million, roughly the size of Texas or California. Its military officers, most of whom were loyal to Maduro, are still in place, as are its Cabinet ministers and bureaucrats. Trump said that many of them will soon be switching sides. Maybe, maybe not. There are also more than 20,000 Cubans in Venezuela, many of them military and intelligence officers, many others health care workers, all of them providing services in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will they be leaving? Will power struggles break out? Will the military simply adapt to Washington’s demands in exchange for guarantees to stay in power?

Then there are broader questions. The whole world is watching not just this operation—an impressive tactical display of U.S. military power—but what happens next. Trump’s unabashedly imperial rationale for the action may inspire Russian President Vladimir Putin to double down on his claims of rightful dominance over Ukraine—and Chinese President Xi Jinping to feel more confident in his claims over Taiwan. At the same time, antiregime activists in Iran may feel emboldened, especially since Trump said, just the other day, that he stands “locked and loaded” to punish Tehran’s leaders if they killed protesters.

Finally, there is Cuba. In his press conference, Trump noted similarities between Cuba and Venezuela. Both countries have been wrecked by socialist dictators, and “we want to help the people in Cuba.” Rubio, a Cuban American who has avidly supported the anti-Castro movement in Florida (a state he once represented as a senator), added, “If I lived in Havana and worked in the government, I’d be concerned.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. aircraft carrier and its supporting armada, which had mobilized off Venezuela’s shore before the operation, remain deployed and on high alert. “We’re ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,” Trump said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Palo Alto Networks is on shopping spree. The company is reportedly considering a $400 million purchase of Israeli cybersecurity start up Koi, which raised $48 million in funding last year.

Palo Alto told The Register it does not comment on rumor and speculation. However, a person close to Palo Alto said that this is one of several rumors that have sprouted up following a visit to Tel Aviv last month by CEO Nikesh Arora.

&quot;This is not the first guess coming out of the Israel media following that visit,&quot; said the person who was not authorized to make an official statement about the matter on behalf of the company. &quot;I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be the last.&quot;

During the two-day stay, Arora met with the company&#39;s 1,600 employees there as well as the teams at CyberArk, which Palo Alto is in negotiations to acquire.

Koi offers endpoint software security and boasts that it can &quot;Secure anything with an &#39;Install&#39; button.&quot; Koi was founded by three members of the IDF&#39;s 8200 Intelligence Corps who claim it took them 30 minutes to create and publish an extension that could bypass most security environments, including those at large enterprises. Born from that was Koi, which they say &quot;scans, governs, and monitors self-provisioned enterprise software at scale.&quot;

Palo Alto has been in the mood for M&A recently with three acquisitions announced last year.

It closed on its purchase of Protect AI in July. Protect AI&#39;s staff and technology are the cornerstone of Palo Alto&#39;s PrismaAIRS product, designed to mitigate threats posed by AI, the company said.

In July it also announced that it would buy CyberArk for $25 billion which, if it closes, would be the biggest acquisition in the company&#39;s history. During his visit to Tel Aviv, Arora reassured CyberArk employees that Palo Alto did not envision large cuts to the workforce. He said the deal was focused on CyberArk&#39;s technology and talent.

CyberArk provides identity access and monitoring and moves closer to providing a unified platform for all of a customer&#39;s cybersecurity needs.

Palo Alto is giving CyberArk shareholders $45 cash and 2.2 shares of Palo Alto stock for each CyberArk share, about a 26-percent premium for CyberArk shares at the time the deal was announced in July. It expects it to close in the second half of fiscal 2026.

In November, Palo Alto also announced the planned acquisition of Chronosphere, &quot;a next-generation observability platform built to scale for the AI era,&quot; the company said.The company hopes that this acquisition will strengthen its ability to help organizations navigate modern applications and AI workload demand within a unified data and security foundation. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/starlink_free_service_venezuela/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US just invaded your country, kidnapped your president, and wants to take your oil. But good news, Venezuelans, Starlink claims you can get a month of free Internet, even though it doesn&#39;t say how that could work in a place where it doesn&#39;t offer service.

Starlink added a page to its Help Center on Sunday detailing its offer of Starlink service credits for Venezuelans, providing free connectivity through February 3. According to the page, active Starlink customers in Venezuela will see service credits proactively applied to their accounts, while inactive customers will be able to reactivate through the beginning of February without having to pay for service.

There&#39;s just one big problem with Elon Musk&#39;s latest generous humanitarian offer: Starlink isn&#39;t available in Venezuela.

Take a look at the company&#39;s service map and you&#39;ll see, amid a sea of light-blue South American nations with active Starlink service, a dark-blue Venezuela, indicating that Starlink is &quot;coming soon&quot; to the latest country to be targeted for exports of freedom, US style.

What does that mean for Venezuelan Starlink customers, however few or many there may be? They&#39;re roaming, naturally.

&quot;At this time, our focus is on enabling connectivity for new and existing customers to support the people of Venezuela with free service credits,&quot; Starlink said on the help page. &quot;If you already have a Starlink kit in your possession, you can select a Roam plan to use your Starlink in Venezuela.&quot;

Starlink roaming in unauthorized countries that differ from the buyer&#39;s shipping address, we note, &quot;may cause your service to be restricted immediately,&quot; according to Starlink&#39;s Help Center. One would hope the company is going to overlook those restrictions, considering Starlink receivers aren&#39;t available in Venezuela, meaning that anyone roaming in the country is operating in a nation unauthorized for service. We reached out to Starlink with questions, but didn&#39;t hear back.

In addition to the problem of Venezuela not being a country with active Starlink service, the company said it doesn&#39;t know if or when anyone in the nation will be able to purchase a receiver in order to get that free month of access.

&quot;We are actively monitoring evolving conditions and regulatory requirements,&quot; Starlink said. &quot;We do not have yet have [sic] a timeline for local purchase availability.&quot;

Note the key word: purchase - meaning yet again that Venezuelans hoping to get a free month of Starlink amid US-triggered power and internet outages won&#39;t be getting free dishes as part of the deal.

After all, the world&#39;s richest man learned the hard way in Ukraine what handing out $350 receivers can do to his bottom line. Starlink didn&#39;t repeat that mistake when it offered &quot;free&quot; service to North Carolina residents hit by Hurricane Helene in 2024, instead burying the lede on the need for users to spend upwards of $400 to cash in on that free service offer.

As noted by Gartner distinguished VP analyst Bill Ray, chief of research on emerging technology and trends, this move is a political one on SpaceX&#39;s part.

&quot;Very few people will be able to get access to the necessary equipment, but SpaceX will be hoping that this might smooth the way to getting a local permit under whatever administration emerges in Venezuela,&quot; Ray told The Register in an email. &quot;Starlink has the technical capability to provide service just about anywhere, but is limited by local regulations.&quot;

Ray added that Starlink has been providing service in Iran despite being in breach of international regulations, as it has no fear of reprisals from the Iranian government.

&quot;That&#39;s not going to happen in China, or Russia, as both countries could impose economic sanctions,&quot; Ray said. &quot;Iran has no such ability, and neither does Venezuela.&quot;

In other words, the free service to internet-deprived Venezuelans isn&#39;t the point at all - Musk is just trying to grease the pan when the dust settles and a new government sets up shop in the country. It&#39;s another chance for Musk to make a buck off of goodwill generated on the back of human suffering. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/qualcomm_launches_snapdragon_x2_plus/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Qualcomm is trying to become a major player in the laptop processor space. Its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips, along with a concerted effort to improve the Windows on Arm software ecosystem, have made it a credible alternative to Intel and AMD, although it&#39;s still stuck at below 1% market share. On Monday at CES in Las Vegas, the company showed the next step in this strategy: the next-gen Snapdragon X2 Plus chips, which are targeted at budget and mainstream systems.

Available in two SKUs – a 10-core model and a 6-core alternative – the Snapdragon X2 Plus boasts a maximum 4 GHz clock speed, support for high-speed LPDDR5x memory, and an NPU that achieves up to 80 TOPS (trillion operations per second) for local AI. Qualcomm claims that the new chips, based on a 3nm process, will provide multi-day battery life in laptops due to their improved power efficiency, requiring 43 percent less power than their immediate predecessors.

The perf improvements come as a result of the more effective cores built into the main CPU. Qualcomm claims that its third-gen Oryon CPU cores are up to 35 percent faster at single-core tasks than the prior-gen Snapdragon X processors and 17 percent faster on multi-core tasks. Its Adreno GPU is 39 percent quicker at GPU tasks, and its Hexagon NPU is 78 percent more performant than those in the original Snapdragon X Plus line.

In fact, in its own test of Geekbench 6.5 multi-core, Qualcomm claims that the X2 Plus 10-core chip is 52 percent more performant than Intel’s current-generation processors at around 25 watts of platform power. No word on how it will stack up to Intel’s upcoming Panther Lake CPUs, though.

Qually’s marketing team has really outdone themselves with this chart, which is clearly intended to make the X2 Plus look impressive. To our eyes, the line showing the 3.1x uplift in relative performance over the Core Ultra 7 265U is nearly the same size as the 52 percent uplift over Intel’s 265V. Not sure why they felt the need to present the figures this way, since they actually look quite good.

That said, we do know that Qualcomm’s prior-gen Snapdragon X chips have offered some seriously low-power experiences. For example, when Tom’s Hardware tested Lenovo’s ThinkPad T14s with a Snapdragon X Elite chip inside, the laptop lasted through a whopping 21 hours of continuous web surfing, video playback, and 3D animation at 150 nits of brightness.

The Snapdragon X2 Plus chips follow closely on the heels of Qualcomm’s higher-end and more expensive Snapdragon X2 Elite chips, which were announced this past fall. Those processors are available in three SKUs, which range from 12 to 18 cores and carry a boost frequency up to 5 GHz, along with up to a 1.85 GHz GPU, and a generous amount of cache. The memory bandwidth on the highest end SKU, the X2 Elite Extreme, is higher, with a maximum speed of 228 GB/s versus 152 GB/s for the other two X2 Elite SKUs and the X2 Pluses. This could help with some local AI workloads where memory speed is critical.

All of the Snapdragon X2 processors have the same 80 TOPS NPU, however. That means that any PC with a Snapdragon X2 chip will qualify as a Microsoft Copilot+ PC, and will get access to a handful of exclusive local Windows AI features including Microsoft’s controversial Recall app and Windows Studio Effects, which does background blurring, auto framing, and other special effects using the NPU.

Qualcomm has worked with a number of app publishers to build Snapdragon X hardware support into their AI-enhanced products. For example, reps showed us how Topaz Photo does picture enhancement tasks such as denoising and upscaling using a combination of the chip&#39;s NPU and GPU. They also showed a demo of a Nexa AI local LLM that uses the NPU to query data from folders on your local drive. As an example, a rep asked the software to find a GitHub password from a file on the laptop. We really hope Qualcomm doesn’t actually store passwords in plain text.

While Qualcomm has not disclosed pricing for systems based on the Snapdragon X2 Plus or Snapdragon X2 Elite chips – that will be determined by the OEMs that use them – we can guesstimate that those based on the X2 Plus will likely be just a little bit cheaper than configurations with the X2 Elite. That being said, right now, neither X2 chip is out and the price difference between last-gen X Plus and X Elite chips seems to be minimal – in fact, in some cases, systems with the better chip are cheaper.

As of this writing, Microsoft is selling the Surface Pro (13-inch) with Snapdragon X Plus for $1,099, but the one with Snapdragon X Elite starts at $999. Lenovo.com actually charges $173 more to have a Snapdragon X Plus chip on a ThinkPad T14s than it does for an X Elite chip with more cores and higher clocks. Perhaps Microsoft and Lenovo are just cleaning out inventory, as we would expect the price differential to favor the lesser chip by at least $100 when the new models come out.

Qualcomm has big ambitions for the entire Snapdragon X series and the software ecosystem that works with Windows on Arm. Since the original Snapdragon X laptops came out in 2024, there’s been a surge in apps that run natively under Snapdragon, and most others run under emulation. Even though Snapdragon laptops are not sold as gaming machines, you can play a number of games on them, including Minecraft, Roblox, Fallout and GTA V.

At Computex in June 2024, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon claimed that Arm-powered laptops would account for 50 percent of the Windows PC market within five years. (Qualcomm is currently the only Arm-powered Windows laptop CPU maker.) Five years haven’t passed yet, but enterprises are not impressed so far, if sales numbers are any indication.

According to analyst firm IDC, 153 million commercial PCs were sold worldwide between Q4 of 2024 and Q3 of 2025, but only a million of those, or 0.65 percent, were powered by Qualcomm chips.

“There&#39;s a reluctance to change from the Enterprise side of things to going to Arm-based,” IDC analyst Jean Philippe Bouchard told The Register in an interview. “Everyone is kind of geared towards x86.”

However, Bouchard pointed out that Qualcomm may see more business come its way both as a result of its long battery life and some helpful security features. Snapdragon X2 Elite chips will have Snapdragon Guardian, which allows IT departments to manage remote devices even if they are powered off and unbootable, using 5G or Wi-Fi 7 connectivity.

“Tough to say what the future holds,” Bouchard said. “But they&#39;re doing everything that they need to do right in terms of performance and in terms of future.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The EU has pledged to stand firm against US threats following fines levied against Amercian tech companies for breaching recently introduced digital laws.

In the last five years, the world&#39;s richest trading bloc has introduced the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which regulates digital platforms, and the Digital Services Act (DSA), designed to curb illegal content. Since President Donald Trump&#39;s return to power in 2025, the US has become more vocal in its criticism of EU tech regulation.

Ambassador to the EU Andrew Puzder said last year that the bloc should prove its rules do not punish US companies or review them.

Late in 2025, the US Trade Representative, a government body for trade and economic policies, slammed the EU for pursuing policies that restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of US tech giants through discriminatory means.

It said unless the EU changed course, the United States &quot;will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,&quot; according to a social media post in mid-December.

However, in an interview with the Financial Times, EU competition chief Teresa Ribera said: &quot;There have been moments that we have needed to, where I have needed to, stand up and say: sorry, but we&#39;re not going to undo our regulation just because you don&#39;t like [it].&quot;

In the last year, Meta and Apple were fined by the EU under the DMA.

Meanwhile, the DSA has been employed to target X, formerly Twitter, for allegedly breaching rules on ad transparency, data access for researchers, and the revamped blue checkmark system.

The EU&#39;s stance on tech regulation could provoke US retaliation against European suppliers.

In its online missive, the US Trade Representative argued that EU tech companies such as Accenture, Amadeus, Capgemini, Mistral, and SAP &quot;have been able to operate freely in the United States for decades.&quot;

&quot;Should responsive measures be necessary, US law permits the assessment of fees or restrictions on foreign services, among other actions,&quot; it said. &quot;The United States will take a similar approach to other countries that pursue an EU-style strategy in this area.&quot;

With the EU not buckling, geopolitical tensions are set to continue affecting global tech players as 2026 progresses. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The final version of HPE&#39;s own flavor of Unix, HP-UX 11i v3, is now out of support. It is the end of a line that started in 1982.

According to HPE&#39;s HP-UX support matrix, the end of life for the final version was the last day of last year:

HPE Integrity: standard support through 31-Dec-2025

The product status is now &quot;Mature Software Product Support without Sustaining Engineering through at least 31-Dec-2028.&quot;

HPE&#39;s version numbers are complex, but the last release of HP-UX that we can find is HP-UX 11i v3 release 2505.11iv3, which was released on May 22, 2025, for HPE&#39;s Integrity servers – as The Register put it a decade ago, &quot;Integrity servers means the Superdome ones running HP-UX with Intel&#39;s fading Itanium processors and NUMA.&quot;

At least one website misses it already. Last week, OSnews reported &quot;HP-UX hits end-of-life today, and I&#39;m sad.&quot; Some see this as a potential opportunity. For instance, SUSE used the news to offer an escape route, explaining &quot;Why SUSE Linux is the Natural Heir.&quot;

HP-UX had a good run, after a long and very varied history. The first version ran on the HP 9000 Series 500 range of 32-bit machines based on the HP FOCUS multi-chip CISC processor. In 1984, the Hewlett-Packard Journal ran a detailed article on how that port was created, based on a kernel called SUN – not related to Sun Microsystems&#39; SunOS. The Bitsavers site – run by Al Kossow, who recently recovered UNIX V4 from a 52-year-old tape – has a scan of HP&#39;s 1985 brochure [PDF].

Then came a Motorola 68000 version, which ran on top of an AT&T Unix kernel, unusually stored in a ROM chip, in HP&#39;s pioneering portable Unix workstation, the HP Integral PC [PDF].

After that, it was rewritten again for HP&#39;s own in-house RISC architecture, PA-RISC. This was once a well-liked processor with its own native version of NeXTstep. At one point, Commodore investigated using it for a next-generation Amiga, the Amiga Hombre. However, the writing was on the wall for PA-RISC once HP announced it would be uniting with Intel&#39;s new EPIC architecture, as the infant Register reported all the way back in 1999.

For some time, both PA-RISC and Itanium versions were maintained more or less in parallel, until the last few releases, which were for the Itanium only. After that, the writing was on the wall and this news should not be too unexpected. Back in 2012, The Reg reported that the then-monolithic HP had started, then spiked, an x86-64 edition. Once that escape route was shut down and Itanium died, HP-UX was fated to die with it. Intel itself ended Itanium shipments in 2021 and with no new processors, that meant no new Itanium servers, and that left nothing new for HP-UX to run on.

A couple of years later, we covered the end of Linux on Itanium, but we&#39;re happy to report that we were wrong that nobody would keep maintaining it out of tree: the EPIC Linux project is still doing just that, and the T2 Linux distro still supports it. T2&#39;s lead maintainer, René Rebe, is also behind the Itanium support in GCC. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Important news for Gmail power users: Google is dropping the feature whereby Gmail can collect mail from other email accounts over POP3.

The company hasn&#39;t exactly gone out of its way to call attention to this – like actually telling anybody anything. The news appears in a support note with a sign on the door saying &quot;Learn about upcoming changes to Gmailify & POP in Gmail.&quot; The article itself is less euphemistic than its title:

Starting January 2026, Gmail will no longer provide support for the following features:

Gmailify: This feature allows you to get special features like spam protection or inbox organization applied to your third-party email account.

Check mail from other accounts: Fetching emails from third-party accounts into your Gmail account, with POP, will no longer be supported.

Firefox users, incidentally, will find the support pages locked. We had to use Chrome. When Google says there are &quot;changes&quot; to Gmailify, that really means that the Gmailify feature will be shut down.

Why is Google doing this now? Opinions vary but some market onlookers suspect it is related to the fact that POP3 requires sending passwords in plaintext. We have asked Google to comment.

About 10,000 years ago (in binary), when the future Reg FOSS desk still had a mostly full head of hair, we explained how to get the most out of Gmail, in what, by our reckoning, was the fifth piece we ever penned for this mighty organ. The second feature of the service that we called out was using it to consolidate multiple email accounts into one: collecting email from other services over POP3, which you could manage using the Gmail webmail interface. Its then-massive one gigabyte of free storage was ideal for this, and we used it ourselves to bring our little-used Hotmail, Yahoo, and AOL email into the Gmail inbox.

Well, that&#39;s going away this month. You can still access those accounts via the Gmail mobile app, but the Gmail service itself will no longer retrieve them.

As well as simple consolidation, Gmailify offered a simple, familiar interface to email from other providers. One person using this was web pioneer Jamie Zawinski for staff email at his San Francisco nightclub DNA Lounge.

As he indicates in a blog post titled Today in &quot;Google broke email,&quot; he&#39;s not happy. We don&#39;t blame him. He also notes that the company&#39;s suggestion to switch to using IMAP doesn&#39;t help him.

If you rely on Gmail to access some older email accounts in this way, it might be time to switch to using a local email client, the old-fashioned way. We suggest MZLA Thunderbird: it&#39;s free, runs the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it can talk to all manner of email servers, including Microsoft Exchange Server, as well as trusty old Usenet, and chat via XMPP and Matrix. It&#39;s another reason why you might still want a local client in the era of webmail. ®

LG’s CLOiD robot took the stage at CES 2026 on Monday, offering our first look at the bot in action. During LG’s keynote, the company showed how CLOiD can load your washer or dryer — albeit slowly – as part of its goal of creating a “zero labor home.”

CLOiD waved both of its five-finger hands as it rolled out on stage. Brandt Varner, LG’s vice president of sales in its home appliances division, followed behind and asked the bot to take care of the wet towel he was holding. “Sure, I’ll get the laundry started,” CLOiD said in a masculine-sounding voice. “Let me show everyone what I can do.”

The bot’s animated eyes “blinked” as it rolled closer to a washer that opened automatically (I hope CLOiD can open that door itself!), extending its left arm into the washer and dropping the towel into the drum. The whole process — from getting the towel to putting it in the machine — took nearly 30 seconds, which makes me wonder how long it would take to load a week’s worth of laundry.

The bot returned later in the keynote to bring a bottle of water to another presenter, Steve Scarbrough, the senior vice president of LG’s HVAC division. “I noticed by your voice and tone that you might want some water,” it said before handing over the bottle and giving Scarbrough a fist bump.

LG teased CLOiD last week before revealing more information about the bot, which the company claims can perform various household chores, such as grab milk from the fridge, toast a croissant in the oven, as well as stack and fold clothes. CLOiD closed out the show, too, facing the audience to deliver a final message about how LG’s “Affectionate Intelligence” is supposed to “improve everyday life.”

There’s still no word on when, or if, LG CLOiD will ever be available for purchase, but at least we’ll have WALL-E’s weird cousin to help out with some tasks around the home.

Getting fit is one of the most popular New Year’s resolutions, and if we’re being honest, it’s also one of the easiest to quit by week two. But with the right support, it doesn’t have to be that way this year. Earbuds like the last-gen Shokz OpenRun Pro can help keep you motivated, while their open-ear design provides a safer, more comfortable alternative to traditional wireless earbuds. And right now, they’ve hit a new low price at Amazon and Best Buy, where you can buy them for $109.95 ($50 off).

Built with sports and outdoor activities in mind, the bone-conduction headphones don’t block your ears like traditional in-ear buds, so you can still hear traffic and other surrounding sounds on busy streets. They’re also designed to stay put, meaning you don’t have to worry about them slipping off midway through a jog the way smaller earbuds can. What’s more, they carry an IP55 rating for sweat and water resistance, meaning they can handle sweaty workouts and light rain without a problem. Plus, at just 29 grams, they’re easy to wear for long periods of time, especially since you don’t have to deal with the discomfort of earbuds stuck in your ears.

It’s worth pointing out these are older buds, and Shokz now sells the OpenRun Pro 2. The newer pair notably offers AI-powered noise cancellation to help tune out distractions, while delivering richer bass and USB-C charging. They’re available for $179.95, but if you prioritize affordability over extra bells and whistles, we think the last-gen model is still worth picking up at this price.

Asus is announcing three new OLED gaming monitors at CES with “RGB stripe” technology that the company says will bring improvements to “texture clarity and color rendering consistency.”

With RGB stripes, which Samsung Display and LG Display (the two companies that usually provide the panels for gaming monitors) are also making a big deal about at CES this year, the colors of subpixels are lined up in vertical RGB stripes. The resulting clarity and color improvements “enhance your viewing experience no matter what you’re doing, making these monitors perfect picks for your multi-purpose setup,” Asus says. “Whether you want the most accurate and bold colors in your favorite game, the sharpest text for your everyday computing, or the utmost image accuracy for content creation purposes, you’ll have it.”

One of the monitors, the 27-inch ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, uses Tandem OLED tech for “incredible brightness and color gamut coverage as well as an extra-long display lifespan,” according to Asus. The monitor lets you toggle between 4K 240Hz or FHD 480Hz, and it also offers “true 10-bit color,” a DisplayPort 2.1a UHBR20 port with 80Gbps of bandwidth, and an HDMI 2.1 port.

The other two monitors, the 34-inch ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDN and the ROG Strix OLED XG34WCDMS, use quantum dot OLED panels with “40% deeper perceived black levels than previous QD-OLED panels.” The PG34WCDN offers a refresh rate of up to 360Hz, while the XG34WCDMS tops out at 280Hz, and both support true 10-bit color. For ports, they have a DisplayPort 1.4 port, a HDMI 2.1 port, and a USB-C port with power delivery (though the PG34WCDN offers 90W power delivery while the XG34WCDMS supports 15W).

Asus isn’t yet sharing specifics about when the monitors will be available outside of saying that they’re “on their way.”

Audeze — the headphone-maker now owned by Sony — announced a refreshed version of its Maxwell gaming headset at CES on Monday, offering roomier ear pads that attach magnetically for easy replacement. The Maxwell 2 for PlayStation is available now for $329, while the Xbox version costs $349, though both support Windows, macOS, Nintendo Switch, and mobile.

Similar to its predecessor, the Maxwell 2 promises up to 80 hours of battery life and comes equipped with 90mm magnetic drivers that deliver a frequency range of 10Hz to 50Hz, “that clearly articulates every detail from the faintest footsteps to the most earth-shattering explosions with near-zero distortion,” according to Audeze.

Some other nice upgrades include a wider strap with ventilation holes, in addition to support for Audeze’s SLAM technology for better-sounding bass. The headphones also have a removable boom microphone that uses AI-powered noise cancellation tech and can connect wirelessly to your device using the included USB-C dongle or Bluetooth 5.3, which includes support for LDAC and LE Audio.

Bosch has announced it’s releasing its first ever cordless stick vacuum in the US, the Bosch Unlimited 10 and 9. While Dyson tends to dominate the conversation in the US, Bosch has long been a major player in Europe, making its debut in the US cordless stick vacuum market a notable one.

Bosch says the vacuums are designed to pick up 99.99 percent of dust, even fine particles you can’t easily see with the naked eye, and automatically adjusts power and performance based on the floor type. Each vacuum also features a bright blue LED ring light that signals when a surface has been fully cleaned. Both models are additionally backed by an industry-leading 10-year motor warranty.

The Unlimited 10 builds on those core features with a few upgrades, including a 90-degree bendable tube for easier cleaning under low furniture and in tight spaces. It also adds a dynamic display for switching between six cleaning modes and offers up to 80 minutes of runtime — about 20 minutes more than the Unlimited 9, Bosch claims.

Pricing starts at $499 for the Unlimited 9 and $599 for the Unlimited 10. Both models are available now on Amazon and through the Bosch Home U.S. website.

            <div id="article-text">A new integration with Amazon’s voice assistant brings hands-free barista-style skills to the countertop coffee maker.

A new integration with Amazon’s voice assistant brings hands-free barista-style skills to the countertop coffee maker.

At CES this week, Bosch announced the launch of its Personal AI Barista, Powered by Alexa Plus, and teased a new AI-powered cooking feature coming to its connected appliances.

Coming to its Bosch 800 Series fully automatic espresso machines, the upgrade allows Alexa users to talk with the machine via an Echo smart speaker “as naturally as speaking to a local barista — customizing drinks, routines, and preferences through conversation,” according to the company.

The Bosch 800 Series is one of only a couple of countertop coffee makers that work with Alexa voice control. I’ve been testing it and have had some trouble getting Alexa Plus to consistently make a cup of coffee with a voice command.

Before Alexa Plus, asking regular Alexa to make me a coffee based on a routine I set up in the Alexa app mostly worked fine. But since the new assistant arrived, Alexa has been frequently confused.

This is an example of one of the biggest challenges of revamping voice assistants with generative AI. The new versions find it harder to do some of the more straightforward tasks their predecessors excelled at.

On the flip side, they should be able to do a lot more. At one point, it seemed companies hoped the AI would just figure it out on its own, but now they are having to set up individual integrations again, just as they did with the original Alexa.

“Using natural language, users may now control every aspect of the already-advanced espresso machine.”

Bosch says engineering teams at Bosch and Amazon “have worked intensely to fully integrate Alexa Plus” with these new capabilities. The company says that when it launches, you should be able to control every aspect of the espresso machine:

“Using natural language, users may now control every aspect of the already-advanced espresso machine to formulate and improve daily coffee routines. The AI assistant leverages its vast knowledge base, along with machine learning, to pass the command to the espresso machine.”

The routine I set up with old Alexa required me to select a specific drink type when I programmed it, limiting me to that type, or I had to set up several routines for each drink I might want to make. With this new Alexa Plus upgrade, it sounds like I should be able to ask it to make any drink from its vast library, and it will know what to do.

That certainly feels more like the experience I expected with Alexa Plus. I’m looking forward to putting this to the test when the integration launches.

Along with AI powers in its coffee machine, Bosch is debuting its Bosch Cook AI at CES. The company says this is “an intelligent new solution that combines agentic artificial intelligence, Bosch’s proprietary appliance technologies, sensors and a unique user experience within the Home Connect app.”

Bosch Cook AI is designed to provide live guidance through the Home Connect app when you’re prepping and cooking to help you prepare more complex meals, such as “cooking multiple steaks to different levels of doneness, simultaneously.” The system can also “intelligently orchestrate multiple Bosch appliances in tandem,” according to the company.

Bosch will be demoing this at CES, and I’ll be on the show floor to check it out.

            <h2>The overlooked driver of digital transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/05/1124662/the-overlooked-driver-of-digital-transformation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When business leaders talk about digital transformation, their focus often jumps straight to cloud platforms, AI tools, or collaboration software. Yet, one of the most fundamental enablers of how organizations now work, and how employees experience that work, is often overlooked: audio.

As Genevieve Juillard, CEO of IDC, notes, the shift to hybrid collaboration made every space, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen tables, meeting-ready almost overnight. In the scramble, audio quality often lagged, creating what research now shows is more than a nuisance. Poor sound can alter how speakers are perceived, making them seem less credible or even less trustworthy.

&quot;Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning,” stresses Julliard. “If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you, and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.&quot; Without clarity, comprehension and confidence collapse.

For Shure, which has spent a century advancing sound technology, the implications extend far beyond convenience. Chris Schyvinck, Shure’s president and CEO, explains that ineffective audio undermines engagement and productivity. Meetings stall, decisions slow, and fatigue builds.

&quot;Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space,&quot; says Juillard. &quot;If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.&quot;

When audio is prioritized on equal footing with video and other collaboration tools, organizations can gain something rare: frictionless communication. That clarity ensures the machines listening in, from AI transcription engines to real-time translation systems, can deliver reliable results.

The research from Shure and IDC highlights two blind spots for leaders. First, buying decisions too often privilege price over quality, with costly consequences in productivity and trust. Second, organizations underestimate the stress poor sound imposes on employees, intensifying the cognitive load of already demanding workdays. Addressing both requires leaders to view audio not as a peripheral expense but as core infrastructure.

Looking ahead, audio is becoming inseparable from AI-driven collaboration. Smarter systems can already filter out background noise, enhance voices in real time, and integrate seamlessly into hybrid ecosystems.

&quot;We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a more equitable meeting experience for people,&quot; says Schyvinck.

For Schyvinck and Juillard, the future belongs to companies that treat audio transformation as an integral part of digital transformation, building workplaces that are more sustainable, equitable, and resilient.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.As companies continue their journeys towards digital transformation, audio modernization is an often overlooked but key component of any successful journey. Clear audio is imperative not only for quality communication, but also for brand equity, both for internal and external stakeholders and even the company as a whole.Two words for you: audio transformation.My guests today are Chris Schyvinck, President and CEO at Shure. And Genevieve Juillard, CEO at IDC.Welcome Chris and Genevieve.

Chris Schyvinck: It&#39;s really nice to be here. Thank you very much.

Genevieve Juillard: Yeah, thank you so much for having us. Great to be here.

Megan Tatum: Thank you both so much for being here. Genevieve, we could start with you. Let&#39;s start with some history perhaps for context. How would you describe the evolution of audio technology and how use cases and our expectations of audio have evolved? What have been some of the major drivers throughout the years and more recently, perhaps would you consider the pandemic to be one of those drivers?

Genevieve: It&#39;s interesting. If you go all the way back to 1976, Norman Macrae of The Economist predicted that video chat would actually kill the office, that people would just work from home. Obviously, that didn&#39;t happen then, but the core technology for remote collaboration has actually been around for decades. But until the pandemic, most of us only experienced it in very specific contexts. Offices had dedicated video conferencing rooms and most ran on expensive proprietary systems. And then almost overnight, everything including literally the kitchen table had to be AV ready. The cultural norms shifted just as fast. Before the pandemic, it was perfectly fine to keep your camera off in a meeting, and now that&#39;s seen as disengaged or even rude, and that changes what normalized video conferencing and my hybrid meetings.

But in a rush to equip a suddenly remote workforce, we hit two big problems. Supply chain disruptions and a massive spike in demand. High-quality gear was hard to get so low-quality audio and video became the default. And here&#39;s a key point. We now know from research that audio quality matters more than video quality for meeting outcomes. You can run a meeting without video, but you can&#39;t run a meeting without clear audio. Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning. If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.

Megan: Oh, true. It&#39;s fascinating, isn&#39;t it? And Chris, Shure and IDC recently released some research titled “The Hidden Influencer Rethinking Audio Could Impact Your Organization Today, Tomorrow, and Forever.” The research highlighted that importance of audio that Genevieve&#39;s talking about in today&#39;s increasingly virtual world. What did you glean from those results and did anything surprise you?

Chris: Yeah, well, the research certainly confirmed a lot of hunches we&#39;ve had through the years. When you think about a company like Shure that&#39;s been doing audio for 100 years, we just celebrated that anniversary this year.

Chris: Our legacy business is over more in the music and performance arena. And so just what Genevieve said in terms of, &quot;Yeah, you can have a performance and look at somebody, but that&#39;s like 10% of it, right? 90% is hearing that person sing, perform, and talk.&quot; We&#39;ve always, of course, from our perspective, understood that clean, clear, crisp audio is what is needed in any setting. When you translate what&#39;s happening on the stage into a meeting or collaboration space at a corporation, we&#39;ve thought that that is just equally as important.

And we always had this hunch that if people don&#39;t have the good audio, they&#39;re going to have fatigue, they&#39;re going to get a little disengaged, and the whole meeting is going to become quite unproductive. The research just really amplified that hunch for us because it really depicted the fact that people not only get kind of frustrated and disengaged, they might actually start to distrust what the other person with bad audio is saying or just cast it in a different light. And the degree to which that frustration becomes almost personal was very surprising to us. Like I said, it validated some hunches, but it really put an exclamation point on it for us.

Megan: And Genevieve, based on the research results, I understand that IDC pulled together some recommendations for organizations. What is it that leaders need to know and what is the biggest blind spot for them to overcome as well?

Genevieve: The biggest blind spot is this. If your microphone has poor audio quality, like Chris said, people will literally perceive you as less intelligent and less trustworthy. And by the way, that&#39;s not an opinion. It&#39;s what the science says. But yet, when we surveyed first time business buyers, the number one factor they used to choose audio gear was price. However, for repeat buyers, the top factor flipped to audio quality. My guess is they learn the lesson the hard way. The second blind spot is to Chris&#39;s point, it&#39;s the stress that bad audio creates. Poor sound forces your brain to work harder to decode what&#39;s being said. That&#39;s a cognitive load and it creates stress. And over a full day of meetings, that stress adds up. Now, we don&#39;t have long-term studies yet on the effects, but we do know that prolonged stress is something that every company should be working to reduce.

Good audio lightens that cognitive load. It keeps people engaged and it levels the playing field. Whether you&#39;re in a room or you&#39;re halfway across the world, and here&#39;s one that&#39;s often overlooked, bad audio can sabotage AI transcription tools. As AI becomes more and more central to everyday work, that starts to become really critical. If your audio isn&#39;t clear, the transcription won&#39;t be accurate. And there&#39;s a world of difference between working, for example, the consulting department and the insulting department, and that is an actual example from the field.

The bottom line is you fix the audio, you cut friction, you save time, and you make meetings more productive.

Megan: I mean, it&#39;s just a huge game changer, isn&#39;t it, really? I mean, and given that, Chris, in your experience across industries, are audio technologies being included in digital transformation strategies and also artificial intelligence implementation? Do we need a separate audio transformation perhaps?

Chris: Well, like I mentioned earlier, yes, people tend to initially focus on that visual platform, but increasingly the attention to audio is really coming into focus. And I&#39;d hate to tear apart audio as a separate sort of strategy because at the same time, we, as an audio expert, are trying to really seamlessly integrate audio into the rest of the ecosystem. It really does need to be put on an equal footing with the rest of the components in that ecosystem. And to Genevieve&#39;s point, as we are seeing audio and video systems with more AI functionalities, the importance of real-time translations that are being used, voice recognition, being able to attribute who said what in a meeting and take action items, it&#39;s really, I think starting to elevate the importance of that clear audio. And it&#39;s got to be part of a comprehensive, really collaboration plan that helps some company figure out what&#39;s their whole digital transformation about. It just really has to be included in that comprehensive plan, but put on equal footing with the rest of the components in that system.

Megan: Yeah, absolutely. And in the broader landscape, Genevieve, in terms of discussing the importance of audio quality, what have you noticed across research projects about the effects of good and bad audio, not only from that company perspective, but from employee and client perspectives as well?

Genevieve: Well, let&#39;s start with employees.

Genevieve: Bad audio adds friction you don&#39;t need, we&#39;ve talked about this. When you&#39;re straining to hear or make sense of what&#39;s being said, your brain is burning energy on decoding instead of contributing. That frustration, it builds up, and by the end of the day, it hurts productivity. From a company perspective, the stakes get even higher. Meetings are where decisions happen or at least where they&#39;re supposed to happen. And if people can&#39;t hear clearly, decisions get delayed, mistakes creep in, and the whole process slows down. Poor audio doesn&#39;t just waste time, it chips away at the ability to move quickly and confidently. And then there&#39;s the client experience. So whether it&#39;s in sales, customer service, or any external conversation, poor audio can make you sound less credible and yet less trustworthy. Again, that&#39;s not my opinion. That&#39;s what the research shows. So that&#39;s quite a big risk when you&#39;re trying to close a deal or solve a major problem.

The takeaway is good audio, it matters, it&#39;s a multiplier. It makes meetings more productive and it can help decisions happen faster and client interactions be stronger.

Megan: It&#39;s just so impactful, isn&#39;t it, in so many different ways. I mean, Chris, how are you seeing these research results reflected as companies work through digital and AI transformations? What is it that leaders need to understand about what is involved in audio implementation across their organization?

Chris: Well, like I said earlier, I do think that audio is finally maybe getting its place in the spotlight a little bit up there with our cousins over in the video side. Audio, it&#39;s not just a peripheral aspect anymore. It&#39;s a very integral part of that sort of comprehensive collaboration plan I was talking about earlier. And when we think about how can we contribute solutions that are really more easy to use for our end users, because if you create something complicated, we were talking about the days gone by of walking into a room. It&#39;s a very complicated system, and you need to find the right person that knows how to run it. Increasingly, you just need to have some plug and play kind of solutions. We&#39;re thinking about a more sustainable strategy for our solutions where we make really high-quality hardware. We&#39;ve done that account for a hundred years. People will come up to me and tell the story of the SM58 microphone they bought in 1980 and how they&#39;re still using it every day.

We know how to do that part of it. If somebody is willing to make that investment upfront, put some high-quality hardware into their system, then we are getting to the point now where updates can be handled via software downloads or cloud connectivity. And just really being able to provide sort of a sustainable solution for people over time.

More in our industry, we&#39;re collaborating with other industry partners to go in that direction, make something that&#39;s very simple for anybody to walk into a room or on their individual at home setup and do something pretty simple. And I think we have the right industry groups, the right industry associations that can help make sure that the ecosystems have the proper standards, the right kind of ways to make sure everything is interoperable within a system. We&#39;re all kind of heading in that direction with that end user in mind.

Megan: Fantastic. And when the internet of things was emerging, efforts began to create sort of these data ecosystems, it seems there&#39;s an argument to be made that we need audio ecosystems as well. I wonder, Chris, what might an audio ecosystem look like and what would be involved in implementation?

Chris: Well, I think it does have to be part of that bigger ecosystem I was just talking about where we do collaborate with others in industry and we try to make sure that we&#39;re all playing by the kind of same set of rules and protocols and standards and whatnot. And when you think about compatibility across all the devices that sit in a room or sit in your, again, maybe your at home setup, making sure that the audio quality is as good as it can be, that you can interoperate with everything else in the system. That&#39;s just become very paramount in our day-to-day work here. Your hardware has to be scalable like I just alluded to a moment ago. You have to figure out how you can integrate with existing technologies, different platforms.

We were joking when we came into this session that when you&#39;re going from the platform at your company, maybe you&#39;re on Teams and you go into a Zoom setting or you go into a Google setting, you really have to figure out how to adapt to all those different sort of platforms that are out there. I think the ecosystem that we&#39;re trying to build, we&#39;re trying to be on that equal footing with the rest of the components in that system. And people really do understand that if you want to have extra functionalities in meetings and you want to be able to transcribe or take notes and all of that, that audio is an absolutely critical piece.

Megan: Absolutely. And speaking of bit of all those different platforms and use cases, that sort of audio is so relevant to Genevieve that goes back to this idea of in audio one size does not fit all and needs may change. How can companies also plan their audio implementations to be flexible enough to meet current needs and to be able to grow with future advancements?

Genevieve: I&#39;m glad you asked this question. Even years after the pandemic, many companies, they&#39;re still trying to get the balance right between remote, in office, how to support it. But even if a company has a strict return to office in-person policy, the reality is that work still isn&#39;t going away for that company. They may have teams across cities or countries, clients and external stakeholders will have their own office preferences that they have to adapt to. Supporting hybrid work is actually becoming more important, not less. And our research shows that companies are leaning into, not away from, hybrid setups. About one third of companies are now redesigning or resizing office spaces every single year. For large organizations with multiple sites, staggered leases, that&#39;s a moving target. It&#39;s really important that they have audio solutions that can work before, during, after all of those changes that they&#39;re constantly making. And so that&#39;s where flexibility becomes really important. Companies need to buy not just for right now, but for the future.

And so here&#39;s IDC&#39;s kind of pro-tip, which is make sure as a company that you go with a provider that offers top-notch audio quality and also has strong partnerships and certifications with the big players and communications technology because that will save you money in the long run. Your systems will stay compatible, your investments will last longer, and you won&#39;t be scrambling when that next shift happens.

Megan: Of course. And speaking of building for the future, as companies begin to include sustainability in their company goals, Chris, I wonder how can audio play a role in those sustainability efforts and how might that play into perhaps the return on investment in building out a high-quality audio ecosystem?

Chris: Well, I totally agree with what Genevieve just said in terms of hybrid work is not going anywhere. You get all of those big headlines that talk about XYZ company telling people to get back into the office. And I saw a fantastic piece of data just last week that showed the percent of in-office hours of the American workers versus out-of-office remote kind of work. It has basically been flatlined since 2022. This is our new way of working. And of course, like Genevieve mentioned, you have people in all these different locations. And in a strange way, living through the pandemic did teach us that we can do some things by not having to hop on an airplane and travel to go somewhere. Certainly that helps with a more sustainable strategy over time, and you&#39;re saving on travel and able to get things done much more quickly.

And then from a product offering perspective, I&#39;ll go back to the vision I was painting earlier where we and others in our industry see that we can create great solid hardware platforms. We&#39;ve done it for decades, and now that advancements around AI and all of our software that enables products and everything else that has happened in the last probably decade, we can get enhancements and additions and new functionality to people in simpler ways on existing hardware. I think we&#39;re all careening down this path of having a much more sustainable ecosystem for all collaboration. It&#39;s really quite an exciting time, and that pays off with any company implementing a system, their ROI is going to be much better in the long run.

Megan: Absolutely. And Genevieve, what trends around sustainability are you seeing? What opportunities do you see for audio to play into those sustainability efforts going forward?

Genevieve: Yeah, similar to Chris. In some industries, there&#39;s still a belief that the best work happens when everyone&#39;s in the same room. And yes, face-to-face time is really important for building relationships, for brainstorming, for closing big deals, but it does come at a cost. The carbon footprint of daily commutes, the sales visits, the constant business travel. And then there&#39;s the basic consideration, as we&#39;ve talked about, of just pure practicality. The good news is with the right AV setup, especially high-quality audio, many of those interactions can happen virtually without losing effectiveness, as Chris said it, but our research shows it.

Our research shows that virtual meetings can be just as productive as in-person ones, and every commute or flight you avoid, of course makes a measurable sustainability impact. I don&#39;t think, personally, that the takeaway is replace all in-person meetings, but instead it&#39;s to be intentional. Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space. If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.

Megan: Such an important point. And let&#39;s close with a future forward look, if we can. Genevieve, what innovations or advancements in the audio field are you most excited to see to come to fruition, and what potential interesting use cases do you see on the horizon?

Genevieve: I&#39;m especially interested in how AI and audio are converging. We&#39;re now seeing AI that can identify and isolate human voices in noisy environments. For example, right now, there are some jets flying overhead. It&#39;s very loud in here, but I suspect you may not even know that that&#39;s happening.

Genevieve: Right. That technology, it&#39;s pulling voices forward so that conversations like ours are crystal clear. And that&#39;s a big deal, especially as companies invest more and more in AI tools, especially for that translating, transcribing and summarizing meetings. But as we&#39;ve talked before, AI is only as good as the audio it hears. If the sound is poor or a word gets misheard, the meaning can shift entirely. And sometimes that&#39;s just inconvenient, or it can even be funny. But in really high stakes settings, like healthcare for example, a single mis-transcribed word can have serious consequences. So that&#39;s why our position as high quality audio is critical and it&#39;s necessary for making AI powered communication accurate, trustworthy, and useful because when the input is clean, the output can actually live up to its promise.

Megan: Fantastic. And Chris, finally, what are you most excited to see developed? What advancements are you most looking forward to seeing?

Chris: Well, I really do believe that this is one of the most exciting times that I know I&#39;ve lived through in my career. Just the pace of how fast technology is moving, the sudden emergence of all things AI. I was actually in a roundtable session of CEOs yesterday from lots of different industries, and the facilitator was talking about change management internally in companies as you&#39;re going through all of these technology shifts and some of the fear that people have around AI and things like that. And the facilitator asked each of us to give one word that describes how we&#39;re feeling right now. And the first CEO that went used the word dread. And that absolutely floored me because you enter into these eras with some skepticism and trying to figure out how to make things work and go down the right path. But my word was truly optimism.

When I look at all the ways that we are able to deliver better audio to people more quickly, there&#39;s so many opportunities in front of us. We&#39;re working on things outside of AI like algorithms that Genevieve just mentioned that filter out the bad sounds that you don&#39;t want entering into a meeting. We&#39;ve been doing that for quite a long time now. There&#39;s also opportunities to do real time audio improvements, enhancements, make audio more personal for people. How do they want to be able to very simply, through voice commands perhaps, adjust their audio? There shouldn&#39;t have to be a whole lot of techie settings that come along with our solutions.

We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a little bit more equitable meeting experience for people. And we&#39;re looking at tech technology solutions around immersive audio. How can you maybe feel like you&#39;re a bit more engaged in the meeting, kind of creating some realistic virtual experiences, if you will. There&#39;s just so many opportunities in front of us, and I can just picture a day when you walk into a room and you tell the room, &quot;Hey, call Genevieve. We&#39;re going to have a meeting for an hour, and we might need to have Megan on call to come in at a certain time.&quot;

And all of this will just be very automatic, very seamless, and we&#39;ll be able to see each other and talk at the same time. And this isn&#39;t years away. This is happening really, really quickly. And I do think it&#39;s a really exciting time for audio and just all together collaboration in our industry.

Megan: Absolutely. Sounds like there&#39;s plenty of reason to be optimistic. Thank you both so much.That was Chris Schyvinck, President and CEO at Shure.

Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change

In June last year, startup Octavia Carbon began running a high-stakes test in the small town of Gilgil in south-central Kenya. It’s harnessing some of the excess energy generated by vast clouds of steam under the Earth’s surface to power prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.The company’s long-term vision is undoubtedly ambitious—it wants to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. On top of that, Kenya’s Maasai people have plenty of reasons to distrust energy companies. Read the full story.

This article is also part of the Big Story series: MIT Technology Review’s most important, ambitious reporting. The stories in the series take a deep look at the technologies that are coming next and what they will mean for us and the world we live in. Check out the rest of them here.

AI Wrapped: The 14 AI terms you couldn’t avoid in 2025

If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. Our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse. Read the full list.

MIT Technology Review’s most popular stories of 2025

2025 was a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.As the new year begins, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit some of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

How aging clocks can help us understand why we age—and if we can reverse itWrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. And what they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself. Read the full story.—Jessica Hamzelou

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In an industry in constant flux, sticking your neck out to predict what’s coming next may seem reckless. (AI bubble? What AI bubble?) But for the last few years we’ve done just that—and we’re doing it again.

How did we do last time? We picked five hot AI trends to look out for in 2025, including what we called generative virtual playgrounds, a.k.a world models (check: From Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 to World Labs’s Marble, tech that can generate realistic virtual environments on the fly keeps getting better and better); so-called reasoning models (check: Need we say more? Reasoning models have fast become the new paradigm for best-in-class problem solving); a boom in AI for science (check: OpenAI is now following Google DeepMind by setting up a dedicated team to focus on just that); AI companies that are cozier with national security (check: OpenAI reversed position on the use of its technology for warfare to sign a deal with the defense-tech startup Anduril to help it take down battlefield drones); and legitimate competition for Nvidia (check, kind of: China is going all in on developing advanced AI chips, but Nvidia’s dominance still looks unassailable—for now at least).

So what’s coming in 2026? Here are our big bets for the next 12 months.

The last year shaped up as a big one for Chinese open-source models. In January, DeepSeek released R1, its open-source reasoning model, and shocked the world with what a relatively small firm in China could do with limited resources. By the end of the year, “DeepSeek moment” had become a phrase frequently tossed around by AI entrepreneurs, observers, and builders—an aspirational benchmark of sorts.

It was the first time many people realized they could get a taste of top-tier AI performance without going through OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

Open-weight models like R1 allow anyone to download a model and run it on their own hardware. They are also more customizable, letting teams tweak models through techniques like distillation and pruning. This stands in stark contrast to the “closed” models released by major American firms, where core capabilities remain proprietary and access is often expensive.

As a result, Chinese models have become an easy choice. Reports by CNBC and Bloomberg suggest that startups in the US have increasingly recognized and embraced what they can offer.

One popular group of models is Qwen, created by Alibaba, the company behind China’s largest e-commerce platform, Taobao. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct alone has 8.85 million downloads, making it one of the most widely used pretrained LLMs. The Qwen family spans a wide range of model sizes alongside specialized versions tuned for math, coding, vision, and instruction-following, a breadth that has helped it become an open-source powerhouse.

Other Chinese AI firms that were previously unsure about committing to open source are following DeepSeek’s playbook. Standouts include Zhipu’s GLM and Moonshot’s Kimi. The competition has also pushed American firms to open up, at least in part. In August, OpenAI released its first open-source model. In November, the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based nonprofit, released its latest open-source model, Olmo 3.

Even amid growing US-China antagonism, Chinese AI firms’ near-unanimous embrace of open source has earned them goodwill in the global AI community and a long-term trust advantage. In 2026, expect more Silicon Valley apps to quietly ship on top of Chinese open models, and look for the lag between Chinese releases and the Western frontier to keep shrinking—from months to weeks, and sometimes less.

T​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.

Under Trump’s executive order, states may fear being sued or starved federal funding if they clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. Big Democratic states like California—which just enacted the nation’s first frontier AI law requiring companies to publish safety testing for their AI models—will take the fight to court, arguing that only Congress can override state laws. But states that can’t afford to lose federal funding, or fear getting in Trump’s crosshairs, might fold. Still, expect to see more state lawmaking on hot-button issues, especially where Trump’s order gives states a green light to legislate. With chatbots accused of triggering teen suicides and data centers sucking up more and more energy, states will face mounting public pressure to push for guardrails.

In place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law. Don’t count on it. Congress failed to pass a moratorium on state legislation twice in 2025, and we aren’t holding out hope that it will deliver its own bill this year.

AI companies like OpenAI and Meta will continue to deploy powerful super-PACs to support political candidates who back their agenda and target those who stand in their way. On the other side, super-PACs supporting AI regulation will build their own war chests to counter. Watch them duke it out at next year’s midterm elections.

The further AI advances, the more people will fight to steer its course, and 2026 will be another year of regulatory tug-of-war—with no end in sight.

Imagine a world in which you have a personal shopper at your disposal 24-7—an expert who can instantly recommend a gift for even the trickiest-to-buy-for friend or relative, or trawl the web to draw up a list of the best bookcases available within your tight budget. Better yet, they can analyze a kitchen appliance’s strengths and weaknesses, compare it with its seemingly identical competition, and find you the best deal. Then once you’re happy with their suggestion, they’ll take care of the purchasing and delivery details too.But this ultra-knowledgeable shopper isn’t a clued-up human at all—it’s a chatbot. This is no distant prediction, either. Salesforce recently said it anticipates that AI will drive $263 billion in online purchases this holiday season. That’s some 21% of all orders. And experts are betting on AI-enhanced shopping becoming even bigger business within the next few years. By 2030, between $3 trillion and $5 trillion annually will be made from agentic commerce, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey.

Unsurprisingly, AI companies are already heavily invested in making purchasing through their platforms as frictionless as possible. Google’s Gemini app can now tap into the company’s powerful Shopping Graph data set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a ChatGPT shopping feature capable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.

Expect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.

I’m going to hedge here, right out of the gate. It’s no secret that large language models spit out a lot of nonsense. Unless it’s with monkeys-and-typewriters luck, LLMs won’t discover anything by themselves. But LLMs do still have the potential to extend the bounds of human knowledge.

We got a glimpse of how this could work in May, when Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve, a system that used the firm’s Gemini LLM to come up with new algorithms for solving unsolved problems. The breakthrough was to combine Gemini with an evolutionary algorithm that checked its suggestions, picked the best ones, and fed them back into the LLM to make them even better.

Google DeepMind used AlphaEvolve to come up with more efficient ways to manage power consumption by data centers and Google’s TPU chips. Those discoveries are significant but not game-changing. Yet. Researchers at Google DeepMind are now pushing their approach to see how far it will go.

And others have been quick to follow their lead. A week after AlphaEvolve came out, Asankhaya Sharma, an AI engineer in Singapore, shared OpenEvolve, an open-source version of Google DeepMind’s tool. In September, the Japanese firm Sakana AI released a version of the software called SinkaEvolve. And in November, a team of US and Chinese researchers revealed AlphaResearch, which they claim improves on one of AlphaEvolve’s already better-than-human math solutions.

There are alternative approaches too. For example, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver are trying to make LLMs more inventive by tweaking the way so-called reasoning models work. They have drawn on what cognitive scientists know about creative thinking in humans to push reasoning models toward solutions that are more outside the box than their typical safe-bet suggestions.

Hundreds of companies are spending billions of dollars looking for ways to get AI to crack unsolved math problems, speed up computers, and come up with new drugs and materials. Now that AlphaEvolve has shown what’s possible with LLMs, expect activity on this front to ramp up fast.

For a while, lawsuits against AI companies were pretty predictable: Rights holders like authors or musicians would sue companies that trained AI models on their work, and the courts generally found in favor of the tech giants. AI’s upcoming legal battles will be far messier.

The fights center on thorny, unresolved questions: Can AI companies be held liable for what their chatbots encourage people to do, as when they help teens plan suicides? If a chatbot spreads patently false information about you, can its creator be sued for defamation? If companies lose these cases, will insurers shun AI companies as clients?

In 2026, we’ll start to see the answers to these questions, in part because some notable cases will go to trial (the family of a teen who died by suicide will bring OpenAI to court in November).

At the same time, the legal landscape will be further complicated by President Trump’s executive order from December—see Michelle’s item above for more details on the brewing regulatory storm.

No matter what, we’ll see a dizzying array of lawsuits in all directions (not to mention some judges even turning to AI amid the deluge).

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano’s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.

Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there’s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It’s why my favorites are Garrido’s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine. Check out his version of Skrillex and Missy Elliot’s “Ra Ta Ta” and tell me it doesn’t put happiness in your heart.

Watching Sora ­videos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.

In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing,” Atkins has said. “I want everything I make to corpse.” Next to Atkins’s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive.

What’s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay’s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you’d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don’t even make any sense.

With everybody now talking to their computers, McKay’s book resets the anthropomorphic trap we’ve all fallen into. It’s a brilliant evocation of what a nonhuman mind might contain—and a meditation on the hard limits of communication.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <h2>Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129416/head-transplant-surgeon-sergio-canavero-future-job/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.

Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent. The Chicago Tribune labeled him the “P.T. Barnum of transplantation.”

Canavero withdrew from the spotlight. But the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups.

It’s been rocky. After he began publishing his surgical ideas a decade ago, Canavero says, he got his “pink slip” from the Molinette Hospital in Turin, where he’d spent 22 years on staff. “I’m an out-of-the-establishment guy. So that has made things harder, I have to say,” he says.

No other solution to aging is on the horizon. “It’s become absolutely clear over the past years that the idea of some incredible tech to rejuvenate elderly people—­happening in some secret lab, like Google—is really going nowhere,” he says. “You have to go for the whole shebang.”

He means getting a new body, not just one new organ. Canavero has an easy mastery of English idioms and an unexpected Southern twang. He says that’s due to a fascination with American comics as a child. “For me, learning the language of my heroes was paramount,” he says. “So I can shoot the breeze.”

Canavero is now an independent investigator and has advised entrepreneurs who want to create brainless human clones as a source of DNA-matched organs that wouldn’t get rejected by a recipient’s immune system. “I can tell you there are guys from top universities involved,” he says.

Combining the necessary technologies, like reliably precise surgical robots and artificial wombs to grow the clones, is going to be complex and very, very expensive. Canavero lacks the funds to take his plans further, but he believes “the money is out there” for a commercial moonshot project: “What I say to the billionaires is ‘Come together.’ You will all have your own share, plus make yourselves immortal.”

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

Yes, you can pay $50,000 to clone a pet. But others are using the technology to rescue endangered species.

            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
