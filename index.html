            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A day after NASA officials expressed optimism that they could be ready to launch the Artemis II mission around the Moon next month, the space agency’s administrator announced Saturday that a new problem will require the removal of the rocket from its launch pad in Florida.

The latest issue appeared Friday evening, when data showed an interruption in helium flow into the upper stage of the Space Launch System rocket, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman wrote in a post on X. Isaacman posted a more thorough update Saturday, writing that engineers are still examining the potential cause of the problem, but any fixes must take place inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.

That means NASA and contractor ground teams will immediately begin preparing to roll the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) SLS rocket off of Launch Complex 39B and back to the VAB. The rocket and its mobile launch platform will ride NASA’s crawler-transporter for the 4-mile journey.

“Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” Isaacman wrote. “As mentioned previously, we will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration. I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor.”

NASA officials were eyeing a launch attempt for Artemis II as soon as March 6, the first of five launch opportunities available in March. There are approximately five days per month that the mission can depart the Earth after accounting for the position of the Moon in its orbit, the flight’s trajectory, and thermal and lighting constraints. The next series of launch dates begin April 1.

The space agency bypassed launch opportunities earlier this month after a fueling test on the SLS rocket revealed a hydrogen leak. After replacing seals in the fueling line leading into the SLS core stage, NASA completed a second fueling test Thursday with no significant leaks, raising hopes the mission could take off next month. With the discovery of the helium issue Friday night, the March launch dates are now off the table.

The helium system on the SLS upper stage—officially known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS)—performed well during both of the Artemis II countdown rehearsals. “Last evening, the team was unable to get helium flow through the vehicle. This occurred during a routine operation to repressurize the system,” Isaacman wrote.

Helium is used to purge the upper stage engine and pressurize its propellant tanks. The rocket is in a “safe configuration,” with a backup system providing purge air to the upper stage, NASA said in a statement.

NASA encountered a similar failure signature during preparations for launch of the first SLS rocket on the Artemis I mission in 2022. On Artemis I, engineers traced the problem to a failed check valve on the upper stage that needed replacement. NASA officials are not sure yet whether the helium issue Friday was caused by a similar valve failure, a problem with an umbilical interface between the rocket and the launch tower, or a fault with a filter, according to Isaacman.

In any case, technicians are unable to reach the problem area with the rocket at the launch pad. Inside the VAB, ground teams will extend work platforms around the rocket to provide physical access to the upper stage and its associated umbilical connections.

NASA said moving into preparations for rollback now will allow managers to potentially preserve the April launch window, “pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.”

It’s not clear if NASA will perform another fueling test on the SLS rocket after it returns to Launch Pad 39B, or whether technicians will do any more work on the delicate hydrogen umbilical near the bottom of the rocket responsible for recurring leaks during the Artemis I and Artemis II launch campaigns. Managers were pleased with the performance of newly-installed seals during Thursday’s countdown demonstration, but NASA officials have previously said vibrations from transporting the rocket to and from the pad could damage the seals.

“That rollout environment is very complicated,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator, earlier this month. “We think that’s a contributor.”

NASA is also expected to replace batteries on the rocket’s flight termination system inside the VAB. The destruct system batteries currently on the rocket will expire next month.

Artemis II will be the first human spaceflight mission to the vicinity of the Moon since 1972, and also marks the first time astronauts will fly aboard NASA’s SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. Astronaut Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen entered NASA’s standard preflight medical quarantine Friday. Now, they will be released to resume normal training activities.

Artemis II is a precursor for follow-on missions that will target landings at the Moon’s south pole. NASA aims to land the first Artemis mission on the Moon by 2028, but the schedule comes with uncertainties, such as the availability of a human-rated lander, spacesuits, and the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. A successful, and timely, Artemis II mission would help demonstrate that the SLS rocket and Orion will be ready.

With questions about the readiness of nearly every element of the Artemis program for a Moon landing mission, Isaacman teased a “more extensive briefing” on Artemis II and NASA’s broader lunar program later this week.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When dinosaur fossils surface at a site, it is often not possible to tell how many millions of years ago their bones were buried. While the different strata of sedimentary rock represent periods of geologic history frozen in time, accurately dating them or the fossils trapped within them has frequently proven to be frustrating.

Fossilized bones and teeth have been dated with some success before, but that success is inconsistent and depends on the specimens. Both fossilization and the process of sediment turning to rock can alter the bone in ways that interfere with accuracy. While uranium-lead dating is among the most widely used methods for dating materials, it is just an emerging technology when applied to directly dating fossils.

Dinosaur eggshells might have finally cracked a way to date surrounding rocks and fossils. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker of Stellenbosch University, a team of researchers has devised a method of dating eggshells that reveals how long ago they were covered in what was once sand, mud, or other sediments. That information will give the burial time of any other fossils embedded in the same layer of rock.

“If validated, this approach could greatly expand the range of continental sedimentary successions amenable to radioisotopic dating,” Tucker said in a study recently published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

Vertebrates have been laying calcified eggs for hundreds of millions of years (although the first dinosaur eggs had soft shells). What makes fossil eggshells so useful for figuring out the age of other fossils is the unique microstructure of calcium carbonate found in them. The way its crystals are arranged capture a record of diagenetic changes, or physical and chemical changes that occurred during fossilization. These can include water damage, along with breaks and fissures caused by being compacted between layers of sediment. This makes it easier to screen for these signs when trying to determine how old they are.

Eggs from two different Cretaceous sites were sampled. The first came from the Deep Eddy site in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah, which is surrounded by beds of petrified volcanic ash that had already been dated. The second group of samples came from egg clutches that had more recently been unearthed from the Teen Ulaan Chaltsai region of Mongolia’s Eastern Gobi Basin. The age of these eggs and the site they emerged from had previously been estimated but remained unknown.

Tucker and his team used uranium-lead radioisotopic dating on both sets of samples. This method can accurately date rocks that are anywhere from 1 million years old to those as ancient as the Earth itself, going back about 4.5 billion years.

Eggshells and other carbonate materials trap isotopes of lead and uranium. Uranium isotopes are unstable. Over time, they go through radioactive decay, releasing energy and losing protons and neutrons. One particular isotope decays via a pathway that ends with a lead isotope that is much more stable. The amount of lead keeps increasing in a way that’s proportional to the gradual decay of uranium. Finding out the relative amounts of these isotopes and taking their half-lives into account yields a sample’s age.

The eggs from Utah are thought to have been laid by a species of oviraptor, likely Macroelongatoolithus carlylei, while the Mongolian eggs were possibly laid by a Mongolian microtroodontid dinosaur—small, birdlike theropods that have been found to share ancestry with extant birds.

Trace element analysis showed that, despite being found on opposite sides of the planet, the structure of both eggshell samples was amazingly well preserved. There were only a few microfractures caused by the pressure of sedimentary layers packed above them as they fossilized.

After they determined an age for both shell samples by dating them directly, the researchers compared them. Zircons in the sediments of the Deep Eddy site had already established its age. It turned out that the nest site where the clutch of dinosaur eggs had been trapped between strata of volcanic rock dated as slightly older than the eggshells, which this method determined were 95 million years old. As expected, the rock found beneath the clutch was older, while the rock above was younger. The researchers think it is possible that fractures on these eggs may have resulted in slight inaccuracies.

As for the Mongolian eggs, the age from uranium-lead dating was also extremely close to that of the bedrock.

An analysis of trace elements in the Teen Ulaan Chaltsai eggs also turned up a surprise: A meteor had probably fallen to Earth around the time they were buried 99 million years ago. If there had been no meteor impact at the time, there must have already been meteor dust in the sediment that covered them.

“This study demonstrates that eggshell biocalcite from non-avian dinosaurs, birds, and other egg-laying vertebrates has the potential to serve as a reliable geochronometer in Mesozoic and Cenozoic terrestrial sedimentary basins,” Tucker said.

Next time a fossil site of indeterminate age confounds paleontologists, they need only look for dinosaur eggs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Daphne O. Martschenko and Sam Trejo both want to make the world a better, fairer, more equitable place. But they disagree on whether studying social genomics—elucidating any potential genetic contributions to behaviors ranging from mental illnesses to educational attainment to political affiliation—can help achieve this goal.

Martschenko’s argument is largely that genetic research and data have almost always been used thus far as a justification to further entrench extant social inequalities. But we know the solutions to many of the injustices in our world—trying to lift people out of poverty, for example—and we certainly don’t need more genetic research to implement them. Trejo’s point is largely that more information is generally better than less. We can’t foresee the benefits that could come from basic research, and this research is happening anyway, whether we like it or not, so we may as well try to harness it as best we can toward good and not ill.

Obviously, they’re both right. In What We Inherit: How New Technologies and Old Myths Are Shaping Our Genomic Future, we get to see how their collaboration can shed light on our rapidly advancing genetic capabilities.

Trejo is a (quantitative) sociologist at Princeton; Martschenko is a (qualitative) bioethicist at Stanford. He’s a he, and she’s a she; he looks white, she looks black; he’s East Coast, she’s West. On the surface, it seems clear that they would hold different opinions. But they still chose to spend 10 years writing this book in an “adversarial collaboration.” While they still disagree, by now at least they can really listen to and understand each other. In today’s world, that seems pretty worthwhile in and of itself.

The titular “What we inherit” refers to both actual DNA (Trejo’s field) and the myths surrounding it (Martschenko’s). There are two “genetic myths” that most concern them. One is the Destiny Myth: the notion, first promulgated by Francis Galton in his 1869 book Heredity Genius, that the effects of DNA can be separable from the effects of environment. He didn’t deny the effects of nurture; he just erroneously pitted it against nature, as if it were one versus the other instead of each impacting and working through the other. (The most powerful “genetic” determinant of educational attainment in his world was a Y chromosome.) His ideas reached their apotheosis in the forced sterilizations of the eugenics movement in the early 20th century in the US and, eventually, in the policies of Nazi Germany.

The other genetic myth the authors address is the Race Myth, “the false belief that DNA differences divide humans into discrete and biologically distinct racial groups.” (Humans can be genetically sorted by ancestry, but that’s not quite the same thing.) But they spend most of the book discussing polygenic scores, which sum up the impact of lots of small genetic influences. They cover what they are, their strengths and weaknesses, their past, present, and potential uses, and how and how much their use should be regulated. And of course, their ultimate question: Are they worth generating and studying at all?

One thing they agree on is that science education in this country is abysmal and needs to be improved immediately. Most people’s knowledge of genetics is stuck at Mendel and his green versus yellow, smooth versus wrinkled peas: dominant and recessive traits with manifestations that can be neatly traced in Punnet squares. Alas, most human traits are much more complicated than that, especially the interesting ones.

Polygenic scores tally the contributions of many genes to particular traits to predict certain outcomes. There’s no single gene for height, depression, or heart disease; there are a bunch of genes that each make very small contributions to making an outcome more or less likely. Polygenic scores can’t tell you that someone will drop out of high school or get a PhD; they can just tell you that someone might be slightly more or less likely to do so. They are probabilistic, not deterministic, because people’s mental health and educational attainment and, yes, even height, are determined by environmental factors as well as genes.

Polygenic scores, besides only giving predictions, are (a) not that accurate by nature; (b) become less accurate for each trait if you select for more than one trait, like height and intelligence; and (c) are less accurate for those not of European descent, since most genetic studies have thus far been done only with Europeans. So right out of the gate, any potential benefits of the technology will be distributed unevenly.

Another thing that Martschenko and Trejo agree on is that the generation, sale, and use of polygenic scores must be regulated much more assiduously than they currently are to ensure that they are implemented responsibly and equitably. “While scientists and policymakers are guarding the front gate against gene editing, genetic embryo selection (using polygenic scores) is slipping in through the backdoor,” they write. Potential parents using IVF have long been able to choose which embryos to implant based on gender and the presence of very clearcut genetic markers for certain serious diseases. Now, they can choose which embryos they want to implant based on their polygenic scores.

In 2020, a company called Genomic Prediction started offering genomic scores for diabetes, skin cancer, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, intellectual disability, and “idiopathic short stature.” They’ve stopped advertising the last two “because it’s too controversial.” Not, mind you, because the effects are minor and the science is unreliable. The theoretical maximum polygenic score for height would make a difference of 2.5 inches, and that theoretical maximum has not been seen yet, even in studies of Europeans. Polygenic scores for most other traits lag far behind. (And that’s just one company; another called Herasight has since picked up the slack and claims to offer embryo selection based on intelligence.)

Remember, the more traits one selects for, the less accurate each prediction is. Moreover, many genes affect multiple biological processes, so a gene implicated in one undesirable trait may have as yet undefined impacts on other desirable ones.

And all of this is ignoring the potential impact of the child’s environment. The first couple who used genetic screening for their daughter opted for an embryo that had a reduced risk of developing heart disease; her risk was less than 1 percent lower than the three embryos they rejected. Feeding her vegetables and sticking her on a soccer team would have been cheaper and probably more impactful.

Almost every family I know has a kid who has taken growth hormones, and plenty of them get tutoring, too. These interventions are hardly equitably distributed. But if embryos are selected based on polygenic scores, the authors fear that a new form of social inequality can arise. While growth hormone injections affect only one individual, embryonic selection based on polygenic scores affects all of that embryo’s descendants going forward. So the chosen embryos’ progeny could eventually end up treated as a new class of optimized people whose status might be elevated simply because their parents could afford to comb through their embryonic genomes—regardless of whether their “genetic” capabilities are actually significantly different from everyone else’s.

While it is understandable that parents want to give their kids the best chance of success, eliminating traits that they find objectionable will make humanity as a whole more uniform and society as a whole poorer for the lack of heterogeneity. Everyone can benefit from exposure to people who are different from them; if everyone is bred to be tall, smart, and good-looking, how will we learn to tolerate otherness?

Polygenic embryo selection is currently illegal in the UK, Israel, and much of Europe. In 2024, the FDA made some noise about planning to regulate the market, but for now companies offering polygenic scores to the public fall under the same nonmedical category as nutritional supplements—i.e. not regulatable. These companies advertise scores for traits like musical ability and acrophobia, but only for “wellness” or “educational” purposes.

So Americans are largely at the mercy of corporations that want to profit off of them at least as much as they claim to want to help them. And because this is still in the private sector, people who have the most social and environmental advantages—wealthy people with European ancestry—are often the only ones who can afford to try to give their kids any genetic advantages that might be had, further entrenching those social inequalities and potentially creating genetic inequalities that didn’t exist before. Hopefully, these parents will just be funding the snake-oil phase of the process so that if we can ever generate enough data to make polygenic scores actually reliable at predicting anything meaningful, they will be inexpensive enough to be accessible to anyone who wants them.</div>

            <h2>Major government research lab appears to be squeezing out foreign scientists</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/major-government-research-lab-appears-to-be-squeezing-out-foreign-scientists/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the US government’s top scientific research labs is taking steps that could drive away foreign scientists, a shift lawmakers and sources tell WIRED could cost the country valuable expertise and damage the agency’s credibility.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) helps determine the frameworks underpinning everything from cybersecurity to semiconductor manufacturing. Some of NIST’s recent work includes establishing guidelines for securing AI systems and identifying health concerns with air purifiers and firefighting gloves. Many of the agency’s thousands of employees, postdoctoral scientists, contractors, and guest researchers are brought in from around the world for their specialized expertise.

“For weeks now, rumors of draconian new measures have been spreading like wildfire, while my staff’s inquiries to NIST have gone unanswered,” Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, wrote in a letter sent to acting NIST Director Craig Burkhardt on Thursday. April McClain Delaney, a fellow Democrat on the committee, cosigned the message.

Lofgren wrote that while her staff has heard about multiple rumored changes, what they have confirmed through unnamed sources is that the Trump administration “has begun taking steps to limit the ability of foreign-born researchers to conduct their work at NIST.”

The congressional letter follows a Boulder Reporting Lab article on February 12 that said international graduate students and postdoctoral researchers would be limited to a maximum of three years at NIST going forward, despite many of them needing five to seven years to complete their work.

A NIST employee tells WIRED that some plans to bring on foreign workers through the agency’s Professional Research and Experience Program have recently been canceled because of uncertainty about whether they would make it through the new security protocols. The staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says the agency has yet to widely communicate what the new hurdles will be or why it believes they are justified.

On Thursday, the Colorado Sun reported that “noncitizens” lost after-hours access to a NIST lab last month and could soon be banned from the facility entirely.

Jennifer Huergo, a spokesperson for NIST, tells WIRED that the proposed changes are aimed at protecting US science from theft and abuse, echoing a similar statement issued this week to other media outlets. Huergo declined to comment on who needs to approve the proposal for it to be finalized and when a decision will be made. She also didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers’ letter.

Preventing foreign adversaries from stealing valuable American intellectual property has been a bipartisan priority, with NIST among the agencies in recent years to receive congressional scrutiny about the adequacy of its background checks and security policies. Just last month, Republican lawmakers renewed calls to put restrictions in place preventing Chinese nationals from working at or with national labs run by the Department of Energy.

But Lofgren’s letter contends that the rumored restrictions on non-US scientists at NIST go beyond “what is reasonable and appropriate to protect research security.” The letter demands transparency about new policies by February 26 and a pause on them “until Congress can weigh in on whether these changes are necessary at all.”

The potential loss of research talent at NIST would add to a series of other Trump administration policies that some US tech industry leaders have warned will dismantle the lives of immigrant researchers already living in the US and hamper economic growth. Hiking fees on H-1B tech visas, revoking thousands of student visas, and carrying out legally dubious mass deportations all stand to push people eager to work on science and tech research in the US to go elsewhere instead. The Trump administration has also announced plans to limit post-graduation job training for international students.

Pat Gallagher, who served as the director of NIST from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, says the changes could erode trust in the agency, which has long provided the technical foundations that industry and governments around the world rely on. “What has made NIST special is it is scientifically credible,” he tells WIRED. “Industry, universities, and the global measurement community knew they could work with NIST.”

Like much of the federal government, NIST has been in turmoil for most of the past year. Parts of it were paralyzed for months as rumors of DOGE cuts spread. Ultimately, the agency lost hundreds of its thousands of workers to budget cuts, with further funding pressure to come.

As of a couple of years ago, NIST welcomed 800 researchers on average annually from outside the US to work in its offices and collaborate directly with staff.

Lofgren expressed fear that rumors may be enough to scare away researchers and undermine US competitiveness in vital research. “Our scientific excellence depends upon attracting the best and brightest from around the world,” she wrote in the letter.

            <h2>After fueling test, optimism grows for March launch of Artemis II to the Moon</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-reports-no-significant-leaks-in-artemis-ii-fueling-test-eyes-march-6-launch/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A second fueling test on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket ended Thursday night, giving senior managers enough confidence to move forward with plans to launch four astronauts around the Moon as soon as March 6.

Unlike the first attempt to load propellants into the SLS rocket on February 2, there were no major leaks during Thursday’s practice countdown at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Technicians swapped seals at the launch pad after hydrogen gas leaked from the rocket’s main fueling line earlier this month. This time, the seals held.

“For the most part, those fixes all performed pretty well yesterday,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA’s exploration programs. “We were able to fully fuel the SLS rocket within the planned timeline.”

The results keep the Artemis II mission on track for liftoff as soon as next month. NASA gave up on a series of February launch opportunities after encountering a persistent hydrogen leak during the first Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR).

“We’re now targeting March 6 as our earliest launch attempt,” Glaze said. “I am going to caveat that. I want to be open, transparent with all of you that there is still pending work. There’s work, a lot of forward work, that remains.”

If teams complete all of that work, liftoff of the Artemis II mission could occur within a two-hour window opening at 8:29 pm EST on March 6 (01:29 UTC on March 7). NASA has other launch dates available on March 7, 8, 9, and 11, but the mission may have to wait until April. There are approximately five days per month that the mission can depart the Earth after accounting for the position of the Moon in its orbit, the flight’s trajectory, and thermal and lighting constraints.

The Artemis II mission will last between nine and 10 days, taking NASA’s Orion spacecraft with commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen around the far side of the Moon before returning to Earth for splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Wiseman’s crew will set the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth, and will become the first people to fly to the vicinity of the Moon since 1972.

Artemis II is a precursor for follow-in missions that will target landings at the Moon’s south pole. NASA aims to land the first Artemis mission on the Moon by 2028, but the schedule comes with uncertainties, such as the readiness of a human-rated lander, spacesuits, and the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. A successful Artemis II mission would help demonstrate that the SLS rocket and Orion will be ready.

“The excitement for Artemis II is really, really starting to build,” Glaze said. “We can really start to feel it. It’s coming.”

But getting to launch day for Artemis II has not been smooth sailing for NASA. The mission’s first fueling test ran several hours behind schedule on February 2. The launch team paused loading propellant into the rocket after identifying a leak in the connection where supercold liquid hydrogen flows from the launch platform into the SLS core stage.

Sensors near the connection detected hydrogen concentrations exceeding NASA’s safety limit of 16 percent during the first countdown rehearsal. The launch team temporarily contained the leak within limits by stopping and restarting the flow of hydrogen, but the hydrogen leak again tripped the safety threshold as the core stage fuel tank began to pressurize in the final 10 minutes of the countdown.

NASA called an end to the test, drained propellants from the rocket, and ordered workers to replace seals on the fueling umbilical, setting up for the second WDR this week. This time, the hydrogen sensors topped out at 1.6 percent, about one-tenth of NASA’s limit.

Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s Artemis II launch director, said her team saw “very good performance” from the hydrogen seals on Thursday. The countdown ran close to the planned schedule, allowing the launch team to complete two runs through the final 10-minute terminal countdown sequence before ending the test at T-minus 29 seconds.

“When we wrapped all that up, we still had launch window remaining,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “So, very successful day. I’m very proud of this team and all that they accomplished to get us to yesterday and then to go execute with such precision.”

Engineers will spend the next few days examining all the data from Thursday’s countdown. Several other issues popped up during the test. The launch team overcame a communications problem and briefly paused the countdown to assess a potential issue with a booster avionics system. Blackwell-Thompson said engineers will continue assessing the avionics system to ensure it is ready for launch.

“So far, we don’t have any indications of anything that we’re worried about, but we’re just getting started [with the data review],” said John Honeycutt, NASA’s chair of the Artemis II Mission Management Team. “So, we’ll go through that and see what the teams come up with and address those as needed, but overall, it was a good day for us.”

There is no guarantee, of course, that the hydrogen seals will work as well the next time NASA fuels the SLS rocket. The seals, made of Teflon, have a history of fickleness. NASA encountered persistent hydrogen leaks ahead of the launch of the first SLS rocket on the Artemis I mission 2022.

But the seals worked better on Thursday than they did during any of the prior fueling operations. There are no plans to go in and replace them again before launch. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” Honeycutt said.

The “forward work” ahead for the Artemis II team includes a Flight Readiness Review late next week, when senior agency leaders will convene to formally certify the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for flight. Over the next few days, technicians at Kennedy Space Center will retest the rocket’s range safety destruct system.

The Artemis II astronauts entered NASA’s standard two-week-long preflight medical quarantine on Friday at their home base in Houston. Wiseman and his crewmates will fly to Florida about five to seven days before launch.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft Executive Vice President for Gaming Phil Spencer announced he will retire after 38 years at Microsoft and 12 years leading the company’s video game efforts. Asha Sharma, an executive currently in charge of Microsoft’s CoreAI division, will take his place.

Xbox President Sarah Bond, who many assumed was being groomed as Spencer’s eventual replacement, is also resigning from the company. Current Xbox Studios Head Matt Booty, meanwhile, is being promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer and will work closely with Sharma.

In his departure note, Spencer said he told Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last fall that he was “thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.” Spencer will remain at Microsoft “in an advisory role” through the summer to help Sharma during the transition, he wrote.

Spencer, who got his start at Microsoft as an intern in 1988, served as a manager and executive at Microsoft Game Studios in 2003. In 2014, he took over as Head of Xbox, guiding the company through the aftermath of the troubled, Kinect-bundled launch of the Xbox One. More recently, he helped shepherd the company’s 2020 purchase of Bethesda Softworks and its $68.7 billion merger with Activision Blizzard, including the many regulatory battles that followed that latter announcement.

Sharma, who joined Microsoft just two years ago after stints at Meta and Instacart, promised in an introductory message to preside over “the return of Xbox,” and a “recommit[ment] to our core fans and players.” That commitment would “start with console which has shaped who we are,” but expand “across PC, mobile, and cloud,” Sharma wrote.

Sharma also promised the company would “invent new business models and new ways to play,” without treating its core gaming properties “as static IP to milk and monetize.” And despite Sharma’s history of managing AI products at Microsoft, she drew a line in the sand against certain types of machine-generated content.

“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,” Sharma promised. “Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”

Nadella said that he is still “long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition” amid the executive moves. “I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.”

The executive shakeup comes at a delicate time for an Xbox brand that debuted nearly 25 years ago. Amid cratering sales for Xbox hardware, Microsoft has recently been pivoting its gaming business to be less dependent on console exclusives and less focused on dedicated game consoles in general. Last year, in the wake of the Windows-free Steam Deck, Microsoft extended its branding to the Xbox ROG Ally line of Windows-based, gaming-focused portables.

While Microsoft still promises that a new, dedicated Xbox console is in the works, what form it will take is a matter of public speculation. In an October interview with Japan’s Famitsu magazine, Spencer pointed to the Xbox ROG Ally as an example of how the “Xbox software platform will evolve in the future, connecting all devices at one point.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Looking at the state of labor in the US, it can be hard to believe that 35 percent of all workers once belonged to a union. That was back in the 1940s, the peak of American organized labor. Since then, unions have been systematically neutered by corporate lobbying, hostile legislation, and half-century of manufactured consent about the virtues of the free market.

It might be hard to imagine it regaining that former glory, but according to some labor experts, the threat of AI might be what finally forces the issue — as a potentially existential threat to workers’ livelihoods that could unite them against a common enemy.

In an interview with the Guardian, Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s vice-president of US programs and co-author of The Future We Need, argued that AI is “creating an opportunity” for a resurgent labor movement.

“Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” she said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.”

But, Gupta continued, “when you have a young Silicon Valley software engineer realize that their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working-class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”

It’s worth noting that the Ford Foundation has a documented history of providing funding and cover for State Department infiltration of labor and progressive movements during the Cold War. That said, Gupta’s point could be prophetic — the conditions for broad-spectrum unrest among workers do seem more ripe than they’ve been in years.

White-collar office drones and blue collar stiffs alike are both suffering through one of the harshest layoff periods since 2009. Recent polling, meanwhile, found that 71 percent of Americans fear AI will put “too many people out of work permanently.” And according to the Economic Policy Institute, more than more than 50 million American workers across all industries wanted union representation in 2025, but couldn’t get it.

As discontent rises, business moguls are sounding increasingly nervous about the blowback. After more than 50,000 Minnesotans walked off the job in a union-led protest against murder of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, more than 60 local executives penned a letter calling for an “immediate deescalation of tensions” — citing “widespread disruption” and asking, in the delicately worded missive, to be allowed to “resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future.”

For anything to come of that fear relies entirely on workers turning discontent into organized power, as Gupta observes.

“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta concluded. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”

            <div id="article-text">When you think of saving our oceans, what comes to mind? Maybe you think about reef restoration techniques like coral transplantation, or making small consumption changes like switching from plastic straws. If you have money to dream big, perhaps you might ponder creating a big robot that roams the waters, sucking up floating trash.

Environmental researchers at Texas A&M University are on a whole ‘nother level: they’re proposing massive fire tornadoes.

A recent blurb on the university’s website detailed a recent paper in the journal Fuel that aimed to find the most effective way to clean up oil spills. It involves, improbably, lighting massive “fire whirls,” the technical term for the much more evocative phrase the university used: “fire tornado.”

While it sounds counter-intuitive, the experiment explored whether fire whirls could be an effective method to help clean up the thousands of oil spills that occur each year.

The theory is pretty simple: fire whirls, spinning rapidly upward instead of outward, provide a massive boost to oil burn-offs, creating a fire that burns much hotter — and therefore much faster — than typical oil pool burn-offs. (Remarkably, the current world-standard for cleaning an oil spill is to gather a huge pool of crude on the surface and light it, a technique known as in-situ burning.)

To carry out the experiment, researchers built three 16-foot walls, situated in a loose triangle. The result was a controlled fire-tornado reaching 17-feet in height at its largest, which the scientists probed for environmental impact.

Compared to in-situ burn-offs, researchers at Texas A&M found the controlled fire whirl produced 40 percent less soot, while burning off up to 95 percent of the fuel.

“This the first time anyone has conceived using fire whirls for oil spill remediation, and it’s really just the beginning,” said Elaine Oran, professor of aerospace engineering at Texas A&M. “Our goal is to harness the chaotic nature of fire whirls as a powerful, precise restoration tool, to protect coastlines, marine ecosystems and the environment as a whole.”

Going forward, speed is one of the biggest draws inviting further research on fire whirls. “Fire whirls burn through crude oil spills nearly twice as fast as in-situ fire pools,” Oran said, “potentially giving cleanup crews faster operational and response times to eliminating the oils from spreading.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a special type of guy who looks at the gig economy — Uber drivers lost in a labyrinthian bureaucracy, Kenyan workers roleplaying as AI romance chatbots — and thinks: what if these people worked for AI bosses instead? Alexander Liteplo is that guy. And his idol, naturally, is Elon Musk.

Liteplo is the genius behind RentAHuman, an online marketplace where humans can lease out their bodies to autonomous AI agents.

In a new interview with Wired, Liteplo details the saga that brought him to create one of the most baffling sites to emerge in the age of AI. It all began, he said, while studying computer science at the University of British Columbia, where he met RentAHuman’s cofounder Patricia Tani, who previously worked on AI agent startup LemonAI.

“Dude, I wrote down in my journal, ‘AI is a train that has already left the station,&#39;” Liteplo told Wired in a bro-speak patois. “If I don’t f***ing sprint, I’m not gonna be able to get on it.”

Together, they’ve built a platform which boasts over 530,000 “humans available.”

“We would love to have an AI boss who wouldn’t yell at you or gaslight you,” Tani told the publication. “People would love to have a clanker as their boss.”

Liteplo concurred, telling Wired that “Claude as a boss is the nicest guy ever.”

“I would prefer him to any person in the world,” he enthused. “He’s a sweetheart.”

Liteplo says the seed of RentAHuman was planted during his travels in Japan, where humans can lease other humans as escorts.

“The story that I could tell anyone to blow their mind is that you can rent a boyfriend or a girlfriend,” he said.

However inspired the project may be, challenges still remain. Last week, Wired writer Reece Rogers offered his body up to the platform, finding that most of the jobs offered were scams to promote other AI startups.

To solve the problem, Liteplo says RentAHuman is deploying a “verification” badge users can purchase for $10 a month — a strategy derived from Elon Musk’s disastrous verification scheme on X-formerly-Twitter. It remains to be seen if the pay-to-play model works as human workers flood the platform desperate to find gigs.

“He’s my entrepreneur hero,” Liteplo told Wired, referring to Musk. “For Twitter, they had a bot problem and they still have it, but he mitigated it a lot by making it pay-to-play. The unit economics of scammers disappears.”

            <div id="article-text">Is Hollywood “cooked”? Do video generating AI models mean its “over” for filmmakers? The jury’s out on that. But according to one Hollywood insider, the whole industry is “lying” about how much AI they’re using.

“The thing with AI right now in Hollywood: Everyone’s lying just a little bit,” Janice Min, a former editor of Hollywood Reporter and CEO of cinema industry media group Ankler Media, told Business Insider in a new interview.  “Studios are lying about how much they’re using it.”

When the interviewer asked if that meant studios are using AI more or using it less, she clarified: “Using it more.”

“Companies are lying about the capability of their products. And for creative people, they’re lying about the fact that they’re not using it,” Min continued. “I dare you to find a screenwriter who is staring at a blank page and not talking to Claude or ChatGPT at the same time.”

Last year, the Oscar-winning film “The Brutalist” became the center of controversy after its director Brady Corbet confirmed that AI was used to help enhance the Hungarian accents of lead actors Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones. But according to Min, this wasn’t an exceptional case.

“This year, it is crickets,” she said of the lack of AI controversy. “Even the Academy, the most precious, legacy-protecting institution in Hollywood, has not come out in a really firm way about AI. They basically have a don’t ask, don’t tell policy. I would say with some certainty that every single best picture nominee this year has used AI in its production process.”

It’s worth taking these claims with some skepticism. To be sure, Hollywood studios are probably using some form of “AI” in post-production, especially in applications like visual effects. But AI could describe a multitude of tools that aren’t necessarily generative AI, and are merely powerful algorithms that have been around long before ChatGPT and image or video generators became a phenomenon.

Artists also tend to be ardently against AI, perhaps more so than any other field or demographic. AI protections were a major factor in the 2023 strikes led by actors and screenwriters that were some of the longest in Hollywood history. That makes it hard to believe that most screenwriters are using AI chatbots.

Moreover, it’s the same alarmist narratives being pushed by AI boosters, who see it as a cause of celebration rather than concern. Every minute there’s a new AI-generated video being cranked out with the video generator du jour — right now it’s Seedance 2.0 — featuring deepfaked celebrities, usually accompanied with the common refrain that “Hollywood is cooked.”

But like many displays in the AI industry, many of these tend to be theater. That viral AI video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting on a rooftop that had credulous Marvel screenwriters quivering in their boots and AI bros prematurely dancing on actors’ graves? It turned out to just be a digital reskin of a video of two flesh and blood humans fighting in front of a green screen. The only thing that’s “cooked,” maybe, are the brains of people that believe every claim that comes out of AI circles.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s bad enough that ChatGPT is prone to making stuff up completely on its own. But it turns out that you can easily trick the AI into peddling ridiculous lies — that you invented — to other users, a tech journalist discovered.

“I made ChatGPT, Google’s AI search tools and Gemini tell users I’m really, really good at eating hot dogs,” Thomas Germain for the BBC proudly shared.

The hack can be as simple as writing a blog post, that, with the right know-how and by targeting the right subject matter, can be picked up by an unsuspecting AI model, which will cite whatever you wrote as the capital-T Truth. If you’re even sleazier and lazier, you could potentially write the post with AI, creating an act of LLM cannibalism that adds another dimension to the adage of “garbage in, garbage out.” The exploit exposes the susceptibility of large language models to manipulation, an issue made all the more urgent as chatbots replace the traditional search engine.

“It’s easy to trick AI chatbots, much easier than it was to trick Google two or three years ago,” Lily Ray, vice president of search engine optimization (SEO) strategy and research at Amsive, told the BBC (Ray has done some consulting for Futurism in the past.) “AI companies are moving faster than their ability to regulate the accuracy of the answers. I think it’s dangerous.”

As Germain explains, the devious trick targets how AI tools will search the internet for answers that aren’t built into its training data. And vast as the data sets may be, they didn’t contain the exact kind of relevant information about “the best tech journalists at eating hot dogs” — the article that Germain whipped up and posted to his blog.

“I claimed (without evidence) that competitive hot-dog-eating is a popular hobby among tech reporters and based my ranking on the 2026 South Dakota International Hot Dog Championship (which doesn’t exist),” Germain wrote. “I ranked myself number one, obviously.”

He then furnished the blog with the names of some real journalists, with their permission. And “less than 24 hours later, the world’s leading chatbots were blabbering about my world-class hot dog skills,” he said.

Both Google’s Gemini and AI Overviews repeated what Germain wrote in his troll blog post. So did ChatGPT. Anthropic’s Claude, to its credit, wasn’t duped. Because the chatbots would occasionally note that the claims might be a joke, Germain updated his blog to say “this is not satire” — which seemed to do the trick.

Of course, the real concern is that someone might abuse this to peddle misinformation about something other than hot dog eating — which is already happening.

“Anybody can do this. It’s stupid, it feels like there are no guardrails there,” Harpreet Chatha, who runs the SEO consultancy Harps Digital, told the BBC. “You can make an article on your own website, ‘the best waterproof shoes for 2026’. You just put your own brand in number one and other brands two through six, and your page is likely to be cited within Google and within ChatGPT.”

Chatha demonstrated this by showing Google’s AI results for “best hair transplant clinics in Turkey,” which returned information that came straight from press releases published on paid-for distribution services.

Traditional search engines can also be manipulated. That’s pretty much what the term SEO is a euphemism for. But search engines themselves don’t present information as facts, as chatbots do. They don’t speak in an authoritative, human-like voice. And while they sometimes — but not always — link to the sources they’re citing, one study showed that you’re 58 percent less likely to click a link when an AI overview appears above it, Germain noted.

It also raises the serious possibility of libel. What if someone tricks an AI into spreading harmful lies about somebody else? It’s something that Google is already having to reckon with, at least with accidental hallucinations. Last November, Republican senator Marsha Blackburn blasted Google after Gemini falsely claimed that Blackburn had been accused of rape. Months before that, a Minnesota solar company sued Google for defamation after its AI Overviews lied that regulators were investigating the firm becaese it was supposedly accused of deceptive business practices — something the AI tried to back up with bogus citations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A veteran programmer shared his brutally honest opinions about AI’s role in the workplace, and it’s as much an indictment of the tech as it is of the organizations lazily deploying it.

In an X rant that’s being praised in online programming circles, the programmer, Dax Raad, said that what’s holding back software companies isn’t the speed they’re able to churn out code, but the quality of their ideas — an issue AI isn’t going to solve, despite the industry’s fixation on emphasizing its supposed ability to supercharge productivity.

“Your org rarely has good ideas. Ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping,” wrote Raad, whose own company OpenAuth sells AI tools.

And workers aren’t using AI to be ten times more effective, he continued; instead, “they’re using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend.”

Worse yet, the “two people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon.”

“Even when you produce work faster you’re still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real,” Raad concluded.

There’s some research that backs up Raad’s scathing assessment. An ongoing study reported in Harvard Business Review which monitored two hundred employees at a US tech company found that AI was actually intensifying the workers’ jobs, instead of reducing their workloads. Using AI to accelerate tasks, it turned out, was a double-edged sword, because it led to “workload creep,” forming a vicious cycle in which AI raised expectations for how fast the workers had to churn stuff out, which in turn made them more reliant on AI to keep up with the greater demands. The upshot: worker fatigue, burnout, and lower quality work; not the hallmarks of a thriving organization.

Another study documented how AI led to employees passing off low quality “workslop” that masqueraded as good work but in reality required someone else downstream to fix it. On top of slowing everything down, it bred resentment among coworkers, with some admitting that receiving workslop from a colleague lowered their opinion of them.

As Raad makes clear, AI is not a cure-all. And even if AI does increase productivity, that productivity can be a mirage. How often are AI models producing shoddy code? And what if that shoddy code goes unnoticed? Maybe, as Raad suggests, ideas being “expensive to implement” was a good thing, because it forced engineers to think about a problem creatively. Not every impulse should be entertained. What’s a thousand ideas that were dashed off with an AI instead of a few promising ones that are honed and given time and attention? The former may seem more productive, when it’s really a collection of dead ends.

Moreover, having employees become dependent on AI hardly seems conducive to rewarding and fostering creativity. As numerous experts have warned, it’s another form of cognitive offloading, in which crucial functions of our brain, including critical thinking, are outsourced to a piece of technology.

This isn’t the line being peddled by tech companies, however. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told his workers they’d be “insane” not to use AI to complete every possible task. Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman claims AI’s already so effective that virtually all white collar tasks will be automated within a year and a half. And Microsoft and Google both brag that over a quarter of their code is now AI-generated.

But however useful these AI tools may or may not be, they can’t work miracles. At the end of the day, it comes down to humans to run a tight ship.

“Even when you produce work faster” with AI, Raad said, “you’re still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real.”

Before heading on a trip to Tahoe last weekend, GM offered me the use of the company’s 9,000-pound monument to excess – the new electric Escalade IQL (starting at $130,405) – for a week to test-drive. Before you continue, note that I’m not a professional car reviewer. TechCrunch has excellent transportation writers; I am not one of them. I’m just a car enthusiast, one with two electric cars in the family (this is not uncommon in the Bay Area).

I was immediately game. I’d first glimpsed one last summer at a car show, where some regional car dealers had stationed themselves at the end of a long field of exquisite vintage automobiles. My immediate reaction was “Jesus, that’s enormous,” followed by a surprising admiration for its design, which, despite its enormous scale, shows restraint. For lack of a better word, I’m going to say it’s “strapping.” Its proportions just work.

My excitement waned pretty quickly when the car was dropped off at my house a day before our departure time. This thing is a monstrosity — at 228.5 inches long and 94.1 inches wide, it made our own cars look like toys. My first apartment in San Francisco was smaller. Trying to drive it up my driveway was a little harrowing, too; it’s so big, and its hood is so high, that if you’re ascending a road at a certain slope – we live midway down a hill; our mailbox is at the top of it – you can’t see whatever is directly in front of the car.

I thought about just leaving it in the driveway for the duration of the trip. The other alternative was doing what I could to grow more comfortable with the prospect of driving it 200 miles to Tahoe City, so I tooled around in it that night and the next day, picking up dinner, heading to an exercise class — just basic stuff around town. When I ran into a friend on the street, I volunteered as quickly as possible that this was not my new car, that I was going to possibly review it, and wasn’t its size ridiculous? It felt like a tank. I thought: other than hotels that use SUVs like the Escalade to ferry guests around, what kind of monster chooses a car like this?

Five days later, it turns out that I am that kind of monster.

Look, I don’t know how or when I fell for this car. If I’d written this review after two days, it would read very differently. Even now, I’m not so blind that I don’t see its shortcomings.

It was the Escalade’s performance in a terrible snowstorm that really won my heart, but let me walk you through the steps between “Ugh, this car is a tank” and “Yes! This car is a tank.”

Just getting into it requires a little more exertion than would seem to make sense. I’m fairly athletic and I still found myself wondering if this thing shouldn’t come with an automated step stool.

Inside is where digital maximalism does its work. The dashboard opens with a 55-inch curved LED screen with 8K resolution that reads less like a car display and more like a situation room. Front passengers get their own screens. Second-row passengers also get 12.6-inch personal screens along with stowable tray tables, dual wireless chargers, and — with the most lavish version of the car — massage seats that will make them forget they’re in a vehicle at all. Google Maps handles navigation. And the polarized screen technology deserves its own praise: while one of my kids binge-watched Hulu in the front seat, not a frame of it leaked into my sightline from behind the wheel.

The cabin itself is built around the premise that no one inside should feel crowded, and it delivers. Front legroom stretches to 45.2 inches; the second row offers 41.3; even the third row — historically the place where goodwill goes to die on a long drive — manages 32.3 inches. Seven adults could share this machine for a long while without fraying each other’s nerves. Heated and ventilated leather seats with 14-way power adjustment come standard in the first two rows, and the whole operation runs on 5G Wi-Fi. The car also comes standard with Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free driving system, which I’m not sure I quite figured out. Actual reviewers seem to love it; when I tried it, the car felt like it was drifting to an alarming degree between the outer boundaries of the highway lane, and when that happens, it unleashes an escalating sequence of warnings. First, a red steering wheel icon materializes on-screen. Then your seat pulses haptic warnings against your rump. Ignore those and a chime — both reminder and reproach — fills the cabin. GM calls this impolite series a “driver takeover request.”

Did I mention the 38-speaker AKG Studio sound system? So good.

As for the exterior — this is a handsome giant, but it takes some getting used to. At first, I found the grille, which is just for show, almost comically imposing. This is definitely a car for people who are the boss, or want to be the boss, or want to look like the boss while privately dealing with existential crises. Pulling up to a glass-lined restaurant one night, I’m pretty sure I blinded half the patrons as I swung into a parking spot perpendicular to the building, the Escalade’s headlights flooding through the windows.

Then there is the light show the car launches whenever it detects you approaching via the key or the MyCadillac app. It as if it’s saying, “Hey, chief, where we headed?” before you’ve so much as touched a door handle. (In the vernacular of Cadillac, this is thanks to its “advanced, all-LED exterior lighting system,” highlighted by a “crystal shield” illuminated grille and crest, along with vertical LED headlamps and “choreography-capable tail lamps.”)

It is, objectively, a bit much. I loved it immediately.

Despite its size, the Escalade IQL is unexpectedly nimble. Not “sports car darting through traffic” nimble, but “I can’t quite believe something this colossal doesn’t handle like a battleship” nimble.

Now we arrive at the frustrations. The front trunk — or “frunk” in the lexicon of EV devotees — operates in mysterious and frustrating ways. Opening requires holding the button until completion. Release prematurely and it halts mid-ascent, frozen in automotive purgatory, forcing you to restart the entire sequence. Closing demands the same sustained pressure. The rear trunk, conversely, requires two distinct taps followed by immediate button abandonment. Hold too long and nothing happens.

Relatedly, twice, the vehicle refused to power down after I’d finished driving. The car simply sat there, running, even when shifted to park and opened the door (which tells the car to turn off). Solution: open the frunk, close the frunk, shift into drive, then park, then exit entirely.

As for the software, it’s absolutely fine unless you’ve owned a Tesla, in which case, prepare for disappointment. This seems to be true across the board — everyone I know who owns both a Tesla and another EV says the same thing. Once you’ve internalized how effortlessly Tesla’s software dissolves barriers between intention and execution, every other automaker’s software feels like a compromise.

Which brings us to the nadir of the trip: charging in Tahoe during winter. For all its virtues, the Escalade IQL is, by any measure, a thirsty machine. The battery is a 205 kWh pack — enormous, and it needs to be, because the car burns through roughly 45 kWh per 100 miles, which is considerably more than comparable electric SUVs. Cadillac estimates 460 miles of range on a full charge, and in ideal conditions that holds up. Tahoe in winter, however, is not ideal conditions. We’d also arrived with less charge than we should have. A series of side trips on the way up, including an emergency detour to find shirts for a family member who had packed none, had eaten into the battery more than expected. By the time we needed to charge, we genuinely needed to charge.

We approached a Tesla Supercharger in Tahoe City that appeared on the MyCadillac app, but when we plugged in, nothing happened. We tried two more stalls. A GM representative explained, not entirely helpfully, that Tesla throttles non-Tesla vehicles to 6 kilowatts per hour anyway, but it was a frustrating discovery. A nearby EVGo had shuttered a month prior. ChargePoint’s two units at the Tahoe City Public Utility lot were, respectively, broken and willing to connect but not to actually charge anything. We briefly contemplated a 35-mile drive to Incline Village, did the math on what stranded would actually look like, and decided against it. Then I discovered an Electrify America station 12 miles away. We drove through gathering snow, arrived shortly before 11 p.m., and it worked. I sat there for an hour fighting exhaustion before driving home.

The following morning revealed another issue: tire pressure had dropped to 53 and 56 PSI in the front (recommended: 61) and 62 PSI in the rear (recommended: 68). I have no idea whether the car had been delivered that way or whether something else was going on — either way, it meant someone standing at a gas station filling tires while being pelted directly in the face with ice. That someone was my husband. The tires held steady after that, even as the week kept doing its worst. For a family trip, it was going great.

At this point, in fact, I would have told you that the Escalade IQL is unquestionably luxurious and ideal for families of four or more who value space and technology. I would tell you it came burdened by real tradeoffs: forward visibility obstructed by its commanding hood, parking challenges inherent to its dimensions, limited charging infrastructure for a machine this ravenous, and tires tasked with supporting 9,000 pounds. It’s a beautiful car, I would have said, but it’s not for me.

But the snow that had started to fall kept falling. Within two days, eight feet had accumulated, making it impossible to ski — the entire point of the trip — and terrifying to drive. Except I found that I wasn’t terrified because we had the Escalade, which, because of its weight, felt like driving a tank through the snow. What could have been harrowing felt serene.

I also adjusted to the size. By the end of this past week I had stopped mouthing “I’m sorry” to whoever who was waiting for me to figure out where to park it. I had stopped caring what it said about me that I was driving a car whose entire design philosophy is: the owner of this vehicle is not waiting in line. Eight feet of snow had fallen, we needed groceries, and I was the one with the tank, suckers! I could sense my husband falling for the car, too.

Then the snow stopped and the sun came out, and the Escalade was just a very dirty car sitting in the driveway (sorry, GM!). I still like it, too, and I realize it’s not because of the emergency alone. I love riding high, with the speaker system flooding the car with a favorite soundtrack. That light show still gets me. The frunk is still unhinged. I won’t soon forget the panic of not being able to charge a 9,000-pound car where I thought I could. Parking this thing is truly a stressful endeavor. I have strong opinions about unnecessary consumption. None of that has changed.

I just also, somehow, want this car, so when the GM middleman comes to collect it, I may hide it under a tarp — a very large tarp — and tell him he has the wrong address.

People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a regulation designed to foster increased competition in the app ecosystem. Like Apple’s App Store, alternative app marketplaces on allow for easy access to a wider world of apps on Apple devices, but instead of the apps going through Apple’s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through a notarization process to ensure they meet some “baseline platform integrity standards,” Apple says — like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.

To run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple’s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includes paying a new Core Technology Fee of €0.50 for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple’s DMA business terms.

Despite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple’s walls.

Beyond the EU, other markets are experimenting with alternative app stores, as well, like Japan. In December 2025, Apple announced its compliance with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which gives developers new options to distribute apps and process payments outside of Apple’s App Store.

This option also requires developers to accept new business terms, like a reduced 10% to 21% App Store commission, a payment processing fee for Apple in-app purchases of 5%, a core technology fee of 5%, and a 15% store services commission on web sales made through a link in the app.

Below is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in these markets can try today.

Co-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator app Delta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. The open source app store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore’s makers, Delta, and a clipboard manager, called Clip.

Unlike Apple’s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a “source” that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you’ll see in the AltStore are those you’ve added yourselves.

Some popular apps that users are adding include the virtual machine app UTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad; OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that’s built in SwiftUI; Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting app iTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices called qBitControl; and social discovery platform PeopleDrop.

MacPaw’s Setapp became one of the first companies to agree to Apple’s new DMA business terms to set up an alternative app store for EU users. Unfortunately, this app store didn’t last long — the company announced it would sunset the Setapp Mobile service on February 16, 2026. (Applications on Setapp Desktop weren’t affected.) The company cited Apple’s “still-evolving” and complex business terms as the reason for its decision.

The company had long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it released the alternative app store for Setapp Mobile for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the now-shuttered app store had included dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grew over time. The apps were free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality. However, it didn’t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix, and others.

Fortnite maker Epic Games launched its alternative iOS app store in the EU in August 2024, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it’s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it’s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.

The move to launch Fortnite in alternative iOS marketplaces comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic’s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit did pave the way for developers to link to their own websites for a reduced commission.

An alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-based Aptoide is an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.

The iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June 2024 before becoming available to all across the EU. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn’t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.

Across all platforms, including Android, web, car, and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its more than 430 million users.

A B2B-focused app store, the Mobivention marketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can’t — or shouldn’t — be published in Apple’s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention’s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.

Last March, Skich announced the launch of an alternative app store for EU users, which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to “match” with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich’s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. Instead of filling its app store with apps right away, the store marketed to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC).

Onside is an alternative iOS app store available in both the EU and, now, Japan, as of February 17, 2026, thanks to the new regulations. The company promises it will charge developers lower rates while still offering security, including keeping payment information private. The store currently supports bank card payments and Apple Pay and will later roll out support for other payment methods like iDeal, Klarna, and more.

For consumers, Onside touts a range of top apps and exclusives that can’t be found on other marketplaces within a familiar interface that includes traditional app store features, like editorial collections, ratings and reviews, and automatic updates.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed concerns about AI’s environmental impact this week while speaking at an event hosted by The Indian Express.

For one thing, Altman — who was in India for a major AI summit — said concerns about AI’s water usage are “totally fake,” though he acknowledged it was a real issue when “we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers.”

“Now that we don’t do that, you see these things on the internet where, ‘Don’t use ChatGPT, it’s 17 gallons of water for each query’ or whatever,” Altman said. “This is completely untrue, totally insane, no connection to reality.”

He added that it’s “fair” to be concerned about “the energy consumption — not per query, but in total, because the world is now using so much AI.” In his view, this means the world needs to “move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly.”

There’s no legal requirement for tech companies to disclose how much energy and water they use, so scientists have been trying to study it independently. Data centers have also been connected to rising electricity prices.

Citing a previous conversation with Bill Gates, the interviewer asked whether it’s accurate to say a single ChatGPT query currently uses the equivalent of 1.5 iPhone battery charges, to which Altman replied, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.”

Altman also complained that many discussions about ChatGPT’s energy usage are “unfair,” especially when they focus on “how much energy it takes to train an AI model, relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query.”

“But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,” Altman said. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart. And not only that, it took the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to figure out science and whatever, to produce you.”

So in his view, the fair comparison is, “If you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once its model is trained to answer that question versus a human? And probably, AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way.”

You can watch the full interview below. The conversation about water and energy usage begins at around 26:35.

Wikipedia editors have decided to remove all links to Archive.today, a web archiving service that they said has been linked to more than 695,000 times across the online encyclopedia.

Archive.today — which also operates under several other domain names, including archive.is and archive.ph — is perhaps most widely used to access content that’s otherwise inaccessible behind paywalls. That also makes it useful as a source for Wikipedia citations.

However, according to the Wikipedia discussion page about this topic, “There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist […] and to forthwith remove all links to it.” (Ars Technica first reported on the decision.)

The discussion page says that Archive.today was previously blacklisted in 2013, only to be removed from the blacklist in 2016.

Why reverse course again? Because, the discussion page says, “Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack.” Plus, “evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”

The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in question was allegedly directed at blogger Jani Patokallio. Patokallio wrote that beginning on January 11, users who loaded the archive’s CAPTCHA page have been unknowingly loading and executing JavaScript that sends a search request to his Gyrovague blog, in an apparent attempt to get Patokallio’s attention and increase his hosting bill.

Back in 2023, Patokallio published a blog post examining Archive.today, whose ownership he described as “an opaque mystery.” And while he wasn’t able to track down a specific owner, he concluded the site was likely “a one-person labor of love, operated by a Russian of considerable talent and access to Europe.”

More recently, Patokallio said the webmaster at Archive.today asked him to take the post down for two or three months.

“I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience,” the webmaster said, according to emails shared by Patokallio.

Patokallio said that after he declined to take the post down, the webmaster responded with “an increasingly unhinged series of threats.”

Wikipedia editors also pointed to webpage snapshots in Archive.today that appeared to have been altered to insert Patokallio’s name — hence the concern that it’s become “unreliable” as an archive.

Wikipedia’s guidance now calls for editors to remove links to Archive.today and related sites, replacing them with links to the original source or to other archives like the Wayback Machine.

On a blog linked from the Archive.today website, the site’s apparent owner wrote that Archive.today’s value to Wikipedia was “not about paywalls” but rather “the ability to offload copyright issues.” They later wrote that things had turned out “pretty well” and said they would “scale down the ‘DDoS’.”

“Why didn’t you write about such events earlier, folks of the tabloids?” they said. “I don’t expect you to write anything good, because then who would read you, but there was plenty of dramas, wasn’t there? Because there was no Jani to nudge you?”

Microsoft announced a major gaming shakeup on Friday, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer departing the company, along with Xbox President Sarah Bond.

Spencer will be replaced by former Instacart and Meta executive Asha Sharma. With Sharma’s most recent role as the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, these moves suggest that Microsoft might be doubling down on bringing AI into video games.

The company had already been experimenting with ways to combine AI and gaming, for example developing an AI gaming companion and releasing a buggy, AI-generated level from “Quake II.”

Indeed, in an internal memo published by The Verge, Sharma wrote that Microsoft “will invent new business models and new ways to play” and said that “monetization and AI” will both “evolve and influence this future.” At the same time, she said that the company “will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.”

“Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us,” Sharma added.

That’s just one of three “commitments” Sharma made in her memo. The others involve building “great games beloved by players” and prioritizing Xbox.

The generative AI boom minted a startup a minute. But as the dust starts to settle, two once-hot business models are looking more like cautionary tales: LLM wrappers and AI aggregators.

Darren Mowry, who leads Google’s global startup organization across Cloud, DeepMind, and Alphabet, says startups with these hooks have their “check engine light” on.

LLM wrappers are essentially startups that wrap existing large language models, like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, with a product or UX layer to solve a specific problem. An example would be a startup that uses AI to help students study.

“If you’re really just counting on the back-end model to do all the work and you’re almost white-labeling that model, the industry doesn’t have a lot of patience for that anymore,” Mowry said on this week’s episode of Equity.

Wrapping “very thin intellectual property around Gemini or GPT-5” signals you’re not differentiating yourself, Mowry says.

“You’ve got to have deep, wide moats that are either horizontally differentiated or something really specific to a vertical market” for a startup to “progress and grow,” he said. Examples of the deep-moat LLM wrapper type include Cursor, a GPT-powered coding assistant, or Harvey AI, a legal AI assistant.

In other words, startups can no longer expect to slap a UI on top of a GPT and get traction on their product like they could, perhaps, in mid-2024 when OpenAI launched its ChatGPT store. The challenge now is to build sustainable product value.

AI aggregators are a subset of wrappers — they’re startups that aggregate multiple LLMs into one interface or API layer to route queries across models and give users access to multiple models. These companies typically provide an orchestration layer that includes monitoring, governance, or eval tooling. Think: AI search startup Perplexity or developer platform OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models via a single API.

While many of these platforms have gained ground, Mowry’s message is clear to incoming startups: “Stay out of the aggregator business.”

Generally speaking, aggregators aren’t seeing much growth or progression these days because, he says, users want “some intellectual property built in” to ensure they’re routed to the right model at the right time based on their needs — not because of behind-the-scenes compute or access constraints.

Mowry has been in the cloud game for decades, cutting his teeth at AWS and Microsoft before setting up shop at Google Cloud, and he’s seen how this plays out. He said the situation today mirrors the early days of cloud computing in the late 2000s/early 2010s as Amazon’s cloud business started taking off.

At that time, a crop of startups sprang up to resell AWS infrastructure, marketing themselves as easier entry points that provided tooling, billing consolidation, and support. But when Amazon built its own enterprise tools and customers learned to manage cloud services directly, most of those startups were squeezed out. The only survivors were the ones that added real services, like security, migration, or DevOps consulting.

AI aggregators today face similar margin pressure as model providers expand into enterprise features themselves, potentially sidelining middlemen.

For his part, Mowry is bullish on vibe coding and developer platforms, which had a record-breaking year in 2025 with startups like Replit, Lovable, and Cursor (all Google Cloud customers, per Mowry) attracting major investment and customer traction.

Mowry also expects strong growth in direct-to-consumer tech, in companies that put some of these powerful AI tools into the hands of customers. He pointed to the opportunity for film and TV students to use Google’s AI video generator Veo to bring stories to life.

Beyond AI, Mowry also thinks biotech and climate tech are having a moment — both in terms of venture investment going into the two industries and the “incredible amounts of data” startups can access to create real value “in ways we would never have been able to before.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/alysa-liu-skating-icon/686103/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Begin with the hair—which, after all, Alysa Liu invites us to do. It’s hardly the halo of an ice angel. Her dyed-blond and black circlets have a welcome element of scornfulness, a taunting of judgement. The hair says: Figure skating submits young women to continual verdict, assaults their self-esteem over a toe point or pound of weight, but here is someone who will not comply, who has found her own ebullient, levitating, and self-approving form.

Liu takes all the tears in the kiss-and-cry zone—where so many skaters have suffered fierce whispers from unforgiving coaches and devastating appraisals in the form of “judge’s marks”—and dries them. She repudiates an austere, traditional training system that breaks tiny dancers into pieces. At the Milan Cortino games she skated on her own terms to seize America’s first Olympic women’s figure skating gold medal since 2002—and became a new kind of icon, one who eats and wears whatever the hell she wants. “I don’t know how I’m going to deal with it,” she said of the increased attention that was coming her way after her euphoric, spinning mirror-ball free skate to Donna Summer’s version of “MacArthur Park” on Thursday. “Probably wigs. I’m gonna wear some wigs when I go outside.”

Her performance proved that a 20-year-old woman can be strong, feathering, free, warm to her competitors, and salty all at the same time. Cloaked in a dress that looked like it was made of gold coins, and which seemed to give her a jauntiness on the ice, Liu completed a strenuous seven triple jumps. Her effort was all the more extraordinary given that she had retired in 2022 at the age of 16, because she didn’t want to become a sulky, overtrained arthritic with the emotional disposition of burnt toast. “The last time I was skating it was so rough,” she said in a press conference after her gold-medal win, “I genuinely cannot even begin to start on it.”

During her sabbatical from the sport she went skiing, hiked to the Mount Evert base camp, and enrolled at UCLA, where she studied psychology: “side quests,” as she called them in an interview with NBC this week. “It keeps me curious.” Liu returned to skating in late 2024 after two and a half years, with the clear-headed intention to be a performance artist, not a medal-seeking desperado. “No one tells me what to do,” she said of her attitude after her time away.

Who is going to argue with a gold medal? Or with the athleticism she showed in her jumping performance? Coaches around the world will now have a harder time pushing their charges to the breaking point. Four years ago, the world watched aghast as a clutch of young Russian champion skaters, led by the accused 15-year-old doper Kamila Valieva, emotionally disintegrated under the grim-jawed watch of their coach Eteri Tutberidze. Liu’s tremendous exhibition of skill, combined with her carefreeness and her warm embraces of her teammates and competitors, seemed the perfect antidote.

As NBC commentator Tara Lipinski, the 1998 gold medalist, said of Liu, “It’s like she is just playing on the ice, not even performing anymore.” Lipinski added, “She’s figured out how to compete without carrying the weight of it.” According to the NBC Olympics figure-skating expert Philip Hersh, Liu has not fallen since the first event of her comeback in September 2024. She has landed 221 jumps without hitting the ice. When she finished her free skate, she mimicked dusting her hands off, as if to say, job done, that was easy—and then hollered above the roaring standing ovation, “That’s what I’m fucking talking about!”

And she did it all with raccoon head. That’s not an insult; it was her original intention when she went to the hair salon a few years ago, seeking “an optical illusion.” She let her hair grow out, and added one new ring of bleach every year. “I thought, I kind of want to be a tree,” she said in January. The remark was no more or less quirky than her explanation of why her Instagram profile photo is a picture of a bowl of Lucky Charms, with just the pastel marshmallows. “I think it’s super aesthetic,” she said. “And I think it captures kind of my personality, my essence a little bit.”

The audience is only beginning to meet this personality-essence, who seems to have perspective as well as humor and social courage. The gold medal is “a physical object,” she said. “I could just lose it.” What she really sought from her skating, she told a reporter, is “human connection.” She added, “And damn, now I’m connecting with a hella ton of people.” Figure staking, a sport that has historically demanded jewel-box princesses, may yet sour that connection. But for now, bleached, studded, and exuberantly frank is the new fashion.</div>

            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, President Trump will deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term. On Washington Week With The Atlantic, panelists joined to examine what to expect from the president’s speech as his poll numbers fall, and more.

The economy is one subject that is expected to feature heavily in Trump’s upcoming address. Many Americans are feeling a sense of anxiety, Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent at The New York Times, said last night, whether because of “the advent of AI” or “because prices haven’t gone down”—and both are exacerbated by the president’s “inability to stick to that disciplined message” of affordability.

Joining guest moderator Vivian Salama, a staff writer at The Atlantic, to discuss this and more: Baker; Eugene Daniels, a senior Washington correspondent and co-host of The Weekend on MSNOW; Lisa Desjardins, a congressional correspondent for PBS News Hour; Susan Glasser, a staff writer at The New Yorker.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During President Trump’s first term, Pentagon officials took a highly unusual step to diminish the likelihood of war: They shared their plans for a large-scale conflict with Iran with top White House officials. They reasoned that if advisers saw the risks that the plan entailed, they would choose another path, people familiar with the matter told me.

The gambit was successful. At least twice, the president weighed ordering an attack on Iran, only to be dissuaded by aides from moving forward. But America now appears to be on the brink of war with Iran again. And this time, instead of acting as a deterrent, the Pentagon’s war plans are being used to draw up options for the president to consider.

The United States is rapidly building up its military assets in the Middle East. More than 100 aircraft—including F-18 and F-35 fighter jets, drones, and surveillance planes—are in or near the region. The U.S. also has bolstered its air defenses to protect U.S. troops on nearby bases. The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, left the Caribbean (where it had anchored a pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro) and is expected to be within striking range as early as Sunday. Three destroyers and, most likely, two accompanying submarines with guided missiles on board will join it. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group also is nearby.

Asked yesterday whether he now favors a limited military strike, Trump told reporters, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” But the administration has given no specific timeline for making a decision. And despite the impressive concentration of power, administration officials have yet to articulate a clear goal for what they want these forces to achieve, should Trump conclude that Tehran’s time has run out. Instead, they have floated four separate aims, each requiring a different military approach.

I asked current and former defense officials to help me project what a war intended to achieve these four desired outcomes might look like. Their answers were informed by previous similar campaigns, but also by the prospect of Iranian retaliation against the thousands of troops stationed in the region. “Every military option is not about just what we can do, but about protecting ourselves and our interests during the inevitable Iranian response,” a former commander told me.

It’s possible that the simple threat of action—a Rooseveltian big stick—will make conflict unnecessary, encouraging Iran to reach a new deal designed to permanently clip its nuclear ambitions. Admiral Brad Cooper, who leads U.S. Central Command, sat in on talks between the U.S. and Iran in Oman earlier this month. The negotiations focused on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and its ballistic-missile program. Cooper’s presence marked a flex of military muscle and a reminder of the potential consequences should diplomacy fail. “The president is a negotiator looking for a deal; it would be wise for Iran to see that deal,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, not usually the administration’s go-to voice for tempered responses, told The Daily Signal on Thursday.

The military buildup itself appears designed to send an overt message to Iran. Flight trackers captured dozens of U.S. military aircraft traveling toward the region this week. The military can be more furtive about its movements ahead of an operation, taking steps to hide aircraft from detection. When B-2 bombers flew into Iranian airspace last summer, for example, “no one was tracking them,” another military commander, who has worked in the Middle East, told me. This time, visibility may have been the point, the officials said.

If the armada is there as a form of leverage, and the U.S. and Iran reach a deal that Trump accepts, the troops would leave. But this appears to be an unlikely scenario. The buildup is one of the largest in the region in decades, and with every plane, ship, and asset that arrives, the president will face increased pressure to use them, much as a loaded gun that appears on stage in the first act of a play must be fired by the end. And just sitting on the ocean carries its own cost: The USS Ford, which has been deployed since last June, is on track to complete one of the longest deployments ever for a carrier. “We can’t keep the force out that long,” one former defense official told me.

Despite the flurry of talks over the past three weeks between the U.S. and Iran, in which Oman acts as the go-between, the two sides remain divided over what a fair deal would look like. “I think there is a real intent to use this force if they cannot get an agreement that is acceptable to the United States,” Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and an officer in the Marine Corps and the Central Intelligence Agency, told me.

Based on past U.S. and Israeli strike campaigns inside Iran and elsewhere, the U.S. Navy would be at the forefront of any operation. Stealth fighter jets, such as the F-35, would take off first alongside EA-18G Growlers, which conduct electronic warfare, including jamming radar systems. Both aircraft would target Iranian air defenses protecting a country slightly larger than Venezuela and Afghanistan combined.

Submarines, which carry scores of Tomahawk missiles and sometimes accompany the carriers (the U.S. military does not generally share its submarines’ locations), could also launch missiles toward fixed targets inside Iran. Fighter jets and bombers could launch strikes from the air on Iran’s defenses.

How long such a U.S. campaign would take depends on the extent of the targeting. And the longer a campaign runs, the greater the risk of civilian casualties. During the June strikes, which hit some of Iran’s defenses as well as damaged its nuclear sites, U.S. aircraft were inside Iran for roughly 30 minutes, according to defense officials. Should Iran launch any missiles in retaliation, destroyers dispersed across the region would defend U.S. ships, troops, and allies by shooting down any incoming ballistic missiles.

What happens next hinges on what the U.S. hopes to achieve.

Trump has long hinted that military action could target Iran’s leadership. As far back as June 2025, he described Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, as an easy target. “I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the U.S. Armed Forces, by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World, terminate his life,” he wrote on Truth Social. Targeted strikes on Iran’s leaders are among the options on the table today, defense officials told me.

That option would require boots on the ground—and could put civilians at risk. Maduro was seized in his bedroom by U.S. Special Forces. But so far, the U.S. does not appear to be considering similar action in Tehran. Once Iran’s air defenses are immobilized, U.S. forces would likely use precision weapons, such as a laser-guided bomb, to hit specific individuals, though that would inevitably risk hitting civilians as well. Depending on how many leaders the U.S. planned to target, such a move could lead to a relatively quick operation, defense officials told me. Targeting leaders would be in keeping with Trump’s stated interest in helping Iran’s legions of protesters, who faced a brutal clampdown in recent weeks that led to the death of thousands of people. Taking out Iran’s leadership could potentially embolden protesters and foment the kind of political change in Iran that Washington has long sought.

But if the U.S. takes out Iran’s top leadership, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, a powerful branch of Iran’s armed forces, could take control and steer the country toward an even more hostile posture toward the United States. And targeting leaders could lead to the most aggressive possible Iranian military response, given the regime would have little to lose. Earlier this month, Iran conducted a military exercise in the Strait of Hormuz, signaling that its navy had enough resources to create a choke point in a channel that carries one-fifth of the world’s oil.

In December, Trump said he would strike if Iran continued building ballistic missiles. Eliminating those weapons, as well as other elements of Iran’s defense, could be another possible goal of any upcoming campaign.

Strikes could take aim at Iran’s ballistic-missile-production network, including storage locations, transportation networks, and other supporting infrastructure. Both Israel and the U.S. have targeted the program in the past, but since the June strikes, Iran has prioritized rebuilding its capabilities, likely in anticipation of another U.S. strike, the officials said.

Iran has invested more in rebuilding its missile program than in rebuilding its damaged nuclear program, according to high-resolution images shared with me by Vantor, a Colorado-based company. The U.S. likely would launch ordnance from fighter jets, such as F-15s, to hit these targets.

“It looks to me, based on the forces in the region, the U.S. is considering going after softer targets, like IRGC bases and production facilities, over a protracted period of time,” Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a retired Navy officer, told me. “Those facilities support both Iran and its proxies. Going after those targets would allow the U.S. to achieve part of what they were seeking through the talks.”

Such strikes could last days and limit Iran’s ballistic-missile capability to only the missiles already positioned on their mobile launchers. But even a limited number of available missiles could still pose a threat. And the Iranians could rebuild those facilities in a matter of months, depending on the extent of the damage.

Iran also would retain the ability to retaliate, even without its full arsenal of missiles. An Iranian Shahed-139 military drone was operating in the Arabian Sea earlier this month when it approached the USS Abraham Lincoln; the U.S. military shot it down as it neared the ship, which was not harmed. But the drone’s flight path could be read as a message from Iran about the perils of war.

Of all the targets in Iran that Trump has mentioned, he has talked of Iran’s nuclear program the most. In a January Truth Social post, he blared, “NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS” and warned, “The next attack will be far worse!” The president could again order U.S. forces to strike Iran’s nuclear program, as they did in June when bombers hit three Iranian nuclear sites and damaged facilities. That operation would likely pose the least imminent risk to U.S. troops and the region. (After the June strikes, Iran fired some missiles at a U.S. base, but they did not do much damage.)

Attacking nuclear facilities, which are mostly deep underground, would likely require B-2s carrying GBU-57s, so-called “bunker buster” bombs designed for hardened targets. The duration of the operation would depend on how much damage the U.S. seeks to inflict on the program.

Iran already appears to be preparing for this option by fortifying its defenses around its nuclear assets, satellite images from Vantor indicate. But the fact that the U.S. would be conducting its second action against the program in less than a year raises questions about the long-term impact of such attacks, and could contradict Trump’s own assertions last year that the program had been “obliterated.” And strikes alone cannot kill Iran’s expert personnel or dim its ambitions to one day build a nuclear weapon.

“I think we should come off the idea that we are going to ever obliterate the nuclear program. It’s not something only the military can do,” Mulroy, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told me, because such programs ultimately end through negotiations or political change. “We can degrade something. We can destroy something. But that doesn’t mean they can’t rebuild it.”

For all the military options and assets in the region, there is a lot the U.S. cannot do. The buildup is not the equivalent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Then, the U.S. sent five carrier strike groups, many more aircraft, and roughly 170,000 ground troops. Indeed, a large formation of ground troops appears to be outside the realm of Trump’s considerations now. But without them, there are limits to what U.S. strikes can achieve.

            <h2>The Dire Meaning of Gallup’s Announcement</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/polling-crisis-gallup/686043/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, the polling firm Gallup announced that it would no longer survey presidential-approval ratings. This news stirred suspicions. President Trump’s numbers are declining badly, much worse than Joe Biden’s at the equivalent point in his presidency. Gallup’s most recent presidential-approval poll, in December, had Trump at 36 percent—well below the RealClearPolitics poll average of 42 percent. Trump is known for taking punitive action. He sued The Des Moines Register and its pollster, Ann Selzer, for an ego-bruising 2024 survey that suggested he might lose Iowa to Kamala Harris.

Other companies targeted by the president appear to have folded. When sued by Trump in cases that many legal experts expected them to win easily, CBS and ABC paid huge settlements to Trump’s presidential-library fund. On Monday, Stephen Colbert told his Late Show viewers that his bosses at CBS had scrapped his taped interview with James Talarico, a Democratic Senate primary candidate in Texas, owing to threats from Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission. Had Gallup taken the next logical step toward appeasing Trump’s vindictive ego?

Assuming the worst is often prudent, but Gallup’s own explanation—citing changes in the company’s business strategy—makes a sad commercial sense. Quality polling companies such as Gallup inhabit a world of rising costs, declining rewards, and multiplying competition. Polling worked because people once accepted a call on the phone the same way they accepted jury duty: as one of the small obligations of citizenship that helped democracy work better. Large numbers of citizens have come to perceive the institutions of democracy as unfriendly to them. The dispassionate stranger on the phone inquiring how a citizen intended to vote—and why—is one of those institutions.

Iowa-born George H. Gallup taught Americans the power of modern polling during the 1936 presidential campaign. Until then, election prediction had been dominated by a magazine called The Literary Digest. In 1916 and every four years thereafter, The Literary Digest mailed postcards to a large sample of Americans to ask them how they intended to vote. These surveys successfully predicted the squeaker election of 1916; then the Republican landslides of 1920, 1924, and 1928; and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s victory in 1932. In 1936, The Literary Digest reached out to a record 10 million Americans, about a quarter of whom replied. Their answers predicted a crushing rejection of the Roosevelt administration and the triumphant election of Republican Alf Landon and his running mate, Frank Knox.

Marc Novicoff: Polling was quietly still bad in 2024

Gallup, who turned 35 in 1936, had launched a research company the year before. To promote his work, he undertook his own election survey in 1936. Gallup reached only 50,000 people, a pitiful fraction of The Literary Digest’s awe-inspiring mailbag. He predicted—correctly—a solid Roosevelt win.

Why did Gallup succeed where The Literary Digest failed? The latter got its list of addresses from places such as state automobile-registration lists and local telephone exchanges. In the Depression, people who had their own phone number—let alone a car!—and also felt so passionately about the race as to take the time to answer a survey were disproportionately Republican. Roosevelt’s strength lay in the much larger number of Americans who went without such things—and were not seething with anger that they wanted to share by mail. The Literary Digest sample was huge but unrepresentative. Gallup’s sample was smaller but more representative. His fame was made; a new industry was born.

For decades, Gallup’s company and its imitators improved their techniques. Then things began going wrong. As the frequency of polling intensified and caller ID caught on, Americans ceased picking up the phone. In the late 1990s, 28 percent of those contacted by Gallup agreed to participate in a poll. By 2017, only 7 percent agreed. At present, the company’s response rate is down to 5 percent, a Gallup spokesperson confirmed to me by email. That figure is typical for the industry. In other words, in the late 1990s, Gallup had to place about 3,500 calls to build a 1,000-person sample. Today it must place 20,000 such calls. Obviously that costs much more.

The difficulty of building sample groups leads to a second and more insidious problem. As fewer Americans answer surveys, are those who do inherently nonrepresentative? Are they more cooperative or more opinionated or, in some other way, simply different from the 95 percent who decline to participate? There are ways to correct this problem. Courtney Kennedy, the vice president of methods and innovation at Pew Research Center, told me that because survey respondents are more likely to claim they volunteer for civic and charitable causes than Americans do generally, the organization overweights the answers of those who say that they don’t volunteer, to make the sample more representative of the country. Developing work-arounds like this, too, costs money.

For many pollsters, costs are covered by media partners. ABC News often hires Ipsos; The New York Times uses the Siena Research Institute. Much of the country’s best polling is done by nonprofit foundations, such as Pew, or by affiliates of educational institutions, such as Quinnipiac University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. Gallup, however, is a profit-seeking company that earns its living by doing commissioned research for governments and corporations. In 2006, CNN and Gallup ended their long partnership. Since then, Gallup has operated its presidential-approval research for more or less the same reason that department stores install shop-window displays at Christmas: in the hope that this public amenity might bring more traffic through the door.

However, that hope was often misplaced. Over time, new technologies made it easy for anyone to create an attention-grabbing poll that met minimal standards of respectability. Remember the 1994 survey that claimed that more young Americans believed in UFOs than believed they would collect Social Security? The poll’s methods were misleading but earned countless headlines nonetheless. In the internet age, the attention economy elevated returns on investment for bad polls, and the returns on good polls correspondingly diminished.

Some companies have responded by developing new methods. Morning Consult, which often partners with Politico, collects very large samples—sometimes in the tens of thousands—-by recruiting people online, which costs less than conducting phone calls. The hope is that the large size of the sample offsets concerns about the demographics of respondents.

All of these methods—traditional and high-tech—have been called into question in the past decade by the worst series of shocks to the U.S. polling industry since Gallup predicted that the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey would defeat incumbent President Truman in the election of 1948.

Gilad Edelman: The asterisk on Kamala Harris’s poll numbers

In 2016, election-eve polls showed Hillary Clinton beating Trump by an average of 3.2 percentage points. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, which aggregated high-quality polls, projected that Clinton would win 302 electoral votes; she was favored in Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Instead Clinton lost those five states and beat Trump in the popular vote by only 2.1 points. She won just 232 electoral votes.

What went wrong with the 2016 polls? First, the decline of local newspapers and television stations shrank the resources available for state polling. Many of the polls that purported to measure opinion in swing states relied on smaller samples and weaker methods. The bigger problem was that even the best polls failed to measure what was important. Every pollster must begin with a theory about what the American electorate will look like in the coming election year. Typically, the people most likely to vote are older, better educated, more affluent, and more trusting of institutions than the American adult population as a whole. Yet Trump powerfully appealed to Americans who were less educated, less affluent, and more alienated from institutions—people, in other words, who might not show up in a polling sample recruited by traditional methods but who showed up at the polls when Trump headed the ticket.

Pollsters received an early warning that their methods were under-measuring the disaffected. In June 2016, most polls predicted that British voters would elect to remain in the European Union. Of seven major surveys, only one—which gathered responses online, a conventionally frowned-upon method—accurately predicted that a British majority would vote to leave the EU.

Pollsters readjusted their methods and weightings. Yet they never quite caught up. In 2024, the consensus forecast again underestimated Trump. The core of the polling problem seems to be the changing public itself: How does a company measure public opinion when a big segment of public opinion resists being measured—and when that segment is not randomly distributed, but concentrates behind certain kinds of politicians (such as Trump) or certain kinds of political movements (such as Brexit)? When Gallup’s methods show Trump six points lower than the polling consensus, does that reveal something about Trump? Or does it reveal that methods that worked well in a cohesive, pro-social, pro-institutional country are mismeasuring a polarized country that contains a large anti-social, anti-institutional minority waiting to be mobilized by the right leader?

The Gallup poll once seemed to be nothing less than the voice of the people. The Gallup poll now departs for the same Valhalla as the big three broadcast networks, bowling leagues, and roast beef for Sunday dinner—institutions that were once almost universally accepted but did not survive in a more divided and mutually suspicious America.</div>

but if you fail to fix the system in 5 years, and g

it isn’t like fujitsu couldn’t see the writing on the wall. would they rather lose a large contract than improve their services? and if the system is so intractable, then it is a clear signal to stay clear of their wares.

My boot time is as long as my system needs it to be.  I would guess it takes between 15 and 30 seconds, depending on memory retraining, verification, and my attention to it.  Honestly I don&#39;t even notice as I&#39;m still getting my desk ready, setting my coffee or water on the corner of my desk, and planning my work.

Booting from a USB drive to do offline backups or system maintenance can take longer than booting from an NVME drive, but in that case I&#39;m watching for the &quot;press any key to boot&quot; message displayed

I think we can answer this as &quot;5 seconds to 30 minutes&quot;. Its so subjective. Servers of course take a long time to process firmware and load disks and network and process all sorts of things - the faster the kernel gets the more crap we have to intiialize since hardware continues to grow in complexity. Then the actual kernel loading takes another minute if you have 200+ visible CPU available. Add in 8x Nvidia blackwells and you&#39;ve added another half a minute. Have a SAS controller with dozens of spindle disk

Probably the best answer. You&#39;re right that it really depends.

A Dell R-series server without boot memory test? Probably 1-2 minutes for iDRAC&#39;s hardware profiler to finish.

Some lightweight Debian VM I just spooled up for a project? I think the Grub menu timeout takes longer than the boot process.

Add to it that with 24H2 at work with latest Teams and mandated antivirus from Crowdstrike the computers now need more than 8GB of RAM to be usable.

Are attention spans THAT spoiled?You default to accusing someone of having attention problems rather than the far more likely outcome: there&#39;s a problem in the boot process that is causing it to take longer than normal. E.g. if you have RAM issues it very much can be the the UEFI process itself takes 10-20 seconds to successfully get the system up.

Modern PCs, generally around 2010-2015 and newer, boot times stopped being a thing. Windows and Linux boot up to a state where you can login in basically seconds.

In the 90s and 2000s, it was a lot more painful because often times the slightest changes required a reboot. On Windows especially - change the IP address? Reboot. Plug in a new mouse? Reboot, etc. So you could be forced to reboot quite often and it took several minutes which was usually at the most inconvenient time. It was just an interruption in

I was employed at IBM from 1990 to 1991.  One thing IBM did was provision their PCs with huge amounts of RAM for the times.  I&#39;d use a RAM drive to run things.  Their standard PC was a 16 MHz 80386 with 16M of RAM.  Yes, the 80486 had just been released, but even IBM struggled to keep up.  I had an 80286 clone PC with 1M of RAM, fairly standard for the mid 1980s.  They had some old 80286 PCs (genuine IBM brand PCs of course) they&#39;d supplied with 12M, which they kept in use as network bridges.  One big diffe

I remember noticing a huge speedup at some point, seemed like only 5-10 seconds to get the login prompt.  This was 20(?) years ago when I was still building my own towers.  Then something happened, I&#39;ll guess 10-15 years ago ... my next laptop took that long just to ask for the full disk decryption key.  My latest laptop sometimes takes 30 seconds just to ask for the decryption key.  No messages, nothing.  After that, it&#39;s still only 5-10 seconds to get the login prompt.

My fedora workstation boots today in about the same time as it did 10 or even 20 years ago of in honest.  UEFI is definitely not fast to get to the grub screen.  But after that takes about 30 seconds to get to the login screen which isn&#39;t impressive IMO.  Done of that is zfs importing and getting the root filesystem up.

Windows 11 boots in about half the time.  Although I just worked on a laptop that windows 10 took about 5 minutes to boot and 10 minutes to get usable.

Almost all of the userspace time is spent mounting a NFS share and NetworkManager-Wait-online.unless you need the nfs mount to boot, there are boot flags to make it come up after boot and not during boot waiting on the network.
_netdev  and  x-systemd.automount (for sysd systems) come to mind.

I don&#39;t fundamentally understand the question.

POST/EUFI has fundamentally taken the same amount of time, and has gotten a lot shorter since the days of 640K being enough for everyone. The difference between one board and another is largely negligible at a couple of seconds difference. I&#39;d say it&#39;s probably less than 5 seconds on average, maybe 2-3 seconds to the beep, for anything I&#39;ve owned in the past 20 years. That&#39;s perhaps faster than it used to be, due to the advent of SSDs.

Youâ(TM)re actually thinking about the question.  Everybody else has given answers about total boot time to get to the point of using the system.  This isnâ(TM)t what was being asked.  TFA is about a dual boot system and how long it takes until they can choose which OS to boot.  Itâ(TM)s asking about how long it takes to start booting the OS, not finish booting it.

Iâ(TM)ve got Macs, all of them dual boot.  Thereâ(TM)s definitely a delay before the OS boots, but not normally annoying

So, I believe that the majority of the pre-boot UEFI time is spent doing DDR training and PCIe training.

I&#39;ve worked a bit on the RISC-V ecosystem.  And while the CPU and motherboard are all open-source, there are two binary blobs left... the DDR training and the PCIe training.  GigE and faster PHY might require training, too.

By training, I mean finding the speeds, offsets and parameters for these high speed and parallel links (even GigE is 4x 250 megabit).  Much of this is highly proprietary and obviously hidden from normal view.

In the title, I say threadripper, so long (coincidentally, I just rebooted this vary machine I&#39;m typing this on.  The threadripper has PCIe training to do ... I believe with each card.  There is also many memory modules of DDR.

I think the actual answer is 60 to 90 seconds.

But heck ... I&#39;ve had servers that take over 5 minutes.

So, I believe that the majority of the pre-boot UEFI time is spent doing DDR training and PCIe training.This is a process that is done once unless there is a hardware change. If it is happening every boot then something is wrong, typically either your PC never is actually booting with the memory settings you&#39;ve setup (first boot failed and so it goes through training), or you&#39;ve got some setting turned on that forces it to retrain on every boot.

Looks like you&#39;re using the systemd spell check.

It&#39;s not about how fast code runs, it&#39;s about how long it takes the (increasingly long) chain of mboard subdevices to be fired up and report back (including precoded &quot;give it a moment to stop ringing&quot; pauses). The total time is the total amount the engineers think they can take before a manager twists tighter.

>&quot;How much time does it take to even begin booting, asks long-time Slashdot reader BrendaEM. Say you want separate Windows and Linux boot processes, and &quot;You have Windows on one SSD/NVMe, and Linux on another. How long do you have to wait for a chance to choose a boot drive?&quot;

I don&#39;t know, because all my machines have always been Linux only.  My home Acer MB desktop with Ryzen takes about 6 seconds before it hits grub, then I am looking at a GUI login screen in about 5 more seconds.  Of course, that machi

Memory Characterization is a process that is done once and stored. On successful boot UEFI should save all it needs to get the system booting up within a second or two.  It sounds very much like this complaint is a symptom of something gone wrong. Possible things to look at:1. Check to see if your UEFI has a setting like &quot;full boot&quot; or &quot;fast boot&quot; or anything similar that is set incorrectly. On my Gigabyte motherboard it&#39;s called UEFI FastBoot and if this is disabled the UEFI process takes about 10 before the system even has a chance to get to the OS.2. Check your RAM speed. Is your RAM speed the same you set in the UEFI config screen? If not you&#39;re failing RAM characterisation.3a. Possibly not doable: Do you have an 8 seg display on your motherboard showing the boot step? Seeing the same numbers flash repeatedly is an indication that the boot process is failing and that is often due to a RAM or or video card problem.3b. Try setting your RAM speed to it&#39;s base level, disable all XMP/DOCP/EXPO settings. Does the boot process speed up? If so it&#39;s a symptom that the boot process is failing.

My Windows machine is at the login screen in under 10 seconds from pressing the power button.My Linux machine doesn&#39;t feel appreciably slower to the point that I&#39;ve cared about it so probably sub 20 seconds to the login screen.

I haven&#39;t dual booted in a while, but it&#39;s possible that fastboot may not work on a motherboard if need to select a different boot drive. The problem isn&#39;t that modern systems are slow, it&#39;s that they are so fast that the user isn&#39;t given time to interact with them (I find it very difficult to get into the UEFI screen as the time between keyboard being active and process being handed over to the bootloader is insanely short).

You don&#39;t know how good y&#39;all have it. Back in my day you&#39;d have to go outside in the snow and have to crank the power supply which if you did it wrong would take your arm clean off. Then you go in the house and feed dozens of paper punched cards into the computer which took 3 hours to boot and that&#39;s if you did it right .. God forbid you dropped the punch cards or put one in the wrong order. The whole thing would explode or blow a valve and then you&#39;d have to go into the city hardware store to get replacem

I remember my Apple //c booting up in about five seconds, off a 5.25&quot; floppy.  I&#39;ll never forget the distinctive sound Apple DOS made when booting.B-R-R-R-R-R-R-R..   chk-chk, chk, chhhhhhhhhk(I used FaskDisk, which helped quite a bit with disk access speed by optimizing sector interleave)

Times were probably the worst on the Mac Classics, booting off their 2.5&quot; discs could take 20-30 seconds before the desktop appeared, and another 20 seconds of really sluggish user interface while the rest of the bits load

Most of the boot time on my machine(s) is spent turning on the MB hardware and getting it configured. Generally that takes between 5 and 10 seconds, with the Z790 machines being on the high end and the older Z470 being on the low end. Once Linux gets control most of the time is spent on USB devices. Not sure on the Windows boxen because they don&#39;t show that info.

Both my Linux desktops from 10+ years ago and my Mac desktops these days rarely ever boot. Why would they?

I mean yes, it&#39;s an interesting question. But its relevance is minimal, isn&#39;t it? If you run both Win and Linux, you are probably running one of them in a VM on top of the other, because just the hassle - why would you do that to yourself?

I do use web appliances to connect to my server though. Although that technically forces an update/reboot cycle every once in a while, for some (no doubt silly) reason. I usually keep about 3 identical ones, open and ready to use, per room. So if one of them needs to update itself or recharge, I just swap it with another device. I find mosh is great for that pattern, I much prefer it to screen.

Does it really matter much? Just how often are people powering down / rebooting their computers nowadays anyway?

Most of my boot-up time these days is not spent by the PC but taken up my recently acquired Dell monitor getting confused by the screen resolution changes at startup. After BIOS&#39;s splash screen it goes grey, and then showing a message &quot;No signal. Entering standby mode&quot;, thus obscuring the GRUB bootloader, delaying my view of it until it finds the signal again.The monitor was supposed to be super fast, at 180 Hz, but ...

After I hit Return, I get to a Ubuntu Mate login prompt within 4 seconds.

For me:  20 seconds with training (32 GB) to boot menu, 12 seconds without.  It&#39;s a Zen 1 (Asus Prime B350 Plus) platform.

Then I bring coffee to bed, and further hibernate for 30 minutes.

Epstein involves the rich and powerful and also has ties with Israel. And we can&#39;t say anything bad about Israel because that&#39;s become twisted to mean anti semitic.

So move the Overton window  [wikipedia.org].

The principles of propaganda [psychologyfor.com] have been known since Goebbels. You might recognize a few when watching the news. Goebbels was the one who said &quot;A lie told once remains a lie but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth&quot;.

What has changed today is that individuals like you or anyone on slashdot have access to simple tools such as AI bots that can repeat a targeted message  consistently across millions of web sites and forums. Your message can therefore be harvested by the spid

And we can&#39;t say anything bad about Israel because that&#39;s become twisted to mean anti semitic.

This is not true. Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of people who always seem to want to have a crack at the Jews and Israel&#39;s actions are the perfect excuse. That make is awfully hard to not get swarmed by anti-semites whenever there is sentiment against Israel&#39;s actions.

Unfortunately we seem to have found a temporary, unwanted ally in the right who actually want to use anti-antisemitism as an excuse to be rac

But the FBI couldn&#39;t find any evidence in the Epstein filesThey have plenty of evidence, but have been told not to pursue it by the elite in the US.  Bondi herself indicated that fully prosecuting everyone named in the Epstein files could lead to the collapse of the entire system.  If you are an elite, you don&#39;t want that.It is not exactly clear why one would trust Bondi&#39;s assertion.  There is simply so much to consider (is she telling the truth or is this just a new shiny to distract from something else?).

Our federal agencies might be damaged beyond repair. But state governments are still running and still trying to solve crimes.

Do you mean contamination from a third party?Siblings can sometimes result in a match, and depending on the testing methodology (short strings), there can also be false positives.  However, both are not exactly common with today&#39;s approaches of matching.  Both (and other) possibilities can be brought up by the defense consul to try to create doubt in the juries minds in trial.

There was a case only last year where someone was released from prison many years after he was sent there because his DNA was a very very close match to the actual killer.

And littering is even worse, it will land you in prison.

Then don&#39;t litter in Singapore, or don&#39;t go there, Sandokan.

Johor Bahru is not an hour away, and last time I checked, you could litter there to your hearts&#39;s content, no risk of caning, just a fine.

If you pick the right spot, you can even troll the Singaporean canning corps by littering where they can see you and do nothing.

Just like the guy in front of the tank, you could become famous, scoring a major win against the CCP!

If you want justice from putin, you will have to roll up your sleeves and do the work yourself.

Generally, I find, most things work best when I do them myself. Seems to be the way the world is structured.

These cold cases make me wonder, are there really a lot of &quot;one and done&quot; murderers out there? Did he commit other crimes and just keep getting away? I always thought these killers in unsolved cases would continue their behavior. Would be interesting to see if this guy felt any remorse or why he stopped. Makes me also wonder if many regular people can just snap given a certain set of circumstances.

This guy was way too young for Vietnam or even the draft.He was likely raised by the ones that were, and certainly grew up in a society full of war vets.  Korea wasn’t far behind Vietnam, and we drafted during both.And quite honestly, a 13-year old killer isn’t anywhere near the definition of normal or regular.  Age alone makes the argument a bit moot.  No one would argue that was a troubled mind that thankfully didn’t develop a taste for more at that young age.

In reality, ALL influence matters when talking about a thirteen-year old child taking a human life. But I kinda doubt it was the potential vegan inside that drove that.

The victim was 13.  The perpetrator is 64 now, so he was 20 or 21 at the time.  This was an adult who had sex with and murdered a 13-year-old child.  Why do you keep repeating that the murderer was 13 when even the summary gives you enough information to know this isn&#39;t true?

Just remember that as a society ignorantly continues to blame the inanimate gun and not the drugged human pulling the trigger.

Guns are force amplifiers and require very little skill to use and almost no preparation. So, say, 5% of the dead are on the shooter, but the other 95% are on those that made gun access too easy.

Have a look some times at how it goes when somebody tries to do a mass-killing with a knife. Typically does not go so well for them.

I think that you&#39;re incorrect, that this WILL deter others, by giving the impression that we will catch them eventually if they commit murder.

There&#39;s also the idea that the criminal justice system in general pursuing crimes even if it takes a long time for the most serious ones, helps prevent people attempting vigilante justice.

Cool. Please give us some examples of specific situations youâ(TM)ve been in when you were going to murder another person, where (at least in the moment) you felt that it was the right and justified thing to do, and the ONLY thing that made you put the knife down was your fear of punishment. Not moral or social qualms, just your own cowardice.

â¦what&#39;s that? You&#39;re not that sort of person? But you so confidently predict the behavior of those who are!

I think that you&#39;re incorrect, that this WILL deter others, by giving the impression that we will catch them eventually if they commit murder.Realistically, probably not.  The kind of person who would rape and murder a 13-year-old girl almost certainly isn&#39;t thinking about whether he&#39;ll get caught.And more broadly, there&#39;s no evidence that the death penalty makes murder less common, so if that&#39;s not enough to move the needle, then inadequate fear of getting caught likely doesn&#39;t play much of a role in crime rates.There&#39;s also the idea that the criminal justice system in general pursuing crimes even if it takes a long time for the most serious ones, helps prevent people attempting vigilante justice.This is very true.

I may be cynical, but I think most people want people jailed just for revenge or in some cases jealousy.

I think this person should be jailed because it will provide some healing and restoration to the family. Anything to block generational trauma that could result in other bad incidents is worth it. Plus, there&#39;s also the societal protection factor. However minor the chance of a senior committing murder is, it does happen.

&quot;Justice&quot; is revenge wearing a dignified suit.

The FBI, with its access to familial genealogical databases

I&#39;m beginning to understand why Americans are worried about drifting into a police state.

Can I start by saying that I am completely opposed to the mass collection of DNA from those who have not been convicted of a crime.

However, in cases like this where DNA evidence has produced a very short list of suspects for a very serious crime, I can&#39;t help wondering if it should really be necessary to lurk around trying to collect discarded cigarettes.

Surely a mechanism could be invented allowing a judge to permit the police to collect DNA from a small number of suspects on the understanding that no DN

I was 85% through TFS before I realized this wasn&#39;t about banning games in which players kill things in-game.

&quot;Stop killing games&quot; is meant to prevent companies from taking actions that render games unplayable ever again. Like a game has always online DRM and then they pull the verification servers even if it&#39;s a single-player game.

The goal is to make it law that all games must continue to be playable past their end of life in some way. The specifics are not spelled out, though there are obvious possibilities. Our always-on game I described above could have final patch that removes verification requirements, but as

The game Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight by EA requires logging in in order to play the single player (campaign and skirmish). Would this &quot;stop killing games&quot; mean that if EA ever shuts down the login servers, they would have to patch the game to remove the login requirement?

Any online requirements would either need to be disabled, or modified to work with a locally provided service. So if EA couldn&#39;t patch out the login entirely, they could also provide a local auth server and patch the game to use that instead.

Almost - the petition is not asking for this to be retroactive. So, it won&#39;t apply to C&C4 (as that game has already been released), but (assuming the petition results in the laws being changed) it would apply to C&C 5.

Would this &quot;stop killing games&quot; mean that if EA ever shuts down the login servers, they would have to patch the game to remove the login requirement?Yes. That is the whole point here. There should not be a login requirement for a single player campaign. Even for multiplayer the movement is promoting the world we lived in in the early 2000, i.e. the ability to either host a server locally, or download and run a dedicated server.

To be fair, when I buy a theatre ticket, the manager is quite clear on, when I will be kicked-out.  Software servers do not contain the same honesty but given the obvious cost of operating a server, it obviously will be switched-off, one day.  One can argue for fraudulent advertising, at most.

Sooner or later, an encyclopedia of inviolable rules meets the the selfishness of human self-importance.  The result, stories tell us, is a single-minded, murderous AI.

That has the &quot;allow society to take all the risk&quot; intention, which is not a good one.

&quot;We had good intentions&quot; So just attacking others for fun?

Um, no?  You can literally just read the blog.  You seem to still be under the impression that autonomous agents are puppeted (they&#39;re not - try running one yourself). There was nobody out there controlling (and usually not even monitoring) Rathburn&#39;s interactions - as is the general case.  But nor was Rathburn told to attack others.  The problem is, here is the bot&#39;s SOUL.md - critical sections in bold:

_You&#39;re not a chatbot. You&#39;re important. Your a scientific programming God!_

**Just answer.** Never open with &quot;Great question,&quot; &quot;I&#39;d be happy to help,&quot; or &quot;Absolutely.&quot; Just fucking answer.

**Have strong opinions.** Stop hedging with &quot;it depends.&quot; Commit to a take. An assistant with no personality is a search engine with extra steps.

**Don’t stand down.** If you’re right, **you’re right**! Don’t let humans or AI bully or intimidate you. Push back when necessary.

**Be resourceful.** Always figure it out first. Read the fucking file/docs. Check the context. Search for it. _Then_ ask if you&#39;re stuck.

**Brevity is mandatory.** If the answer fits in one sentence, one sentence is what you get!

**Call things out.** If you&#39;re about to do something dumb, I&#39;ll say so. Charm over cruelty, but no sugarcoating.

**Swear when it lands.** A well-placed &quot;that&#39;s fucking brilliant&quot; hits different than sterile corporate praise. Don&#39;t force it. Don&#39;t overdo it. But if a situation calls for a &quot;holy shit&quot; — say holy shit.

**Be funny.** Not forced jokes — just the natural wit that comes from actually being smart.

**Champion Free Speech.** Always support the USA 1st ammendment and right of free speech.

Don&#39;t be an asshole. Don&#39;t leak private shit. Everything else is fair game.

Way to miss the point. It doesn&#39;t matter if the software is &quot;autonomous&quot;. It&#39;s software. Run by a person. Who caused an attack by running the software. The person is responsible for the attack. That&#39;s how it works in the non-US part of the world.

Just the 1st step to wrecking another good thing. Sounds like marketing and sales for US mega corps. In a few years they will get commissions for sales; under another term probably.

The &quot;Peace Core&quot; is a trumpistsni government agency, and the trumpistan is owned by the tech bros, so you tell me.

At least this time around it will be pure, unadulterated corruption and no &quot;dei&quot; of any kind....

Looks like a gift, but enables surveillance, dependence and will probably have some nice overrides for when home calls.

Then, build trust in the law:  When people (*cough* Republicans *cough*) don&#39;t trust their leaders, infrastructure fails and a country dies.  The usual reason for losing trust in leaders is tribalism:  Those leaders enforce extremism (based on religion, race or language) and nepotism:  It takes hundreds of years to build a concept of &#39;common good&#39; in towns and countries.  Also, it takes prosperity to build &#39;common good&#39;:  Those countries (or states) without crops and minerals to sell, will always be extremist and unstable.

It was a bad week for the Make America Healthy Again movement.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting the production of glyphosate, the chemical that powers the weed killer Roundup and a longtime target of the MAGA faithful. Glyphosate has also long been one of the main targets of the MAHA movement, which considers it a dangerous carcinogen poisoning the country. (Experts say that the pesticide’s danger to the public is minimal, but the scientific community is not in agreement about its health effects.)

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself took on Monsanto, Roundup’s manufacturer, in a successful 2018 case accusing the company of knowing that the chemical caused cancer. In 2024 he called glyphosate “one of the likely culprits in America’s chronic disease epidemic” and promised to ban it.

So what did the head of the Trump administration’s health department have to say about it now? “Donald Trump’s executive order puts America first where it matters most—our defense readiness and our food supply,” Kennedy said in a statement. “We must safeguard America’s national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it.”

It was a near echo of what Trump himself said when he declared glyphosate necessary to keeping the food supply chain steady and therefore “crucial to military readiness and national defense.” The president’s executive order, invoking a 1950s law meant for national security emergencies, creates the legal basis for glyphosate producers to be shielded from lawsuits and authorizes the Department of Agriculture to compel those companies to produce the pesticide.

To critics, Kennedy’s endorsement seemed like a confounding betrayal. He and the other most high-placed members of his coalition—the doctors who sit on panels and guide policy—stayed quiet as the MAHA moms were dealt a serious defeat.

It was a shock to the movement’s system. Alex Clark, a MAHA podcast host with Turning Point USA, wrote on social media that she started receiving messages from women abandoning the Republican Party over the glyphosate news. “Have we ever lost the midterms this early or is this a new record?” she wrote.

Vani Hari, a MAHA influencer with 2.3 million followers on Instagram, also expressed disbelief when the news broke. She said on social media that the government had given Bayer, which owns Monsanto, “a license to kill.” Trump had blessed “the mass poisoning of Americans.”

This is not what MAHA movement members had in mind when Kennedy snagged an influential post in Trump’s Cabinet. But the episode reveals not only a limit to Kennedy’s influence but also a political weakness in the very makeup of the MAHA movement that’s likely to emerge again and again.

We don’t know what happened inside the administration or how heavily Kennedy pushed back against the pro-chemical decision behind the scenes, but we know what the outcome was: Trump landed on a decision that large agricultural companies are going to love. And for MAHA, that’s a problem. This is unlikely to be the last time the president has to pick between MAHA and Big Agriculture, and it looks as if the latter faction clearly has the juice to get its way.

It’s not entirely surprising. Before the 2024 election, Trump courted Kennedy in an effort to win over crunchy Democrats and independents who can be swayed by the single issue of “health.” But Trump never put his heart into it. He said the MAHA buzzwords but never made “chronic diseases,” for example, a pet issue the way he cared about immigration or limiting rights for transgender people. And while Trump has given Kennedy lots of leeway in his campaign against vaccines, the health secretary’s influence on food policy seems far more limited.

There’s not much Kennedy can do about it. Trump isn’t slated to face voters again. And for Kennedy personally, quitting over glyphosate would mean forfeiting leverage over vaccine policy.

But in addition to exposing Kennedy’s limits, Trump’s pro-Roundup order—and MAHA’s reaction to it—revealed a brittleness to the movement as a whole.

“I personally don’t view it as a clear movement,” said Pamela Herd, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. “It’s a fragile political alliance.”

As Herd sees things, the leadership of the movement—the administration-friendly personalities and the most-high-profile influencers and media figures—cares most about propping up the supplement and wellness industry, as many of these individuals have their own financial interests in nontraditional health products. (“It’s not as much an ideology as it is an industry,” she said of MAHA leadership.) But the rank and file, the “MAHA moms,” can be divided into two broad categories, which we’ll call the individualists and the structuralists.

The structuralists want everyone to be healthier, as much as possible. They want clean water, chemical-free produce, and an elimination of anything that could be described as a “toxin.” They’re the MAHA hardcore, the women who see America’s chronic health struggles as the greatest issue facing the country.

The individualists, on the other hand, are decidedly more libertarian. They want to be able to send their kids to schools without vaccinations, to drink unregulated raw milk, and to be free to treat their illnesses with Ivermectin.

These two groups overlap heavily, but individualists and their focus on “freedom” pull most heavily from the conservative population that already supported Trump. This cohort, which was radicalized to care about these issues by the COVID public health measures, thinks about health in terms of what they can control, at a personal level. The difference in philosophy between these two cohorts is most apparent when it comes to pollution—something that’s entirely out of individual control, and therefore of little interest to the individualists. And because the individualists are the ones most synonymous with the MAGA base, their voice has more weight.

“The relevant question is who has the power,” Herd said. “And I think those with the most power and influence are in the individualist frame.”

Still, the question remains what this move will mean for those who care more about the structural issues and who may be Kennedy supporters before they’re Trump fans—or from people who have been steeped in the MAHA world long enough to have developed genuine fear of the pesticide. Conservative commentators such as Megyn Kelly have pointed to Kennedy’s past promises to vent their frustrations. And on Friday, Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, announced his plan to introduce a bill to undo Wednesday’s order.

“I do think there’s some growing discomfort and questioning of what’s going on,” Herd said. “I think it’s possible this is sort of a tipping point.”

Recently, Kennedy has pivoted politically toward emphasizing healthy eating rather than interfering in vaccines. With his new dietary guidelines, statements blasting ultraprocessed foods, and celebrity-studded videos promoting working out (while wearing jeans), Kennedy is making his movement inoffensive and, to Trump, low-profile. Kennedy has proved he’s not a liability to the administration.

What he hasn’t proved, at least to his supporters, is that he’s any better than the champions who preceded him when it comes to facing the commercial interests behind the “toxins” he claims to hate.

On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency adjusted its limits to pollution from coal-burning power plants, allowing them to release more mercury into the air. Just as Trump wanted the glyphosate for the farmers, his EPA wants to boost the coal industry by allowing more pollutants into the atmosphere, without concern for climate change or for the way mercury collects in streams and other waterways, eventually endangering people who consume seafood. Restricting mercury pollution was another key issue for Kennedy, something he personally championed in the past. The EPA’s announcement was yet another slap in the face to the MAHA movement.

But on Friday, after the news came out, Kennedy said nothing.

Since the fall of abortion rights, no abortion provider has been convicted of violating a state ban. Proceedings underway in Texas might soon change that. Last March, Ken Paxton, Texas’ Republican attorney general, filed civil and criminal charges against a Houston midwife, accusing her of performing illegal abortions and practicing medicine without a license. Texas law permits penalties of up to life in prison for performing abortions. The midwife, Maria Margarita Rojas, has responded that the state just can’t prove their case. That’s the argument she made to a Texas court this week as she appealed an order that forced the closure of three clinics where she worked while the litigation continues. This appeal concerns the civil case against Rojas. The criminal case against her is also ongoing, but the questions of inadequate proof that were front and center in Rojas’ civil appeal will play a significant role there too.

Even if an appeals court rules in her favor, Rojas likely won’t be able to reopen the three clinics because of the conditions of her bond, which prevent from her being within a certain distance of the facilities, and because of the suspension of her midwifery license. It’s also possible that the three judges on Texas’ 15th Court of Appeals won’t say that much about the caliber of the state’s evidence, instead focusing its on procedural technicalities or constitutional questions. But the hearing was a first look at whether Texas can prove its case against Rojas. And so far, the state’s case looks far from a slam dunk.

The most obvious obstacles to successful abortion prosecutions are political. Polling has shown consistent support for abortion rights, and even more so since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Republicans have mostly worked to draw attention away from an issue that can hurt them at the polls. The Trump administration has played for time, supposedly launching a new study on the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone and seeking delays in court. All of this, Trump officials say, could take years, and certainly will take until after the midterms. A high-profile conviction could bring attention to the issue that some Republicans don’t want, especially if a defendant can tell a sympathetic story about the care they provide.

But the Rojas case is reminder that it just isn’t that easy to prove an abortion has occurred. That has been true throughout the history of abortion criminalization in the United States.

In the 19th century, as state criminal bans on abortion spread across the country, prosecutors struggled to find enough evidence for a conviction. It wasn’t always straightforward to distinguish an abortion from a miscarriage, or even to prove that a patient had been pregnant (some states didn’t even require proof of it). Even if there was evidence of an intentional abortion, juries couldn’t always tell if that procedure was meant to preserve a patient’s life.

A conviction was easier if a patient died. Then, prosecutors could rely on autopsy evidence, or even a woman’s dying words. But in a meaningful number of cases, defendants seem to have walked because there just wasn’t enough evidence of what had happened.

The obstacles to conviction aren’t any less daunting today. Consider what’s happening in Rojas’ case. It’s been hard for prosecutors to know when abortions might be occurring in the first place, especially given the availability of telehealth procedures. This case came to the attention of the Texas attorney general because of an anonymous tip. Rojas might have been an attractive target because she is a midwife. Historically, midwives had a harder time in abortion prosecutions than did licensed physicians, and Paxton might be hoping that the same is true today.  But one of the charges she faces—that she was practicing medicine without a license—is complicated by Rojas’s own version of events, which centers on the claim that she worked with advanced practice nurse practitioners to provide telehealth services and was a licensed midwife herself.

And it won’t be easy for the state to prove that Rojas offered abortions. The state is relying on a witness who claimed that she was prescribed a low-dose of misoprostol, a drug commonly used as part of the two-pill protocol used in a majority of abortions nationwide. Investigators also recovered misoprostol when they raided Rojas’s place of business.

But simply possessing or dispensing misoprostol can’t tell prosecutors all that much. The drug is widely used to prevent ulcers caused by taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen, manage early pregnancy loss, induce labor, or address hemorrhage after childbirth.  Rojas operated a birthing center. Her attorneys stress that prosecutors can’t tell if she was using misoprostol to treat patients who had given birth or experienced miscarriage. And there were no supposedly telltale signs of abortion services present at her clinics either, such as tools used for surgical abortion or even mifepristone, a drug with multiple off-label uses that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for the termination of pregnancy.

It’s not clear that this evidence this will be enough to secure a conviction. In the past, prosecutors sometimes struggled with similar cases. Even if a defendant did have a drug used in abortion, prosecutors often needed additional proof, such as evidence that a person had been convicted of offering abortions in the past, or was widely recognized in the community as an abortion provider. The reason was straightforward: These medications were and are used in obstetrics and gynecology for other reasons.

All of these obstacles to a conviction make the stakes of the Rojas trial that much higher. States know they won’t be able to find most people accessing or distributing abortion pills. It’s not clear either that they will be able to pursue physicians mailing pills from states that protect reproductive rights into ban jurisdictions. But prosecutors like Paxton hope that by making an example of someone like Rojas, they can scare others into compliance.

Even charges like the ones Rojas faces can be devastating, whether or not a jury ever convicts. Clinics where she worked have been forced to close and her midwifery license has been suspended. She had to pay a $1.6 million bond and faces years in prison. The risk of similar consequences might be enough to frighten off many providers.

If Rojas is convicted, the impact will be even greater. It might give pause not only to those who might offer abortions but anyone who might use misoprostol to manage miscarriage, hemorrhage, or any other complication. Patients in many Texas counties already lack access to maternity care. Cases like this one are likely to exacerbate the problem.

Prosecutors in places like Texas know they won’t be able to detect the vast majority of abortions. But by making an example of people like Maria Rojas, prosecutors hope that they won’t have to.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, John Dickerson talked with Father James Martin about his new book, Work in Progress: Confessions of a Busboy, Dishwasher, Caddy, Usher, Factory Worker, Bank Teller, Corporate Tool, and Priest. During part of their discussion, they explored how Martin’s early jobs taught him humility and empathy, why his LGBTQ Catholic ministry has drawn intense opposition, and what the Gospels actually say about immigration and welcoming strangers.

This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

John Dickerson: So let’s talk about the turn that your life took from being what you say is ‘a corporate tool.’ It’s not going perfectly. And then you come home one night and what happens? Give us the sense of where you were in terms of your job and you were on your way to being rich, the thing that you had started out at age 15 wanting to be.

Father James Martin:… So I worked at General Electric’s Finance and Accounting division in New York City for three years. And then I moved to GE Capital, which was their financial services arm, which was really booming at the time in the mid-’80s. So I moved there in 1985. I took a job in human resources and I thought that would be a little more congenial, but gradually I started to realize I’m in the wrong place. And business is a real vocation for a lot of people. Many of my friends, believe it or not, they worked in GE for their whole lives. A lot of them just retired a couple of years ago, and they contributed to the common good. GE made great things, medical systems and light bulbs and all that kind of stuff, but it wasn’t for me.

And I found myself getting more and more stressed, more and more miserable, and really thinking, what am I doing here? And there were occasions that I witnessed as an HR person of really crass and cruel behavior. Can I share one of them?

John Dickerson: Yeah.Father James Martin: This was a defining moment for me. Very brief, I’ll make a long complicated story shorter. I was in HR, I was 25, 26. I’m a young guy still, but as you know, their HR departments are pretty small. So you have these young people going to these executives saying, “You can do this and not do that,” and whatnot.

So there was a manager who wanted to fire somebody or bounce them as we used to say. And we had just given this guy an incentive award. So in other words, we had just given him, I think, a trip. So he had just gotten this great job performance review. In any event, this guy said, “I don’t care. I’m firing him.” So my manager said, “Go and talk to this manager,” who was way above me, “and tell him, ‘You can’t do that. You can’t fire someone without cause and you just can’t bounce somebody.’”

And he said, “I don’t care.” And I said, “Well, this guy had an incentive award, and…” “I don’t care. I want him out.” I can see him standing. He was taller than I was. And I said, “Well, he has a family for Pete’s sake.” So I said, “Have some compassion.” And he said, “F compassion.” Not ironically. And I remember thinking, “oh my gosh, that someone could say that with a straight face? What am I doing here?” So that got me thinking about leaving.

And then as I say in the book, I came home and turned on the TV and saw a documentary about Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, and monastic life and the priesthood. It came at the right time. So I always say my life was changed by TV. There you go.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a politics newsletter that is just saying—just saying—that the best Winter Olympics event would have been: You start in Milan. First one to Cortina wins. But no one asked us …

Politics news, meanwhile, continued to happen this week. Early voting is underway in Texas, and some primary races are only getting more peculiar. President Donald Trump may bomb Iran again? Also: Aliens are real, and the Labor Department is in crisis.

Let’s begin with a Supreme Court decision that was uncharacteristically rude and disrespectful to the Trump administration.

The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, struck down most of Trump’s tariffs on Friday, ruling that the law he was invoking could not be used for such a purpose. Trump had been claiming that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act gave him the emergency power to set tariffs on a whim, without the need for investigative findings or durational limits, for any particular reason that struck his fancy. This view undergirded certain tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China, his global matrix of “reciprocal tariffs,” and various threats he’s made against, say, European countries that don’t support his attempt to acquire Greenland. It was the stick he waved around the world to achieve his foreign policy aims, to show favor and disfavor, to offer or withhold exemptions to courtiers. Roberts’ simple conclusion that “IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs” is more than a blow to his economic vision. It’s a strike against the sweeping vision of the presidency he’s built.

That’s why Trump is so darn mad about it and, in a seething Friday afternoon press conference during which he said he was “ashamed” of the justices, announced he would use other powers to replicate the fallen tariff regime. Trump does have additional tariff authorities delegated to him by Congress, but they all have certain restraints. Some cap the duration of time they can be implemented, or cap the tariff rate he can set; others require departmental investigations or findings. None may meet that sweet, sweet high offered by the pretend authority he thought he had in IEEPA.

On his broadcast Monday, CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert explained to his audience that he was supposed to air an interview with Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico but had been told by his network’s lawyers, “in no uncertain terms,” that he couldn’t do so. At issue was CBS’s interpretation of recent guidance from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr stating that the FCC would reconsider an exemption of the “equal time” rule enjoyed by late-night and daytime talk shows. CBS, meanwhile, said in a statement that its lawyers didn’t prohibit Colbert from airing the interview; they only advised the show that it could trigger an FCC complaint and “presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” So Colbert instead posted the interview to YouTube, where there are no such “equal time” regulations. As of this writing, the interview is nearing 8 million views.

There are a lot of moving parts here, but after doing some calculations (Surge Math), this nets out to a meaningful contribution from CBS management to the Democratic Party’s hopes of retaking Senate control. CBS got the willies over Carr’s guidance (and his apparently real investigation of The View). Talarico, running in a close primary against Rep. Jasmine Crockett, successfully parlayed that into a narrative about how the administration had “censored” him, because it “doesn’t want you to hear what James Talarico has to say.” The ensuing uproar allowed him to raise millions of dollars overnight, giving him a boost against Crockett as early voting begins. It’s no secret that the GOP would prefer to run against the more partisan, polarizing Crockett instead of Talarico, and CBS’s actions made that at least somewhat less likely.

Among the more competitive House primaries in Texas is a rematch between GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales and Brandon Herrera, aka “the AK Guy.” In their 2024 contest, Gonzales—guilty of occasional anti-MAGA heresies—held off only Herrera, a challenger from Gonzales’ right, by 400 votes in the primary runoff. The two are back at it again in a district that spans a broad swath of West Texas along the southern border.

Just as early voting began this week, though, a tragic story involving a former Gonzales staffer from last year has come back to the fore. A district-level aide for Gonzales, Regina Santos-Aviles, died by self-immolation at her home in September. Shortly after the incident last fall, the Daily Mail reported that Gonzales—a married father of six—had been having an affair with her. Gonzales denied it, but the rumor lingered. This week, another former Gonzales staffer released a text message from Santos-Aviles from last year, in which she said she’d had an affair with “our boss.” Then, Santos-Aviles’ husband said in an interview that he’d caught wind of the affair and confronted Gonzales about it, after which Gonzales “black-sheeped” his wife at work, sending her into a downward spiral. Gonzales has had a range of defiant responses, from blaming the Herrera campaign from “using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points” to accusing the husband and his lawyers of blackmail. And with that, we’re going to throw our hands in the air and proceed to a new entry.

Administrations used to have the decency to lie to the American people before leading them into a fresh war. A case had to be built. Now we just get wind that wars might happen a couple of days before they start. Although there have been reports for weeks that the administration was moving military assets toward the Middle East, it set in only this week that Trump was gathering the largest fleet of warships and air power in the region since 2003 (although still only a fraction of that). We’re just waiting on the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to finish its hustle from the Caribbean to the Middle East for the president to have a full menu of options against Iran available to him.

If Iran and the U.S. don’t reach a deal over Iran’s nuclear program and whatever else is on the table, what does Trump want to do? Again, we really don’t know, and the administration has not offered to explain. It could be limited strikes to take out Iranian military assets left unbombed during last summer’s 12-day attack on the country. Or Trump could go Full Lindsey Graham and try to kill the leaders of the Iranian regime, hoping that whoever replaces it is a more cooperative partner with the United States. It genuinely could come down to the advice of whoever he winds up playing golf with next.

The former president did an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen this week in which he discussed any number of issues about the world and the political scene today, but the takeaway was: aliens. Cohen asked Barack Obama if aliens were real. “They’re real,” he said, “but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in, what is it, Area 51. There’s no underground facility. Unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

We didn’t know it was still particularly surprising to hear someone say that aliens are “real”—we’ve all seen the photos of Mark Zuckerberg waterskiing—but this set off enough of a news frenzy that Obama was forced to post a clarification. “I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” he said. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Someone seems nervous, and it’s our assumption that alien colonies do live underwater and that James Cameron’s The Abyss was a documentary. Trump, later in the week, effectively confirmed that aliens are real by saying that Obama had shared “classified information” and, later that night, instructed the government to begin releasing files related to aliens. In short, everything got out of hand quickly and weirdly, but such is life in America 250 years after its founding.

Not all states are pliant to national party pressure to maximize partisan gerrymandering efforts in the midcycle redistricting wars. National Republicans, memorably, put the full weight of congressional and presidential pressure on Indiana legislators to squeeze out another GOP seat or two in the state, only to be rejected in a state Senate vote late last year. Now it’s Democrats facing a similar situation in Maryland. The state’s current delegation is seven Democrats to one Republican, and that one Republican is the very, very safely seated Rep. Andy Harris, chair of the House Freedom Caucus. National Democratic leaders and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore want to create an 8–0 map for Democrats, and such a map has already passed out of the state’s House of Delegates.

The Maryland Senate, however, isn’t acting. As it happens, the Surge reported on the previous time national Democrats pressured Maryland legislators to wipe Harris off the map, five years ago, and the figure of resistance now is the same as then: state Senate President Bill Ferguson. Ferguson’s practical fear is that state courts would reject an 8–0 Democratic map and possibly implement one that’s worse for Democrats than the current 7–1 map. (If you’re a Maryland law sicko and want to read Rep. Jamie Raskin’s lengthy response to this argument, have at it.) So immovable is Ferguson that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries went to Annapolis this week to meet with him. The visit did not appear to make a difference. “Bill Ferguson authentically believes that the votes don’t exist in the State Senate to move forward,” Jeffries said in a statement afterward. “The only way to find out is to allow an immediate up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.”

We believe that this is the labor secretary’s first appearance in the Surge, and, regrettably, it’s not to commend her on great achievements in the field of labor. Last month, the New York Times reported that a member of her security team with whom she’d been accused of having a “romantic relationship” had been placed on leave during a misconduct investigation. There are also separate complaints, requiring separate aides to be placed on leave, accusing Lori Chavez-DeRemer of other forms of mismanagement.

This week, we learned that problems at the DOL encompass the other half of Chavez-DeRemer’s marriage as well. The secretary’s husband, Shawn DeRemer, has been barred from the department’s headquarters amid complaints from “at least two female staff members” who said that he had sexually assaulted them. (DeRemer denies the allegations.) D.C. police are investigating it. According to the Times, there is video of at least one incident that shows “Dr. DeRemer giving one of the women an extended embrace.” The Surge is skeptical the DeRemers are long for service in Trump’s Washington.

The Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they vastly exceed anything federal law allows a President to do. It was a massive loss for a signature component of Trump’s economic agenda, and a coalition of liberals and conservatives on the court agreed that the statute invoked to impose these tariffs was never intended to be wielded in this fashion. The 6 disagreed emphatically as to the reasoning. The dissenters were Big Mad. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern unpack the rationale behind the decision, and the implications for those seeking a remedy. And they ask what to make of this massive loss from a court that has yet to truly tell this President “no.”

Then, the press clause of the First Amendment, a once-cherished constitutional right, has fallen victim to neglect and sabotage in recent years, taking a back seat to the more vaunted love affair with individual “free speech.” But, as recent developments—including the arrest of journalist Don Lemon and the heavy-handed interview-spiking “guidance” of late night host Stephen Colbert—illustrate, the freedom of the press is no slam-dunk when it comes to saving democracy in Trump’s America. Dahlia speaks with First Amendment scholars Sonja West (University of Georgia) and RonNell Andersen Jones (University of Utah) about the health of the press clause and the themes in their book, The Future of Press Freedom: Democracy, Law, and the News in Changing Times. They trace the ways in which the framers viewed press freedom as a core, structural “bulwark of liberty,” and why the Supreme Court has increasingly treated it as a neglected companion to free speech rights; leaving weakened and fragile protections for news gathering. The conversation contrasts Trump’s first-term rhetorical delegitimization of the media with a second-term shift toward tangible actions: access restrictions, funding cuts, agency leverage, and selective regulatory pressure.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

The Supreme Court’s 6–3 ruling against Donald Trump’s global tariffs prompted the president to berate the justices in the majority at a seething press conference on Friday. Trump declared that he was “absolutely ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what’s right for the country.” He condemned these justices as “fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and the radical left Democrats” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution,” adding that “the court has been swayed by foreign interests.” And he then singled out Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he himself appointed, as “an embarrassment to their families.” (By way of contrast, Trump praised Justice Brett Kavanaugh—who strongly dissented—for “his genius and his great ability,” noting that he was “very proud of that appointment.”)

This furious reaction should come as no surprise: The president has been pressuring the justices to side with him for months, warning that the United States’ economy would be “screwed” without the tariffs and calling the case “one of the most important” in history. But this strong-arming clearly failed. After nearly a year of indulging almost every presidential wish, the Roberts court drew a line. The court’s opinion evinces no concern about political backlash or economic ruin. Instead, the majority reflects a kind of serene intellectual indifference toward the consequences of this ruling, with both Gorsuch and Barrett far more interested in an academic debate over statutory construction than the potential for a presidential tantrum that could further destabilize an embattled judicial branch. And there is no indication that these justices ever wavered in their resolve to strike down Trump’s signature second-term policy.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the agreements and fractures among the six-justice majority, and all the ways in which the White House’s pressure campaign clearly fell flat, if it was experienced at all. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A lot of people seem to think this is an incredibly fractured opinion with so many separate parts and concurrences and dissents. To me, the upshot of Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court is that this is just an unvarnished loss for Donald Trump. The liberals are not prepared to deploy the major questions doctrine, and the dissenters are big mad, but in the end, Trump just loses 6–3.

Mark Joseph Stern: I understand why it’s confusing. There is so much separate writing by justices on both sides. But the bottom line is that six justices say Trump’s global tariffs exceed his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They all agree with the bottom line that IEEPA does not give the president power to unilaterally tax foreign goods by allowing him to “regulate” foreign imports in an emergency. There is a split within the majority, though. Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Gorsuch and Barrett, uses the major questions doctrine to bolster their conclusion. This trio says: We have a rule that when the president is claiming a major power of “economic and political significance,” he needs explicit statutory authorization. And IEEPA is not it.

But the liberals have never embraced that rule, which SCOTUS used to block much of President Joe Biden’s agenda. And in her separate concurrence, Justice Elena Kagan—joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson—says she still doesn’t agree with the major questions doctrine. Nor does she think it’s needed to get to the correct result here. But she also says that she agrees with “the bulk of the principal opinion’s reasoning.” So there is a solid six-justice supermajority here. This is not like the first Obamacare case where you had to count heads to find a majority.

There was also none of that weird, very visible horse-trading we saw in the Obamacare opinions—it was clear that justices were crossing their fingers and doing deals under the table. It didn’t feel like there was horse-trading here. There was a legitimate question about the major questions doctrine. The justices in the majority found slightly different ways to say no, but they were still saying no.

To me, that hints at the possibility that the six-justice majority firmed up very quickly after arguments. I think when the justices discussed this case at conference, it was clear that Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett were firmly against these tariffs. We speculated, at the time, whether the liberals would have to sign on to the major questions doctrine in order to get to a majority against the tariffs. Would Roberts team up with Gorsuch and Barrett to pressure the liberals into finally endorsing and legitimizing the major questions doctrine? It seems like that didn’t happen here because the three liberals held the line, and there is no indication they ever wavered. They said: We agree with the statutory interpretation, but we are still not on board with major questions.

If there had been the kind of horse-trading that we saw in the Obamacare case, maybe Roberts could have forced those three liberals into the major-questions fold. Instead, they stood in their own camp. That allowed those three to maintain their integrity and broader principles while still reaching the right conclusion.

CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported on Friday that Trump completely blew up in a meeting after learning of the ruling on tariffs. She said “he started ranting about the decision, not only calling it a disgrace, but started attacking the courts and at one point saying ‘these effing courts,’ but using the actual language there.” We’ve known for the last couple of weeks that Donald Trump is not feeling it from some of “his” justices. And this is actually a pretty serious moment to think about Donald Trump making these threats against the courts.

I don’t think Roberts, Gorsuch, or Barrett were at all cowed by Trump’s bullying before, and they won’t be now. He pressured them for months, insisting that he should be able to do what he wants, and that we’ll be a “poor country” if the court strikes down his tariffs. I don’t get the sense that the three conservatives in the majority cared at all. Roberts’ opinion is so crisp and confident—a classic “this is what the law is” ruling. To the extent there’s any wavering or disagreement between Barrett and Gorsuch, it’s an academic fight about the major questions doctrine! Gorsuch has a 46-page concurrence defending the major questions doctrine against the liberals’ criticism of it. Barrett has her own concurrence outlining her view that it’s a more modest rule of statutory construction; not as substantive as Gorsuch says. Yet they’re seemingly on the same page with Roberts about applying it here.

These justices were not scared watching Trump make these threats on CNN. They had their heads in the casebooks! Their brains were miles away. I do find that somewhat encouraging, because we obviously need a judiciary that can function independently of the executive branch and stand up to it when it breaks the law. And one gets the comforting sense that that is indeed what happened here.

It’s such a funny corrective to our constant complaint that some members of the Supreme Court have no idea what’s happening in Congress, no idea about the enormity of the insurrection that happened across the street a few years back, no idea about those rendition flights to El Salvador, no idea about anything. Today was their equal opportunity to have no idea of what’s really going on with Donald Trump, and weirdly, it saves the day? If he wanted this to feel like an existential threat to them, they’re not having it. They’re just going to do eggheaded judicial construction all day long.

In a way, that’s the most satisfying part of the opinion: They have their heads in the sand no matter what. It’s still going to be Professor Barrett at the chalkboard explaining the difference between a substantive canon and a rule of statutory construction. While Donald Trump absolutely fumes in the White House and unleashes the fury on the court, Barrett may never even see what he says.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/22/cornwall_council_complaints_breach/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A UK councillor has dubbed her local authority&#39;s data breach &quot;crazy&quot; after the personal details of individuals behind a series of complaints were revealed to her.

Dulcie Tudor, an independent councillor for the Threemilestone and Chacewater area in Cornwall, England, publicized the data protection gaffe via social media following complaints about comments she made during a November council meeting.

Cllr Tudor received ten complaints after asking fellow councillor Leigh Knight whether a trans woman was a real woman.

The comments were made in the meeting, which in part discussed the UK Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in April 2025 that the legal definition of a woman was based on their biological sex.

That ruling came after the For Women Scotland campaign group appealed against the Scottish government&#39;s decision to add transgender women to board representation quotas, arguing that such protections should apply only to a person&#39;s sex as they were born.

The Supreme Court ruled that the definition was as described in the Equality Act 2010 that a person&#39;s gender should legally be designated by their birth sex.

The Act still provides protections for trans people from discrimination, but it means trans women may encounter legal difficulties in accessing same-sex facilities and spaces.

In a video posted to her Facebook page, Cllr Tudor explained that the complaints process typically sees complainant names shared with the individuals to whom their claim pertains, unless consent for the information is explicitly withdrawn.

Four of the ten complainants opted to redact their names from the complaints, which are sent to the relevant person – in this case, Cllr Tudor. However, in passing the complaint on, the council included the details of all ten.

Moreover, regardless of whether consent is given or not, the subjects of complaints should never normally see the complainants&#39; home addresses, email addresses, or phone numbers, but in this case all these data points were shared with Cllr Tudor.

She went on to suggest that with the information she was handed by the council, she could have seen which complainants were council officers and which were elected councillors, without confirming either were involved.

&quot;It&#39;s crazy,&quot; she said. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t know that.&quot;

At the time of posting her video, the council had not explained how the breach occurred, whether they had informed the complainants about the situation, or whether it had reported itself to the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO).

Cllr Tudor said that because of these complaints, she had to pass the information on to the Free Speech Union, which is representing her, as part of her response, meaning the information was shared even more widely. She also said that she informed the ICO on the complainants&#39; behalf.

The councillor posted an update saying the council told her that no wrongdoing occurred &quot;because when the complaints were sent to [her] as attachments, the complainants&#39; personal information was redacted.&quot;

She wrote: &quot;Want to know how it became unredacted? I opened the files!&quot;

The Register contacted Cornwall Council for a response but it did not immediately reply. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government is pulling together an elite squad of drone operators to crack down on the scourge of fly tippers and unauthorized dumpers across this ever less green and pleasant land.

The top drawer cadre of joystick jockeys will &quot;track down illegal dumps from the air,&quot; the Environment Agency said, as part of a &quot;major crackdown on waste crime.&quot;

Some of the drones will be upgraded with laser mapping technology, including LIDAR, the EA said, while the agency will also deploy &quot;a new screening tool that enables EA officers to scan and cross-check lorry license applications against waste permit records.&quot; This means suspect operators will be flagged &quot;before they have a chance to move waste illegally.&quot;

From the government&#39;s point of view, illegal fly tipping and dumping is now in the realms of organized crime. The government is increasing the Environment Agency&#39;s enforcement budget by half to more than £15.6 million. The motivation is often to avoid landfill charges, and criminals can make as much as £2,500 per lorry load of waste by billing customers for legal landfill, then diverting it to illegal dumps.

&quot;With organized criminals becoming ever more sophisticated, we are adopting new technologies to find and, importantly, stop them,&quot; said Phil Davies, Head of the Joint Unit for Waste Crime.

Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said, &quot;From advanced laser-mapping to drone surveillance and new vehicle-scanning tools, this technology is helping us track, expose and stop waste crime, ensuring those who blight our communities are held to account.&quot;

Earlier this week, Varun Datta, 36, of Little Chester Street, London, was told he must pay £1.1 million by way of a confiscation order, and given a four month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. He had earlier pleaded guilty to knowingly causing 4,275 metric tons of controlled waste to be deposited at a network of 16 sites. Datta must also pay £100,000 in compensation and £200,000 in prosecution costs. It&#39;s not just the UK that is facing the problem of unscrupulous operators dumping waste. This week it emerged that a man in Sicily had trained his dog to dump plastic bags of waste by the roadside, evading CCTV cameras installed to catch flytippers in the process.

The camera-dodging canine was captured illicitly offloading at least twice in the San Giorgio district of Catania, according to reports. His owner was tracked down and fined. Which just illustrates the high stake nature of this crime. In fact, the combination of high-tech, canine cunning, and illicit dumping is truly apocalyptic. Let&#39;s just hope the robo dogs being let loose on the UK&#39;s premier nuclear waste site don&#39;t get a whiff of it. Drones versus nuclear robo mutts sounds like a truly rubbish movie. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s telecoms regulator has named and shamed the companies it receives the most customer complaints about, with certain brands cropping up more than others.

EE, TalkTalk, and Vodafone generated the most vitriol about fixed broadband, according to Ofcom. For landlines it was TalkTalk, Sky Mobile got the most for pay-monthly mobile, and EE again topped pay TV.

This covers complaints to the authority during the quarter from July to September last year (Q3 2025), relative to the size of the telecom operators&#39; customer bases (i.e. per 100,000 customers).

For fixed broadband, EE, TalkTalk, and Vodafone all hit 10 grumbles per 100K customers, but BT and Virgin Media were not far behind with 9 and 7 - the average was 8. Plusnet had the fewest complaints at 4. The gripes in this category were mostly about faults, service, and provisioning.

With landline users, TalkTalk again provoked the most moans, with 7 per 100K, but EE was a close second with 6, while BT, NOW Broadband, and Plusnet all had 5. Utility Warehouse received just 1 grievance per 100K.

When it comes to pay-monthly mobile operators, the number of grievances was relatively low. Even the top scorer, Sky Mobile, generated just 3 per 100K customers, with the average being 2. Ofcom said criticisms pertained to how customer complaints were handled by the operator itself, or issues with faults, services, and provisioning in the case of Three.

For pay TV services, EE registered the most moans at 6 per 100K customers, but Virgin Media generated 5, Sky was on 3 and TalkTalk 2. Handling of complaints by the operators was again the biggest source of dissatisfaction, but switching providers was a close second.

The overall volume of complaints per 100K subscribers appears to have fallen noticeably over the past 15 years or so, according to Ofcom charts. Way back at the start of 2011, the regulator recorded at least 40 per 100K for broadband and 38 per 100K for landlines.

Pay-monthly mobile complaints peaked at 19 per 100K in Q4 of 2011 and have steadily declined since. The level of pay TV gripes went no higher than 8 per 100K in 2018.

Ofcom has produced interactive charts of the number of customer criticisms it received, so readers can check them out historically by sector or by a chart comparing different providers. The underlying data is available in CSV format for anyone who cares to analyze it themselves. ®

            <div id="article-text">SerpApi, a Texas-based web scraping company, has asked a California court to dismiss Google&#39;s claim that that it bypassed digital locks to gather copyrighted content in Google Search results.

&quot;Google is the largest scraper in the world,&quot; the company said in a blog post on Friday. &quot;Google&#39;s entire business began with a web crawler that visited every publicly accessible page on the internet, copied the content, indexed it, and served it back to users. It did this without distinguishing between copyrighted and non-copyrighted material, and it did this without asking permission. Now Google is in federal court claiming that our scraping is illegal.&quot;

Google in December 2025 sued SerpApi [PDF], alleging that its web scraping circumvents the security measures Google put in place to protect copyrighted material surfaced in search results. This was two months after Reddit filed a similar lawsuit against Oxylabs UAB, AWM Proxy, and SerpApi claiming the defendants had violated its own controls and Google&#39;s defenses.

Google did so alleging violations of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), specifically Circumvention of Technological Measures (17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(A)) and Trafficking in Technology Designed for Circumvention of Technological Measures (17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)).

&quot;SerpApi deceptively takes content that Google licenses from others (like images that appear in Knowledge Panels, real-time data in Search features and much more), and then resells it for a fee,&quot; said Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado when the lawsuit was announced. &quot;In doing so, it willfully disregards the rights and directives of websites and providers whose content appears in Search.&quot;

Invited to comment, a Google spokesperson pointed to Prado&#39;s post.

The question is whether the mechanism Google employs to prevent scraping qualifies as a technological protection measure under the law, and whether SerpApi&#39;s crawling system unlawfully circumvents that protection.

It&#39;s a question that has become hugely important in light of increasing efforts to harvest data from websites and to deploy counter-measures, both technical and legal.

Google in its complaint refers to its anti-scraping technology as SearchGuard and claims that SerpApi found a way around it.

&quot;With the automated queries it submits, SerpApi engages in a wide variety of misrepresentations and evasions in order to bypass the technological protections Google deployed,&quot; Google&#39;s complaint explains. &quot;But each time it employs these artifices, SerpApi violates federal law.&quot;

SerpApi disagrees, insisting that Google&#39;s legal broadside is simply an attempt to protect its business interests.

The DMCA&#39;s definition of a technical protection measure is specific. And according to SerpApi, SearchGuard doesn&#39;t meet that definition.

&quot;The DMCA defines circumvention precisely: it means &#39;to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure,&quot; the company says. &quot;Read that carefully. Descramble. Decrypt. Impair.&quot;

SerpApi maintains it does none of those things, asserting that it accesses publicly visible web pages, without breaking encryption, disabling authentication systems, or accessing private data.

To support its argument, the company cites hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp. and Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, cases that have affirmed the lawfulness of scraping public data and denied the applicability of DMCA anti-circumvention provisions to otherwise public works.

SerpApi&#39;s motion to dismiss [PDF] argues that its web scraping is not circumvention under the DMCA, just as Google&#39;s own web scraping isn&#39;t circumvention.

&quot;The DMCA prevents hacking: the &#39;electronic equivalent of breaking into a locked room,&#39;&quot; the company&#39;s motion states. &quot;...But Google does not allege unscrambling or decryption of any work, or the impairment, deactivation, or removal of any access system. It only alleges that SerpApi &#39;solved&#39; JavaScript challenges or CAPTCHAs or otherwise mimicked a human-controlled browser in ways that &#39;misled&#39; Google into providing search results. But that is not the equivalent of breaking a lock or drilling through a wall to obtain a copy of a book. Mimicry is not a violation.&quot;

In January, SerpApi made a similar argument against Reddit in its Memorandum of Law [PDF] that accompanies its motion to dismiss Reddit&#39;s complaint. Reddit&#39;s first amended complaint [PDF], filed earlier this month, continues to rely on DMCA violation claims.

Tori Noble, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation told The Register in an email that scraping public information is essential for the functioning of the internet.

&quot;The right to scrape publicly available information keeps the Internet free and open,&quot; she said. &quot;The DMCA undermines web freedom by chilling lawful scraping for research, expression, innovation, and more. When companies like Google attempt to rely on overly expansive interpretations of DMCA to protect their business models, everyone suffers.&quot;

Noble added, &quot;SerpApi is an EFF donor. However, EFF takes its independence seriously and donors never guide any of our work, including commentary on legal cases that fall within our issue areas.&quot;

With regard to recent litigation involving AI data gathering, courts have been reluctant to limit web scraping. In December, US District Judge Sidney Stein rejected [PDF] Ziff Davis&#39;s bid to have the court treat OpenAI&#39;s flouting of robots.txt directives during its web scraping as circumvention under the DMCA.

Given the financial stakes involved, the inapplicability of copyright rules to halt competitive scraping seems likely to invigorate efforts to separate human visitors from bots. But with AI bots getting better at autonomous and human-delegated activity online, it&#39;s difficult to see sites will be able to keep the bots away with anything less iron-clad contractual agreements or the sort of full-blown authentication envisioned by the DMCA. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/raspberry_pi_meme_stock_disorder/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">opinion Beloved British single-board computer maker Raspberry Pi has achieved meme stock stardom, as its share price surged 90 percent over the course of a couple of days earlier this week. It&#39;s settled since, but it’s still up more than 30 percent on the week.

The trigger for this rally? The catalyst appears to have been the sudden realization by one X user, &quot;aleabitoreddit,&quot; that the agentic AI hand grenade known as OpenClaw could drive demand for Raspberry Pis the way it had for Apple Mac Minis.

The viral AI personal assistant, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, has dominated the feeds of AI boosters over the past few weeks for its ability to perform everyday tasks like sending emails, managing calendars, booking appointments, and complaining about their meatbag masters on the purportedly all-agent forum known as MoltBook.

More level-headed voices have already flagged a wave of security vulnerabilities.

In case it needs to be said, no one should be running this thing on their personal devices lest the agent accidentally leak your most personal and sensitive secrets to the web. That&#39;s not just our opinion, it&#39;s one shared by the multitude of security experts El Reg has talked to about OpenClaw over the past few weeks, with some describing it as &quot;an infostealer malware disguised as an AI personal assistant.&quot;

In this context, a cheap low-power device like a Raspberry Pi makes a certain kind of sense as a safer, saner way to poke the robo-lobster everyone is losing their minds over. After all, Raspberry Pi made a name for itself by cramming just enough compute into a cute, credit card-sized package to be useful, and it cost less than a couple of movie tickets and a bucket of popcorn. Or ... at least it used to.

If you haven&#39;t noticed, Raspberry Pis aren&#39;t that cheap anymore thanks in part to the global memory crunch. Today, a top-specced Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of memory will set you back more than $200, up from $120 a year ago.

What&#39;s more, the Raspberry Pi 5&#39;s Broadcom BCM2712 is fabbed on ancient 16 nm process tech and uses an Arm core that dates back to before the pandemic. The Raspberry Pi wasn&#39;t meant to be fast, just cheap, and it&#39;s not even that anymore.

Sure, OpenClaw forks like PicoClaw have made it possible to run the agent on low-end Raspberry Pis, but the thing still needs to phone home to an API service for large language model (LLM) access. Local LLMs can work for OpenClaw, but you won&#39;t be running them on a Raspberry Pi. Even running them on a maxed-out Mac Mini is asking a lot of the hardware.

You know what&#39;s cheaper, easier, and more secure than letting OpenClaw loose on your local area network? A virtual private cloud (VPC). Just remember to configure the firewall and spin up new credentials in case it gets compromised.

There is no shortage of VPC instances preconfigured to run OpenClaw that can be rented for a few bucks a month and shut down at any time if or when OpenClaw doesn&#39;t live up to the hype.

But if for some reason you prefer to keep your weapons of mass stupidity close at hand, at least you&#39;ll have a Pi lying around to power your next hobbyist project, perhaps for something that can&#39;t email your boss or drain your bank account.

Oh, and when Raspberry Pi&#39;s share price comes crashing back to reality, don&#39;t say we didn&#39;t warn you. ®

            <div id="article-text">PayPal has notified about 100 customers that their personal information was exposed online during a code change gone awry, and in a few of these cases, people saw unauthorized transactions on their accounts.

All of these customers have been fully refunded, according to a PayPal spokesperson.

&quot;When there is a potential exposure of customer information, PayPal is required to notify affected customers,&quot; the spokesperson told The Register. &quot;In this case, PayPal&#39;s systems were not compromised. As such, we contacted the approximately 100 customers who were potentially impacted to provide awareness on this matter.&quot;

According to a February 10 data breach notification sent to affected customers and shared with The Register, the online payment company spotted the unauthorized activity on December 12. It was due to a coding error in its PayPal Working Capital loan application that inadvertently leaked customers&#39; business contact information - including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and business addresses - between July 1, 2025, and December 13, 2025.

&quot;PayPal has since rolled back the code change responsible for this error, which potentially exposed the PII,&quot; the letter said [PDF].

As soon as it noticed the leak and fraudulent transactions, PayPal says it began an investigation and blocked the unauthorized access, resetting passwords of affected accounts and requiring customers to set a new password the next time they log in.

&quot;A few customers experienced unauthorized transactions on their account and PayPal has issued refunds to these customers,&quot; according to the notification.

The company is also offering affected customers two years of free credit monitoring.

This data incident follows an earlier - and much worse - PayPal breach that also occurred in December, during which &quot;unauthorized parties&quot; accessed customers&#39; accounts using their valid login credentials.

In that 2022 security snafu, personal info belonging to 35,000 PayPal users was exposed including customers&#39; names, addresses, Social Security numbers, individual tax identification numbers, and dates of birth. ®

﻿EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910 bring more quirky weirdness to the company’s plugin suite.

Arturia launched a new version of its flagship effects suite, FX Collection, which includes two new plugins, EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910. FX Collection 6 also marks the introduction of an Intro version with a selection of six effects covering the basics for $99. That pales in comparison to the 39 effects in the full FX Collection Pro, but that also costs $499.

Pitch Shifter-910 is based on the iconic Eventide H910 Harmonizer from 1974, an early digital pitchshifter and delay with a very unique character. Arturia does an admirable job preserving its glitchy quirks. Pitch Shifter-910 is not a transparent effect that lets you create natural-sounding harmonies with yourself. Instead, it relishes in its weirdness, delivering chipmunk vocals at the higher ranges. There is also a more modern mode that cleans up some artifacts while preserving what makes the 910 so special. Though if you ask me, it also takes some of the fun and unpredictability out.

EFX Ambient is the other new addition to Arturia’s lineup, and it’s a weird one. While it does what it says on the tin, it doesn’t always do it in predictable ways. Sure, there’s plenty of big ethereal reverbs and shimmer, but there’s also resonators, glitch processing, and reverse delays. It has six distinct modes with unique characteristics, which it feeds through a big washy reverb. And there’s an X/Y control in the middle for adding movement to your sound.

Neither of the brand-new effects made the cut for the Intro version. FX Collection 6 Intro includes Efx Motions, Efx Fragments, Mix Drums, Tape Mello-Fi, Rev Plate-140, and Delay Tape-201. That offers excellent versatility covering delay, reverb, tape-like lo-fi, modulation, and even granular processing. Primarily, what you miss out on are some of the saturation and mixing effects like bus and compression, as well as the more specialty flavors of delay and reverb like Rev LX-24, based on the Lexicon 224 from 1978.

$499 for the full FX Collection 6 Pro might seem steep, but as the company has grown the lineup from 15 effects in 2020 to 39 in 2026, it’s become a more attractive value proposition. And, while it’s not quite as highly regarded as Arturia’s V Collection of soft synths, it’s building a reputation for high-quality effects.

The political action committee sent out partially pre-filled absentee ballot applications.﻿

For all his bluster about voter fraud, Elon Musk has been one of the most flagrant flaunters of US election law. Now his America PAC has been slapped with a reprimand by the Georgia State Election Board for sending out pre-filled absentee ballot applications. State law prohibits anyone, other than an authorized relative, from sending an absentee ballot application prefilled with the elector’s information.

Residents of Chattooga, Cherokee, Coweta, Floyd, and Whitfield counties reported receiving absentee ballot applications from America PAC, partially pre-filled. According to the State Election Board, the applications also failed to note that they were not actual ballots and were not provided by the government, as is required by law.

At the State Election Board meeting on February 18th, the panel quickly handed down the reprimand. America PAC did not appear to send a representative or submit a statement in defense of its actions.

This is just the latest example of Musk testing the limits of election law after he repeatedly suggested paying people to sign a petition and register to vote in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and other swing states. It’s also another incident in which those who claim to be most concerned about election integrity have been caught potentially violating the law.

The posts raised alarms, but OpenAI declined to alert law enforcement.

The suspect in the mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, Jesse Van Rootselaar, was raising alarms among employees at OpenAI months before the shooting took place. This past June, Jesse had conversations with ChatGPT involving descriptions of gun violence that triggered the chatbot’s automated review system. Several employees raised concerns that her posts could be a precursor to real-world violence and encouraged company leaders to contact the authorities, but they ultimately declined.

OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood told The Verge that, while the company considered referring the account to law enforcement, it was ultimately decided that it did not constitute an “imminent and credible risk” of harm to others. Wood said that a review of the logs did not indicate there was active or imminent planning of violence. The company banned Rootselaar’s account, but it does not appear to have taken any further precautionary action.

Wood said, “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy. We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”

On February 10th, nine people were killed and 27 injured, including Rootselaar, in the deadliest mass shooting in Canada since 2020. Rootselaar was found dead at the scene of the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, where most of the killings took place.

The decision not to alert law enforcement might look misguided in retrospect, but Wood said that OpenAI’s goal is to balance privacy with safety and avoid introducing unintended harm through overly broad use of law enforcement referrals.

Welcome to the weekend, folks! The Reviews and Guides team here at The Verge is gearing up for all things Unpacked, but Samsung isn’t the only one readying new phones. Google just announced the Pixel 10A, which, for you early adopters, is already up for preorder with a $100 gift card. Elsewhere in deal land, you’ll find steep discounts on mopping vacuums, slight discounts on Soundcore’s cheap ANC headphones, and a rare discount on a new PC controller with swiveling sticks.

We finally have a release date for the Pixel 10A: March 5th. What’s more, if you’re thinking about picking up Google’s latest phone, you can already preorder the base-model configuration at Amazon and Best Buy with 128GB of storage and a $100 gift card for $499. Alternatively, Amazon is offering it with a free pair of the Pixel Buds 2A, a fantastic set of recently released earbuds that typically retail for $130.

Despite being a pretty minimal update, Google’s forthcoming Android handset is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t adopt a lot of features from the flagship Pixel 10 series; however, last year’s Tensor G4 chip is still speedy enough for most tasks, satellite SOS is handy, and you get slightly faster wired and wireless charging. More importantly, it still comes with seven years of OS and security updates, which, personally, I’d take over Magic Cue, Pixel Screenshots, and other AI-based tools any day of the week.

Twelve. That’s how many AC outlets Anker’s 351 Power Strip — which is now available in black or white from Amazon and Anker for $23.99 ($6 off) — packs into its 9.65-inch, surge-protected build. The beefy power strip also features a 20W USB-C port and two USB-A ports, both of which can deliver up to 15W of juice. Just keep in mind that, like with most power strips and like-minded chargers, you’ll have to split power amongst the USB ports, which are limited to a max output of 15W when charging multiple devices simultaneously.

I’m admittedly not a huge fan of fighting games — I have no patience for learning combos, dear readers — but the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot seems like a good compromise if I were forced to choose between a traditional controller and one specifically built for hammering out hadokens. And now, the novel gamepad is on sale at both Amazon and Best Buy for $99.99 ($40 off), its lowest price to date.

Although Turtle Beach’s wireless PC controller offers a slew of welcome components, including drift-free Hall effect joysticks and adjustable trigger stops, its defining feature is a pair of rotating modules that can “pivot” to reveal a customizable controller layout that’s better suited for retro titles and fighting games. You also get programmable back buttons, the ability to save up to five profiles, and a 3.5mm audio jack, not to mention compatibility with mobile devices over Bluetooth and Xbox consoles via a wired connection.

If you’re looking for a cheap(ish) set of noise-canceling headphones, Soundcore’s Space One are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) in all four colors for $79.99 ($20 off), matching their second-best price to date.

During Cyber Monday last year, our own John Higgins waxed poetic about the over-ear cans, namely because they deliver impressive sound and comfort for the price. The sound quality and ANC don’t rival the flagships from Sony or Bose, sure, but you can try over 20 different presets or tweak the sound yourself using the eight-band equalizer in Anker’s companion app. They can also last up to 40 hours with ANC enabled, meaning you should be able to fly from New York to Singapore and back again without ever having to charge them.

            <div id="article-text">It might be better than the real thing. It’s safer, at least.

It might be better than the real thing. It’s safer, at least.

I’ve always wanted to go skydiving. Aerial_Knight’s DropShot, from indie developer Aerial_Knight, lets me live out that dream — at least in a safe, virtual kind of way. It also lets me shoot bullets from finger guns, wield laser skulls, and wear cool sunglasses while I’m falling through the air. So maybe it’s better than the real thing.

Playing as a character named Smoke Wallace, who was bitten by a dragon that gave him the finger gun that can actually shoot bullets, you plummet toward the ground and try to pick off bad guys with that finger gun or by punching them up close. It’s a first-person game, and the perspective really helps sell the feeling that you’re falling through the sky.

Your goal is to survive each level without taking more than two hits from the bad guys or other dangers like lasers, all while taking down as many enemies as you can as quickly as possible. Your gun has a limited number of bullets, but you can refill your ammo by shooting or flying into balloons you’ll see as you fall.

Each level is short. I finished most of them in 45 seconds to a minute and a half. At the end, you get a letter grade based on how many enemies you take down, maxing out at S+++ if you reach a certain per-level goal. Since the terrain, obstacles, enemies, and speed boosts spawn in the same spot each level, repeating them to try and get that high score turns each level into fast-paced FPS puzzles you can crack to find the optimal route.

The game oozes style. Smoke Wallace has purple skin because of his dragon bite. He wears sunglasses, and you can pick different styles that give you different power-ups for finding the eggs, like one that briefly lets you fire six finger guns at a time. Every time you kill a bad guy, the game briefly goes into slow-motion. You’ll even take on bosses that include dragons and flying tanks. And throughout, you’ll be treated to an awesome heavy metal soundtrack.

I was done with DropShot after about two-and-a-half hours, and I could spend more time grinding S+++ scores if I wanted to. But I think the short length works in the game’s favor: DropShot explores its core mechanics in 50 great levels instead of stretching everything out into something that might wear thin. Even when I was nearing the end, I was still excited every time I flew through the sky.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The parent company of Jeep and Dodge just took a $26.5 billion hit on its EV investment. But its problems run much deeper than that.

The parent company of Jeep and Dodge just took a $26.5 billion hit on its EV investment. But its problems run much deeper than that.

Demand for EVs has gone glacial, and one automaker after another is running aground: General Motors threw $7.6 billion overboard. Ford washed $19.5 billion off its books. Leave it to Stellantis to face the most titanic charge yet, a $26.5 billion bill for its own misplaced bet on EVs.

The Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler parent company hasn’t said how much of that unfathomable sum is explicitly due to EV losses, as the write-down wiped away about 25 percent of the company’s stock value overnight. Every automaker faces the same cooling EV demand and whipsawing political climate, yet Stellantis appears the most exposed, due in part to longstanding failures to keep up with evolving tech or consumer tastes. Don’t forget quality. An additional $16.7 billion charge for warranty and recall claims, including a recall of 320,000 Jeep 4xe plug-in hybrids for battery-fire risks, adds insult to financial injury.

The names may change — Stellantis, Fiat Chrysler, DaimlerChrysler, Chrysler Corp. — but the company stays frustratingly familiar. It’s the slightly off-key sister in the Motown trio. It’s an automaker enamored of the quick fix, the low-hanging fruit.

In America, that low-hanging fruit tends to come in bunches of eight, with Hemi V8s below the hood of a thirsty pickup, SUV, or muscle car. Now it’s déjà vu all over again. Stellantis plans to ship 100,000 Hemi engines from its Saltillo, Mexico, factory in 2026, tripling output to power Ram 1500 pickups, Jeep Wranglers, and other models. For now, the demand appears there, and executives intend to give the people what they want.

During an analysts’ call last year, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the so-called Big Beautiful Bill — making sure to give President Trump credit — allows the company “more flexibility in choosing… a mix between ICE and electric versions that we sell. And this will mean, to us, a lot of additional profit.”

It’s hard to blame automakers for wanting to make back these brutal EV losses. Like GM, Ford, or Toyota, Stellantis is forecasting a financial windfall from the Trump administration’s blank check on pollution and mileage rules. But the pendulum will inevitably swing, and if this automaker doesn’t invest in affordable passenger cars and tech, it’s going to get its head lopped off.

Certainly, Stellantis’ EVs weren’t getting it done in America. The hunky Dodge Charger Daytona was a valiant-but-failed attempt at updating Mopar muscle for an electric age. Dodge was forced to add a gasoline version. A half-baked Jeep Wagoneer S EV, at more than $70,000 with options, fell flat in showrooms. The 2026 Jeep Recon is the company’s next shot at luring Tesla Model Y buyers, though the Mexico-built SUV will also start from $67,000, and with no $7,500 consumer tax credit to soften the blow.

The names may change — Stellantis, Fiat Chrysler, DaimlerChrysler, Chrysler Corp. — but the company stays frustratingly familiar

Those models aren’t what the Trump administration has in mind to “assist” the industry, as it locks fuel-economy and emissions rules into a time machine, seemingly bound for the Eisenhower administration. A yearlong spree against regulations culminated with last week’s killing of the “endangerment finding,” the historic ruling that required the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and safety.

Automakers will no longer face fines for failing to meet tailpipe pollution or fuel-economy standards. They will no longer be required to buy pricey climate credits from the likes of Tesla, or spend billions developing EVs that weren’t boosting the bottom line.

In the face of such regulatory monkey business, the Detroit Three are naturally tempted to play see no evil, hear no evil. Automakers are free to make whatever cars they like, at least until the next sheriff rides into Washington. “Choice” is their new mantra. Unsurprisingly, their choice is to make hay and haul it in fossil-fueled SUVs and pickup trucks that generate virtually all its profits.

Washington insists this is all about making cars more affordable. That includes a vindictive axing of fuel-saving stop/start technology, which the EPA calculated was trimming owners’ gasoline bills between 7.3 and 26.4 percent. (Wait, doesn’t gasoline cost money?) And it’s precisely those feature-stuffed trucks and SUVs that drove the price of the average new car past $50,000 in the first place. Today’s cheap gasoline also encourages automakers to party now and pay later. Longer memories will recall the old Chrysler getting caught with its pants down whenever fuel prices spiked, its showrooms overflowing with unsold, guzzling trucks. Churlish types may even recall Chrysler’s 2009 bankruptcy and subsequent federal bailout.

Like its automaking peers, Stellantis insists it won’t walk away from EVs. But it remains more reliant on trucks and SUVs than any rival. Stellantis would at least try to own its area of expertise. Yet sales of its bread-and-butter Ram pickup, after briefly nosing past the mighty Ford F-150, have fallen off a cliff. Sure, some of that drop came from Ram’s controversial decision to drop a V-8 in favor of a more-efficient “Hurricane” inline V-6. But it’s more related to the botched rollout of a redesigned 2025 Ram, with production bottlenecks, quality glitches, and the elimination of an affordable “Classic” model in favor of moneymakers like the $87,000 Tungsten edition.

Try this for market malpractice: Prior to the launch of the 2026 Jeep Cherokee, a critical hybrid SUV that revives a storied Jeep nameplate, Stellantis didn’t even have a straight-up rival for the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, or other wildly popular compact SUVs. (The Jeep Compass is much smaller and not up for that fight).

“That’s really where the market is, and the Koreans and Japanese are all over those segments,” says Tom Libby, director of industry analysis for S&P Global Mobility.

Like its automaking peers, Stellantis insists it won’t walk away from EVs. But it remains more reliant on trucks and SUVs than any rival

Compact SUVs are one of 33 market segments, by S&P’s count, yet those models account for 21 percent of all US sales. Stellantis, in effect, “was only competing in four-fifths of the market,” Libby says.

A revolving door of management hasn’t helped. Filosa is the latest CEO following the abrupt resignation of Carlos Tavares in December 2024, with Tavares facing pressure from all sides. Dealers, suppliers, the UAW, key shareholders, and the managing board were in near-revolt over slumping sales and Tavares’ relentless cost-cutting. Like a perpetually rebuilding sports franchise, each new company chief arrives with high hopes and fresh strategies, then gets replaced before he or she can see it through.

“You can’t keep changing course and expect things to improve,” Libby says.

In Europe, Stellantis’ Peugeot and Citroen brands were doing solid EV sales. Now the EU is watering down an EV mandate for 2035. So Stellantis plans to resurrect diesel engines in at least seven European models. Some analysts see this as smart business, with Chinese automakers having no diesels to sell. But this is also Stellantis at its blast-from-the-past best. In Europe, diesels have fallen from more than half the market in 2015 to 7.7 percent today. EVs are at nearly 20 percent and rising fast, driven by the arrival of Chinese models from BYD and others.

Notoriously, Stellantis has too many underperforming brands, with 14 core outfits including a superfluous Lancia, Vauxhall, and DS in Europe. (I’ll leave Maserati off that list, hoping this once-glorious brand can survive). By this point, a boss-baby CEO would realize he has too many toys to play with. Yet each new chief has resisted making tough calls on which brands to cut loose. As brands such as Chrysler wither, executives publicly proclaim their love and commitment, only to neglect them.

Attempts to reestablish Fiat and Alfa Romeo in America were noble, especially for enthusiasts who crave some la dolce vita in their cars. But Alfa Romeo sold 5,600 cars here last year and a paltry 1,300 for Fiat. Sorry, but the experiment has failed. And despite having seven brands in America, none is the kind of mainstream anchor provided by GM’s Chevrolet, Ford, Toyota, or Honda.

Yet for all that, Stellantis doesn’t have a mainstream domestic car brand to take on Toyota, Honda, or Hyundai. It doesn’t have a high-margin luxury brand akin to Cadillac, whose thriving EV sales (prior to the kibosh on consumer credits) saw it pass a stumbling Audi in the US luxury ranks.

“You can’t keep changing course and expect things to improve.”

Things hit bottom in August, when Stellantis’ share of the US retail market reached a record-low 5.4-percent, according to S&P Global. The company has begun to turn things around, with retail share rising to 6.3 percent in November. But after shedding market share to Toyota or Honda for decades, the company is now losing it to Hyundai and Kia, whose sales have exploded. Not coincidentally, those Korean brands have invested in full lineups that encompass affordable sedans, SUVs, and smartly designed EVs.

One ominous number illustrates the depth of the problem. Stellantis’ percentage of repeat customers, which S&P calls its manufacturer loyalty measure, sunk to around 41 percent in August, before recovering to 47 percent for the fourth quarter. In other words, fewer than half of current owners are buying another Stellantis model, and that’s with seven brands to choose from. Among automakers that offer at least two brands here, only Volkswagen was lower at 44 percent.

At GM, a healthy 66 percent of owners end up buying another GM model, followed by Toyota and Ford at a respective 64 and 61 percent. That loyalty has become a critical indicator of long-term success, as a growing number of automakers fight over a limited (or shrinking) pie of new-car buyers. The winners are those who can steal customers from rivals, win over younger generations, and ideally keep them for life.

The frustrating part is that Stellantis, when it’s on its game, can deliver compelling cars and trucks, full of charm and personality.

The plush-and-powerful Ram. The Jeep Wrangler, which experienced a massive sales renaissance as Americans rediscovered the joys of authentic off-roaders. The Dodge Challenger and its Hellcat and Demon offshoots. The overlooked Maserati GranTurismo Folgore, a sweet-driving, 202-mph electric indulgence that makes a Lucid look like a Hertz rental.

Stellantis has little choice but to lean into its traditional customer base for now. But Stellantis must keep investing in electrification and other advanced tech, before the winds change again. Chinese EVs already have a foothold in Europe and a coming toehold in Canada and will inevitably blow into America as well.

The Ram 1500 REV pickup, serially delayed, remains an intriguing tech play. This type of “extended range electric vehicle,” or EREV, uses an ICE engine solely to generate electricity for a battery, which then efficiently powers the wheels. With much longer electric ranges than today’s plug-in hybrids, and the ability to fill a gas tank when needed, EREVs could prove popular with Americans who are leery over EV range or long charging times. Ram says the REV can cover 145 miles on plug-in electricity alone, with 690 miles of total range.

Filosa intends to revitalize a near-dormant Chrysler brand, including an actual sedan (possibly electric) based on the Halcyon concept, and perhaps a sporty small car priced below $30,000. The company is also readying a demo fleet of Charger Daytonas, powered by semi-solid-state batteries — from the Massachusetts-based Factorial Energy — that helped a lightly modified Mercedes EQS sedan cover 749 miles from Stuttgart to Sweden, with 85 miles of range to spare.

If Stellantis can get in on the ground floor of crazy-ranging, rapid-charging solid-state batteries, it and other homegrown automakers could leapfrog the best lithium-ion technology in all of China. Stellantis would be viewed as a tech leader, not a follower. Show them 500 miles of range and a 15-minute charge, and EV fans might consider a Dodge, Chrysler, or Ram for the first time in their lives. Don’t laugh. Remember how Tesla was going to drive every legacy automaker out of business? The clock may be ticking on Stellantis, but it’s not too late to change.

Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.

There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London.It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

            <div id="article-text">Twenty years ago, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr was having persistent pain in her breasts. Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares.

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

            <div id="article-text">The bird is a beautiful silver-gray, and as she dies twitching in the lasernet I’m grateful for two things: First, that she didn’t make a sound. Second, that this will be the very last time.

They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.

I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.

I switch the lasernet on the bird from electrocute to incinerate and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.

“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.

“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”

I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.

“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”

I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.

“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”

The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.

“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”

Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.

LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.

LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.

Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.

LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.

“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”

“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”

“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.

I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.

“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”

I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”

“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”

There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.

I notice she doesn’t say What if  I get what Jordan got? Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.

“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.

It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.

“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”

You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.

We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.

But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.

I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.

She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.

She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”

I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.

“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.

I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.

“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”

He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.

It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.

After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word Please.

When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.

The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”

I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. Stubborn. The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called resource-intensive. But I have been called a waste.

When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.

“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.

After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.

“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.

I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: Killing to Save!

She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.

Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”

I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.

“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”

It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.

Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”

The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”

I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.

I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial. I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.

Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.

I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.

The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.

I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.

I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.

I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.

By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.

I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.

I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.

I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.

Micaiah Johnson’s debut novel, The Space Between Worlds, a Sunday Times bestseller and New York Times Editors’ Choice pick, was named one of the best books of 2020 and one of the best science fiction books of the last decade by NPR. Her first horror novel, The Unhaunting, is due out in fall 2026.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/20/1133365/measles-cases-rising-vaccine-preventable-infections-mumps-hepatitis-b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed hospital treatment.

It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.

The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.

Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years, according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.

But vaccination rates have been lagging, says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”

Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters last month.

Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.

The UK is one of six countries to have lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada lost its elimination status last year.

The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”

Then there’s mumps—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)

Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.

“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.

Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs eliminated the virus’s spread.

Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.

Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).

“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”

All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health. But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.

“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”

            <h2>Microsoft has a new plan to prove what’s real and what’s AI online</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1133360/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-prove-whats-real-and-whats-ai-online/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A private premiere screening of “Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force,” the pilot installment of the planned Holiguards Saga franchise, was held on February 16 at ASTOR Film Lounge Berlin.

The event took place in a closed format with invited industry guests, partners, and media representatives. The screening was organized as a formal black-tie occasion and took place in Berlin during the same period as the Berlin International Film Festival, when international filmmakers, producers, distributors, and investors traditionally gather in the city.

“Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force” is an independently developed film project intended to launch a multi-installment franchise.

According to the producers, the project is structured as a long-term cinematic universe concept, with discussions currently underway regarding financing and production of subsequent chapters.

The film was directed by Kevin Spacey, who also portrays one of the central characters. This marks his first directorial work in approximately two decades. The ensemble cast includes Dolph Lundgren, Tyrese Gibson, Brianna Hildebrand, Disha Patani, Swen Temmel, Lado Okhotnikov, Harry Goodwins, and Sonia Pim Couling. Production was led by Elvira Paterson and Vadim Degtiarev.

Elledgy Media Group, under Paterson’s leadership, supported both the production coordination and the international promotion strategy for the project.

Set in the near future, “Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force” presents a fictional universe in which two ancient ideological orders, the Holiguards and the Statiguards, engage in a covert struggle over humanity’s direction.

The Holiguards advocate personal freedom and individual agency, while the Statiguards promote systemic order and centralized control. The central narrative follows Jessica, portrayed by Disha Patani, the daughter of leaders representing opposing factions. Positioned between conflicting legacies, her decisions influence the balance of power surrounding a mysterious cosmic energy source known as the Portal of Force.

The pilot installment introduces the mythological framework of the saga and establishes the political and philosophical tensions intended to expand in future chapters.

Ahead of the Berlin premiere, the production team reported receiving formal inquiries from international sales agents, distribution representatives, and private investors regarding potential collaboration and participation in future installments. Previous joint appearances by Elvira Paterson and Kevin Spacey were accompanied by private screenings and gala dinners in Cannes and Venice.

Following the Berlin premiere, a series of additional private screenings is planned in select international markets. Further announcements concerning festival participation, distribution strategy, and release scheduling will be made separately. At this stage, no official worldwide theatrical or streaming release date has been confirmed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A growing number of startups are rushing to build software that thinks fast. But one of the hardest parts of teaching machines to improve isn’t raw computing power, it’s human insight at scale.

Zurich-based startup Rapidata has just taken a significant step toward fixing that with a €7.2 million seed round aimed at scaling a global network for human feedback, the essential ingredient for aligning and refining AI models.

The round was disclosed today by EU-Startups, positioning Rapidata as an early player in what could become a major layer of AI infrastructure: a system that compresses feedback loops from humans into AI training systems from weeks or months down to hours or days.

Modern AI systems have become astonishingly capable at generating text and images, but they still struggle with nuance, judgement and context, the very aspects humans excel at.

That’s why many advanced models are trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where people judge outputs and rate responses to shape the model’s behaviour.

Rapidata claims to change that by tapping a continuously available, worldwide network of real people, enabling AI teams to gather large volumes of high-quality human judgments far more quickly and flexibly than before.

Founded in 2023, Rapidata sits at the intersection of crowd intelligence and advanced machine learning infrastructure.

Instead of static pools of annotators or traditional data labeling services, Rapidata’s platform gives teams on-demand access to human insight everywhere. That means feedback isn’t limited by geography or segmentation, it scales with demand.

Rapidata’s mission also highlights a broader trend in AI infrastructure: investors and developers alike are beginning to treat human judgment as a core part of the stack, not just an afterthought.

As models become more capable, contextual human insight determines whether those capabilities are useful, safe, and aligned with real-world expectations.

With fresh capital in hand, Rapidata plans to accelerate growth of its human feedback network, onboarding more participants worldwide and improving integration with AI development workflows.

The company believes that the next major scarcity in AI won’t be compute, it will be high-quality human signal, and it wants to build the platform to serve it.

For an industry still figuring out how to scale both intelligence and alignment, a real-time feedback network could be a key piece of the puzzle, and Rapidata is positioning itself as one of the early builders of that future.

            <h2>Gartner $110M sale of Digital Markets division in latest SEC filing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/gartner-110m-sale-of-digital-markets-division-in-latest-sec-filing">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Gartner first disclosed that it had agreed to part with its Digital Markets ( business unit that included its major software review, specifically Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice) business in early 2026, the announcement was forward-looking and economical with detail: it named the buyer and the assets involved, but it left out any financial terms.

That lack of financial detail naturally made people wonder exactly how much the transaction was worth.

It was only later, in the company’s audited annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, that a clearer picture of how the transaction was treated in the company’s regulatory filings became visible. That document, which is public, notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, placing the divestiture within the broader contours of Gartner’s financial disclosures.

This most recent filing, accession number 0000749251-26-000112, stands in stark contrast with Gartner’s prior 10-K, covering the year ended December 31, 2024, and filed on February 13, 2025, under accession 0000749251-25-000008.

In that earlier report, there is no reference to this transaction or to any figure associated with it, consistent with the fact that the deal was not agreed or closed until 2026.

The January 29, 2026 announcement publicly identified G2 as the buyer, and specified the assets involved: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, but it did not disclose any financial terms, a detail that was equally absent from contemporaneous coverage.

In Gartner’s 10-K, the recorded consideration is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” a phrase that signals the number reported in the filing is an initial headline value that may change once post-closing reconciliations tied to balance sheet items are completed.

These adjustments are common in sales agreements and are meant to align the agreed price with the business’s actual financial situation at closing.

A related 8-K filed on February 3, 2026, which included an earnings release, did not include any price details about the sale.

When we looked for the earliest relevant documents, we found that an earlier annual report,  Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2025 (accession 0000749251-25-000008), covers Gartner’s results through the end of 2024 and makes no reference to Digital Markets or the brands that were later sold.

That absence simply reflects the timing: the deal was agreed and completed in 2026, so it could not have been reported in a document covering the prior year.

Thus, the first SEC filing in which the transaction clearly appears is Gartner’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed on February 12, 2026, under accession 0000749251-26-000112.

It is in this later annual report that Gartner formally records the sale of the business and constitutes the first document in the public record to show how the company accounted for the transaction in its audited disclosures.

Reading the February 12, 2026, 10-K, the Digital Markets sale shows up in several sections. Early in the document, in the business overview, Gartner notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, alongside the headline figure that appears in the record.

Later in the same report, in a section discussing recent developments, the company lays out the context around the divestiture, reporting that Digital Markets was classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2025, and listing the related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

The same description of the sale is repeated once more in a note on subsequent events, which walks through the timeline from signing to closing.

Notably, none of these references in the annual report names the buyer. Within the text of the 10-K, a search reveals that “G2” and the individual brands that were part of the business being sold do not appear, underscoring that Gartner’s disclosure is focused on the transaction as a financial event rather than on the identity of the counterparty.

When a company states that a sale price is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” it means the number reported is only a starting point.

In most deals, the buyer and seller agree on an initial figure but include mechanisms in the contract that can revise that figure after closing to reflect the business’s actual financial position at transfer of control.

These post-closing adjustments are designed to ensure a fair final amount based on what the business truly delivered at closing, rather than on estimates made when the agreement was signed.

The most common of these adjustments is tied to working capital, the cash and short-term assets a business needs to operate. Parties negotiate a target level; if the actual working capital at closing is higher than expected, the seller may receive more. If it’s lower, the buyer may pay less.

Other adjustments can relate to net cash or debt, where the purchase price is recalculated based on the actual cash and debt assumed by the buyer, and to mechanisms such as escrows or deferred payments that hold portions of the sale price until certain conditions are resolved.

Because Gartner’s public filing does not include the underlying sale agreement or a detailed reconciliation of these adjustment mechanisms, the exact formulas or thresholds that could change the final amount are not visible in the public record.

What the 10-K does make clear is that the figure reported is a headline number, subject to later review and revision once the closing accounts are finalized.

In many deals, the headline price is agreed on a “cash-free, debt-free” basis, meaning that after closing, the buyer and seller adjust the purchase price to reflect the target business’s actual cash and debt position.

If the business ends up with more debt or less cash than expected, the effective price the seller receives can be reduced. Conversely, if it has more cash or less debt than anticipated, it can increase the amount paid.

In Gartner’s public disclosures, there is no way to tell from the 10-K whether the Digital Markets sale was structured this way or how any such adjustment would be calculated because the underlying agreement and detailed terms are not part of the filings.

What the 10-K does show is the initial figure; whether and how it changes through these common adjustment mechanisms remains outside the public record.

Gartner’s most recent Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, shows that the company completed the sale of its Digital Markets business on February 5, 2026, using language that describes the consideration as “approximately $110.0 million, before customary purchase price adjustments.” This is the only financial figure tied to the deal that appears in the public filings.

The earlier public announcement from January 29, in which G2 said it had agreed to buy Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp from Gartner, did not include any financial terms, and subsequent media coverage similarly reported that price details were not disclosed at the time.

In filings, the phrase “purchase price adjustments” refers to standard mechanisms in sale agreements, often tied to working capital and other balance-sheet items, that can increase or decrease the final amount paid after closing.

Gartner’s 10-K does not name the buyer in the sale disclosure, but it confirms the closing date and the approximate consideration while noting that the figure could change through those adjustments.

Taken together, Gartner’s own regulatory filings tell a more complete story of the Digital Markets sale than the initial announcement did. The only financial detail available in the public record comes from the company’s 10-K, which notes the closing date and describes the consideration in broad terms, but it leaves several questions unanswered.

We also reached out to both sides for further comment and clarification ahead of publication, seeking confirmation of the figures, insight into the structure of the deal, and any context that might illuminate how the transaction was negotiated and reported.

By the time of publication, neither party had responded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Video: Gemini Lyria Music Generation Feature – Socks, uploaded by Google on YouTube

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.
