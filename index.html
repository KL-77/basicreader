            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/theres-a-rash-of-scam-spam-coming-from-a-real-microsoft-address/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are reports that a legitimate Microsoft email address—which Microsoft explicitly says customers should add to their allow list—is delivering scam spam.

The emails originate from no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, an address tied to Power BI. The Microsoft platform provides analytics and business intelligence from various sources that can be integrated into a single dashboard. Microsoft documentation says that the address is used to send subscription emails to mail-enabled security groups. To prevent spam filters from blocking the address, the company advises users to add it to allow lists.

According to an Ars reader, the address on Tuesday sent her an email claiming (falsely) that a $399 charge had been made to her. It provided a phone number to call to dispute the transaction. A man who answered a call asking to cancel the sale directed me to download and install a remote access application, presumably so he could then take control of my Mac or Windows machine (Linux wasn’t allowed). The email, captured in the two screenshots below, looked like this:

Online searches returned a dozen or so accounts of other people reporting receiving the same email. Some of the spam was reported on Microsoft’s own website.

Sarah Sabotka, a threat researcher at security firm Proofpoint, said the scammers are abusing a Power Bi function that allows external email addresses to be added as subscribers for the Power Bi reports. The mention of the subscription is buried at the very bottom of the message, where it’s easy to miss. The researcher explained:

The abuse of a legitimate service, like Microsoft Power BI, adds an additional layer of credibility to the social engineering. The actual scam occurs during the voice interaction, which helps attackers evade traditional email-based detection and security controls. Further, attackers gain two advantages at once: the email is sent from a trusted Microsoft domain, and the lack of malicious links or attachments reduces the likelihood of automated filtering. While the emails originate from Microsoft infrastructure, the content and intent are fully controlled by the attacker via misuse of a legitimate feature.

Scammers have abused Microsoft Power Bi functionality in the past. Security firm Cofense reported in September that it found a spam campaign that transmitted phishing links that were hosted on the platform. Companies besides Microsoft that have experienced similar abuse include Google, according to Check Point. The security firm found a run of nearly 9,400 emails that were sent through the Google Cloud Application Integration platform.

A key detail that’s currently unknown is: Do users have to explicitly opt in to receiving emails from email addresses like no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, and can scammers send them to any external address automatically? A Microsoft representative said he’s looking into reports and didn’t have information immediately available. For more experienced Internet users, scams like this one are easy to spot. For others, scams that originate from a known sender with a clean reputation are more believable.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/supreme-court-to-decide-how-1988-videotape-privacy-law-applies-to-online-video/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Supreme Court is taking up a case on whether Paramount violated the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) by disclosing a user’s viewing history to Facebook. The case, Michael Salazar v. Paramount Global, hinges on the law’s definition of the word “consumer.”

Salazar filed a class action against Paramount in 2022, alleging that it “violated the VPPA by disclosing his personally identifiable information to Facebook without consent,” Salazar’s petition to the Supreme Court said. Salazar had signed up for an online newsletter through 247Sports.com, a site owned by Paramount, and had to provide his email address in the process. Salazar then used 247Sports.com to view videos while logged in to his Facebook account.

“As a result, Paramount disclosed his personally identifiable information—including his Facebook ID and which videos he watched—to Facebook,” the petition said. “The disclosures occurred automatically because of the Facebook Pixel Paramount installed on its website. Facebook and Paramount then used this information to create and display targeted advertising, which increased their revenues.”

The 1988 law defines consumer as “any renter, purchaser, or subscriber of goods or services from a video tape service provider.” The phrase “video tape service provider” is defined to include providers of “prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials,” and thus arguably applies to more than just sellers of tapes.

The legal question for the Supreme Court “is whether the phrase ‘goods or services from a video tape service provider,’ as used in the VPPA’s definition of ‘consumer,’ refers to all of a video tape service provider’s goods or services or only to its audiovisual goods or services,” Salazar’s petition said. The Supreme Court granted his petition to hear the case in a list of orders released yesterday.

The Facebook Pixel at the center of the lawsuit is now called the Meta Pixel. The Pixel is a piece of JavaScript code that can be added to a website to track visitors’ activity “and optimize your advertising performance,” as Meta describes it.

Salazar lost his case at a federal court in Nashville, Tennessee, and then lost an appeal at the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. (247Sports has its corporate address in Tennessee.) A three-judge panel of appeals court judges ruled 2–1 to uphold the district court ruling. The appeals court majority said:

The Video Privacy Protection Act—as the name suggests—arose out of a desire to protect personal privacy in the records of the rental, purchase, or delivery of “audio visual materials.” Spurred by the publication of Judge Robert Bork’s video rental history on the eve of his confirmation hearings, Congress imposed stiff penalties on any “video tape service provider” who discloses personal information that identifies one of their “consumers” as having requested specific “audio visual materials.”

This case is about what “goods or services” a person must rent, purchase, or subscribe to in order to qualify as a “consumer” under the Act. Is “goods or services” limited to audio-visual content—or does it extend to any and all products or services that a store could provide? Michael Salazar claims that his subscription to a 247Sports e-newsletter qualifies him as a “consumer.” But since he did not subscribe to “audio visual materials,” the district court held that he was not a “consumer” and dismissed the complaint. We agree and so AFFIRM.

Salazar’s petition to the Supreme Court alleged that the 6th Circuit ruling “imposes a limitation that appears nowhere in the relevant statutory text.” The 6th Circuit analysis “flout[s] the ordinary meaning of ‘goods or services,’” and “ignores that the VPPA broadly prohibits a video tape service provider—like Paramount here—from knowingly disclosing ‘personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider,’” he told the Supreme Court.

The DC Circuit ruled the same way as the 6th Circuit in another case last year, but other appeals courts have ruled differently. The 7th Circuit held last year that “any purchase or subscription from a ‘video tape service provider’ satisfies the definition of ‘consumer,’ even if the thing purchased is clothing or the thing subscribed to is a newsletter.”

In Salazar v. National Basketball Association, which also involves Michael Salazar, the 2nd Circuit ruled in 2024 that Salazar was a consumer under the VPPA because the law’s “text, structure, and purpose compel the conclusion that that phrase is not limited to audiovisual ‘goods or services,’ and the NBA’s online newsletter falls within the plain meaning of that phrase.” The NBA petitioned the Supreme Court for review in hopes of overturning the 2nd Circuit ruling, but the petition to hear the case was denied in December.

Despite the NBA case being rejected by the high court, a circuit split can make a case ripe for Supreme Court review. “Put simply, the circuit courts have divided 2–2 over how to interpret the statutory phrase ‘goods or services from a video tape service provider,’” Salazar told the court. “As a result, there is a 2–2 circuit split concerning what it takes to become a ‘consumer’ under the VPPA.”

While Salazar sued both Paramount and the NBA, he said the Paramount case “is a superior vehicle for resolving this exceptionally important question.” The case against the NBA is still under appeal on a different legal issue and “has had multiple amended pleadings since the lower courts decided the question, meaning the Court could not answer the question based on the now-operative allegations,” his petition said. By contrast, the Paramount case has a final judgment, no ongoing proceedings, and “can be reviewed on the same record the lower courts considered.”

Paramount urged the court to decline Salazar’s petition. Despite the circuit split on the “consumer” question, Paramount said that Salazar’s claims would fail in the 2nd and 7th circuits for different reasons. Paramount argued that “computer code shared in targeted advertising does not qualify as ‘personally identifiable information,’” and that “247Sports is not a ‘video tape service provider’ in the first place.”

“247Sports does not rent, sell, or offer subscriptions to video tapes. Nor does it stream movies or shows,” Paramount said. “Rather, it is a sports news website with articles, photos, and video clips—and all of the content at issue in this case is available for free to anybody on the Internet. That is a completely different business from renting video cassette tapes. The VPPA does not address it.”

Paramount further argued that Salazar’s case isn’t a good vehicle to consider the “consumer” definition because his “complaint fails for multiple additional reasons that could complicate further review.”

Paramount wasn’t able to convince the Supreme Court that the case isn’t worth taking up, however. SCOTUSblog says that “the case will likely be scheduled for oral argument in the court’s 2026-27 term,” which begins in October 2026.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/one-of-nasas-three-wb-57-aircraft-just-did-a-belly-landing-in-houston/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of NASA’s three large WB-57 aircraft made an emergency landing at Ellington Field on Tuesday morning in southeastern Houston.

Video captured by KHOU 11 television showed the aircraft touching down on the runway without its landing gear extended. The pilot then maintains control of the vehicle as it slides down the runway, slowing the aircraft through friction. The crew was not harmed, NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens said.

“Today, a mechanical issue with one of NASA’s WB-57s resulted in a gear-up landing at Ellington Field,” she said. “Response to the incident is ongoing, and all crew are safe at this time. As with any incident, a thorough investigation will be conducted by NASA into the cause. NASA will transparently update the public as we gather more information.”

The B-57 line of aircraft dates back to 1944, when the English Electric Company began developing the plane. After the Royal Air Force showcased the B-57 in 1951 by crossing the Atlantic in a record four hours and 40 minutes and becoming the first jet-powered aircraft to span the Atlantic without refueling, the United States Air Force began buying them to replace its aging Douglas B-26 Invader.

The aircraft performed bombing missions in Vietnam and other military campaigns, and a variant that later became the WB-57 was designed with longer wings that could fly even higher, up to 62,000 feet. This proved useful for weather reconnaissance and, around the world, to sample the upper atmosphere for evidence of nuclear debris where US officials suspected the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.

Although their utility for military purposes has faded, NASA has flown WB-57s as part of a broad-ranging science mission since 1972. The aircraft have flown above hurricanes, and missions as varied as collecting cosmic dust samples from comets and asteroids in Earth’s upper atmosphere, investigating clouds, and studying the environmental effect of plumes from the Titan, Space Shuttle, Delta, Atlas, and Athena rockets on the stratosphere. More recently, they have been used to observe launches of SpaceX’s Starship rocket and were due to be used in a similar manner for the Artemis II lunar mission.

After acquiring two of the aircraft earlier, NASA found a third one in the “boneyard” at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona in 2013. After this one was restored, the space agency flew all three simultaneously in 2015, an event attended by Ars.

It was not immediately clear whether the damage to the WB-57 on Tuesday was repairable, nor what impact this might have on plans to observe the launch of the Artemis II mission and reentry of the Orion spacecraft after its journey around the Moon.</div>

            <h2>LG's new subscription program charges up to £277 per month to rent a TV</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lgs-new-subscription-program-charges-up-to-277-per-month-to-rent-a-tv/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">LG has launched a subscription program in the UK that allows people to make monthly payments in order to rent LG TVs, soundbars, monitors, and speakers.

LG Flex customers can sign up for one-, two-, or three-year subscriptions to get lower monthly payments.

“At the end of your subscription, you can apply for a free upgrade, keep paying monthly, or return your device,” the LG Flex website says. Subscribers will have to pay a £50 (about $69) fee for a “full removal service,” including dismounting and packaging, of rental TVs.

LG also claims on its website that it won’t penalize customers for “obvious signs of use, such as some scratching, small dents, or changes in the paintwork.” However, if you damage the rental device, LG “may charge you for the cost of repair as outlined by the Repair Charges set out in your agreement.” LG’s subscription partner, Raylo, also sells insurance for coverage against “accidental damage, loss, and theft” of rented devices.

As of this writing, you can buy LG’s 83-inch OLED B5 2025 TV on LG’s UK website for £2,550 (about $3,515). Monthly rental prices range from £93 ($128), if you commit to a three-year-long rental period, to £277 ($382), if you only commit to a one-month rental period. Under the three-year plan, you can rent the TV for 27 months before you end up paying more to rent the TV than you would have to own it. At the highest rate, your rental payments will surpass MSRP after nine months.

The cheapest item available through LG Flex as of this writing is LG’s 3.1.1 channel soundbar with Dolby Atmos from 2024. You can buy it from LG’s UK website for £600 ($827) or rent it for £22 ($30) to £76 ($105) per month.

LG Flex can grant people instant access to electronics they may not be able to pay for currently. There are other options, like interest-free payment programs (which LG also offers), but those programs can require larger monthly payments than rentals do.

Still, renting gadgets from LG won’t make financial sense for many. The program can be handy for people, businesses, and other entities that require high-end gadgets for a limited amount of time or that want frequent upgrades. But renting electronics quickly becomes more costly than buying something. It’s often more prudent to save money that would have been used for monthly payments and instead invest it in something that you can own and maintain for years.

LG’s rental gadgets are only available in the UK. Ars Technica reached out to LG about whether it has plans to rent electronics in the US and will update this article if we hear back. As it stands, the program adds to the growing number of tech companies encouraging people to rent, instead of buy, their products. HP, for instance, has a printer rental program, and NZXT launched a gaming desktop rental program in 2024. Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber has also floated the idea of a subscription-based mouse.

LG Flex is just one example of how the South Korea-headquartered company is finding creative ways to build recurring revenue instead of relying solely on sales of its expensive gadgets, as such purchases occur sparingly and less predictably. Last year, LG launched a similar rental program for home appliances in Singapore and Malaysia.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and death. These can be the consequences for vulnerable kids who get addicted to social media, according to more than 1,000 personal injury lawsuits that seek to punish Meta and other platforms for allegedly prioritizing profits while downplaying child safety risks for years.

Social media companies have faced scrutiny before, with congressional hearings forcing CEOs to apologize, but until now, they’ve never had to convince a jury that they aren’t liable for harming kids.

This week, the first high-profile lawsuit—considered a “bellwether” case that could set meaningful precedent in the hundreds of other complaints—goes to trial. That lawsuit documents the case of a 19-year-old, K.G.M, who hopes the jury will agree that Meta and YouTube caused psychological harm by designing features like infinite scroll and autoplay to push her down a path that she alleged triggered depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicidality.

TikTok and Snapchat were also targeted by the lawsuit, but both have settled. The Snapchat settlement came last week, while TikTok settled on Tuesday just hours before the trial started, Bloomberg reported.

For now, YouTube and Meta remain in the fight. K.G.M. allegedly started watching YouTube when she was 6 years old and joined Instagram by age 11. She’s fighting to claim untold damages—including potentially punitive damages—to help her family recoup losses from her pain and suffering and to punish social media companies and deter them from promoting harmful features to kids. She also wants the court to require prominent safety warnings on platforms to help parents be aware of the risks.

A loss could cost social media companies billions, CNN reported.

To avoid that, platforms have alleged that other factors caused K.G.M.’s psychological harm—like school bullies and family troubles—while insisting that Section 230 and the First Amendment protect platforms from being blamed for any harmful content targeted to K.G.M.

They also argued that K.G.M.’s mom never read the terms of service and, therefore, supposedly would not have benefited from posted warnings. And ByteDance, before settling, seemingly tried to pass the buck by claiming that K.G.M. “already suffered mental health harms before she began using TikTok.”

But the judge, Carolyn B. Kuhl, wrote in a ruling denying all platforms’ motions for summary judgment that K.G.M. showed enough evidence that her claims don’t stem from content to go to trial.

Further, platforms can’t liken warnings buried in terms of service to prominently displayed warnings, Kuhl said, since K.G.M.’s mom testified she would have restricted the minor’s app usage if she were aware of the alleged risks.

Two platforms settling before the trial seems like a good sign for K.G.M. However, Snapchat has not settled other social media addiction lawsuits that it’s involved in, including one raised by school districts, and perhaps is waiting to see how K.G.M.’s case shakes out before taking further action.

To win, K.G.M.’s lawyers will need to “parcel out” how much harm is attributed to each platform, due to design features, not the content that was targeted to K.G.M., Clay Calvert, a technology policy expert and senior fellow at a think tank called the American Enterprise Institute, wrote. Internet law expert Eric Goldman told The Washington Post that detailing those harms will likely be K.G.M.’s biggest struggle, since social media addiction has yet to be legally recognized, and tracing who caused what harms may not be straightforward.

However, Matthew Bergman, founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center and one of K.G.M.’s lawyers, told the Post that K.G.M. is prepared to put up this fight.

“She is going to be able to explain in a very real sense what social media did to her over the course of her life and how in so many ways it robbed her of her childhood and her adolescence,” Bergman said.

The research is unclear on whether social media is harmful for kids or whether social media addiction exists, Tamar Mendelson, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told the Post. And so far, research only shows a correlation between Internet use and mental health, Mendelson noted, which could doom K.G.M.’s case and others’.

However, social media companies’ internal research might concern a jury, Bergman told the Post. On Monday, the Tech Oversight Project, a nonprofit working to rein in Big Tech, published a report analyzing recently unsealed documents in K.G.M.’s case that supposedly provide “smoking-gun evidence” that platforms “purposefully designed their social media products to addict children and teens with no regard for known harms to their wellbeing&quot;—while putting increased engagement from young users at the center of their business models.

In the report, Sacha Haworth, executive director of The Tech Oversight Project, accused social media companies of “gaslighting and lying to the public for years.”

Most of the recently unsealed documents highlighted in the report came from Meta, which also faces a trial from dozens of state attorneys general on social media addiction this year.

Those documents included an email stating that Mark Zuckerberg—who is expected to testify at K.G.M.’s trial—decided that Meta’s top priority in 2017 was teens who must be locked in to using the company’s family of apps.

The next year, a Facebook internal document showed that the company pondered letting “tweens” access a private mode inspired by the popularity of fake Instagram accounts teens know as “finstas.” That document included an “internal discussion on how to counter the narrative that Facebook is bad for youth and admission that internal data shows that Facebook use is correlated with lower well-being (although it says the effect reverses longitudinally).”

Other allegedly damning documents showed Meta seemingly bragging that “teens can’t switch off from Instagram even if they want to” and an employee declaring, “oh my gosh yall IG is a drug,” likening all social media platforms to “pushers.”

Similarly, a 2020 Google document detailed the company’s plan to keep kids engaged “for life,” despite internal research showing young YouTube users were more likely to “disproportionately” suffer from “habitual heavy use, late night use, and unintentional use” deteriorating their “digital well-being.”

Shorts, YouTube’s feature that rivals TikTok, also is a concern for parents suing, and three years later, documents showed Google choosing to target teens with Shorts, despite research flagging that the “two biggest challenges for teen wellbeing on YouTube” were prominently linked to watching shorts. Those challenges included Shorts bombarding teens with “low quality content recommendations that can convey & normalize unhealthy beliefs or behaviors” and teens reporting that “prolonged unintentional use” was “displacing valuable activities like time with friends or sleep.”

Bergman told the Post that these documents will help the jury decide if companies owed young users better protections sooner but prioritized profits while pushing off interventions that platforms have more recently introduced amid mounting backlash.

“Internal documents that have been held establishing the willful misconduct of these companies are going to—for the first time—be given a public airing,” Bergman said. “The public is going to know for the first time what social media companies have done to prioritize their profits over the safety of our kids.”

One seeming advantage K.G.M. has heading into the trial is that tech companies failed to get expert testimony dismissed that backs up her claims.

Platforms tried to exclude testimony from several experts, including Kara Bagot, a board-certified adult, child, and adolescent psychiatrist, as well as Arturo Bejar, a former Meta safety researcher and whistleblower. They claimed that experts’ opinions were irrelevant because they were based on K.G.M.’s interactions with content. They also suggested that child safety experts’ opinions “violate the standards of reliability” since the causal links they draw don’t account for “alternative explanations” and allegedly “contradict the experts’ own statements in non-litigation contexts.”

However, Kuhl ruled that platforms will have the opportunity to counter experts’ opinions at trial, while reminding social media companies that “ultimately, the critical question of causation is one that must be determined by the jury.” Only one expert’s testimony was excluded, Social Media Victims Law Center noted, a licensed clinical psychologist deemed unqualified.

“Testimony by Bagot as to design features that were employed on TikTok as well as on other social media platforms is directly relevant to the question of whether those design features cause the type of harms allegedly suffered by K.G.M. here,” Kuhl wrote.

That means that a jury will get a chance to weigh Bagot’s opinion that “social media overuse and addiction causes or plays a substantial role in causing or exacerbating psychopathological harms in children and youth, including depression, anxiety and eating disorders, as well as internalizing and externalizing psychopathological symptoms.”

The jury will also consider the insights and information Bejar (a fact witness and former consultant for the company) will share about Meta’s internal safety studies. That includes hearing about “his personal knowledge and experience related to how design defects on Meta’s platforms can cause harm to minors (e.g., age verification, reporting processes, beauty filters, public like counts, infinite scroll, default settings, private messages, reels, ephemeral content, and connecting children with adult strangers),” as well as “harms associated with Meta’s platforms including addiction/problematic use, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, suicidality, self-harm, and sexualization.”

If K.G.M. can convince the jury that she was not harmed by platforms’ failure to remove content but by companies “designing their platforms to addict kids” and “developing algorithms that show kids not what they want to see but what they cannot look away from,” Bergman thinks her case could become a “data point” for “settling similar cases en masse,” he told Barrons.

“She is very typical of so many children in the United States—the harms that they’ve sustained and the way their lives have been altered by the deliberate design decisions of the social media companies,” Bergman told the Post.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Large swathes of the US were blanketed in snow and ice over the weekend, and what better way to spend a snow day than going down a YouTube rabbit hole? Everyone has their favorite oddity: ASMR, jazzy pop song covers, cooking channels, or what have you. But DIY enthusiasts in particular are missing out if they’re not watching Drain Cleaning Australia, featuring an Australian plumber known only as Bruce as he goes about his daily business of shooting high-powered water jets into stubborn clogged drainage systems. It’s “the YouTube channel you never knew you needed.” And it’s done so well that he’s now launched a second channel, Bruce the Plumber.

I stumbled upon the Drain Cleaning Australia channel via Amy Poehler‘s Good Hang podcast episode with Kate McKinnon, who is a big fan and does a dead-on delivery of Bruce’s trademark lines (“You little rippah!”). Bruce never appears in his videos, apart from his hands and the occasional shadow as he films various challenging jobs with his intrepid smartphone. He seems to have struck a good balance between online popularity and protecting his personal privacy. (Bruce did not respond to our interview request. It’s okay, mate, we know all those drains Down Under aren’t going to unclog themselves.)

Armed with his trusty collection of jet nozzles and “Mister Plungey,” Bruce has removed all manner of nasty things from drains over the years: masses of human hair from shower drains; tree roots; plastic bags and other refuse that somehow found their way into drainage systems; and the less said about the many clogged toilets, the better.

My personal favorites are when Bruce takes on clogged restaurant grease traps, including the one at the top of this article in which he pulls out a massive greaseberg “the size of a chihuahua.” When it’s Bruce versus a nasty grease trap, the man remains undefeated (well, almost—sometimes he needs to get a grease trap pumped out before he can fix the problem). And I have learned more than I probably ever needed to know about how grease traps work.

Each video is its own little adventure. Bruce arrives on a job, checks out the problem (“she is chock-a-block, mate!”), and starts methodically working that problem until he solves it, which inevitably involves firing up “the bloody jet” to blast through blockages with 5,000 psi of water pressure (“Go, you good thing!”). This being Australia, he’ll occasionally encounter not just cockroaches but poisonous spiders and snakes. And he’s caught so many facefulls of wastewater and sewage while jetting that he really ought to invest in a hazmat suit. Even the cheesy canned techno-music playing during lulls in the action is low-budget perfection.

Bruce isn’t the only plumber with a YouTube channel—it’s a surprisingly good-size subgenre—but he’s the most colorful and entertaining. His unbridled enthusiasm for what many would consider the dirtiest of jobs is positively infectious. He regularly effuses about having the best job in the world, insisting that unclogging gross drains is “living the dream,” and regularly asks his audience, “How good is this? I mean, where else would you rather be?” Sure, he says it with an ironic (unseen) wink at the camera, but deep down, you know he truly loves the work.

And you know what? Bruce is right. It might not be your definition of “what dreams are made of,” but there really is something profoundly satisfying about a free-flowing drain—and a job well done.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You do not, under any circumstances, gotta to “hand it” to Palantir, a company known for its AI surveillance and battlefield tech, and whose CEO Alex Karp has mused about legalizing war crimes.

But you have to admit, it’s pretty striking to hear that even some of the company’s own employees are starting to feel disgusted about ICE amid its brutal crackdown in Minneapolis, according to new reporting from Wired.

After federal agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, some Palantir employees began openly questioning the work the company was doing with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and Border Patrol, the immigration authorities deployed in Minneapolis and other American cities.

“In my opinion ICE are the bad guys. I am not proud that the company I enjoy so much working for is part of this,” one worker wrote in Slack thread  about Pretti’s killing. “Thinking pragmatically: is the reputational damage we’re taking for being associated with them worth it? What if the next administration will be democratic and they cut all the contracts with us?”

“We need an understanding of our involvement here,” another demanded.

The protests were raised in a company-wide Slack channel dedicated to discussing news items. And many of the posts that were either critical of ICE or questioned Palantir’s involvement with the agency received dozens of upvotes in the form of “+1” emojis, according to Wired, underscoring how the sentiment was far from being fringe, and that the unrest was out in the open. Some employees even wondered if Palantir could help put an end to what they were reading about in the news.

“Can Palantir put any pressure on ICE at all?” one employee wrote. “I’ve read stories of folks rounded up who were seeking asylum with no order to leave the country, no criminal record, and consistently check in with authorities. Literally no reason to be rounded up. Surely we aren’t helping do that?”

Palantir and ICE have deep ties. A 404 Media scoop from earlier this month, for example, described how Palantir was secretly providing ICE a tracking tool called “ELITE” to scour Medicaid data and other government sources to create a map of people it could potentially deport, generating a dossier for each person that included where they live. Palantir was also awarded a $30 million contract to build ICE an “ImmigrationOS” to provide “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the country, and also worked on updating the agency’s database so it could “complete target analysis of known populations.”

But according to Wired, Palantir has been so internally secretive about its work with ICE over the last year that employees have been relying on news reports to find out about the services their employer provides the agency.

Now, the groundswell of unrest within Palantir’s ranks has seemingly reached a point where it can’t be ignored by leadership. In response to the Slack protests, Palantir’s civil liberties team updated its internal wiki with a breakdown on its work with ICE, arguing that the “technology is making a difference in mitigating risks while enabling targeted outcomes,” per Wired.

Strikingly, the wiki acknowledged the widespread reports of ICE racially profiling and deporting citizens, as well as the “reputational risk” it was undertaking by continuing to work with the agency. But it insisted ICE remains “committed to avoiding the unlawful/unnecessary targeting, apprehension, and detention of US citizens wherever and however possible.”

This wasn’t enough to appease the concerned employees. They continued to grill their higher-ups about whether ICE could use Palantir’s tools for purposes not agreed in the company’s contracts, leading one executive to admit that Palantir doesn’t “take the position of policing the use of our platform for every workflow,” and hand-waved aside concerns of its tech being abused because there would always be “bad apples.”

One employee also confronted the same executive about a video of an ICE agent scanning an onlooker’s car and telling them they’ve been added to a “database” that marks them as a “domestic terrorist.” The employee demanded to know if Palantir was behind the database, which the executive denied.

The unrest at Palantir is the latest example of how the outrage over ICE’s actions in Minneapolis is crossing political lines, with even some DHS and immigration agents appalled over what’s happening in the city, journalist Ken Klippenstein reports. One ICE agent was exasperated how ten agents “couldn’t find a way to subdue” Pretti without lethal force, and mocked how it would be framed as a “justified killing.” “The best they can do is shoot the guy in the back?” he fumed.

A senior ICE officer also had some thoughts about Pretti’s death. “F*ck this,” he told the journalist.

            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration may govern for the billionaire class, but that doesn’t necessarily mean billionaires are enjoying the show. Far more likely is that they don’t have the guts to speak up.

Case in point: late on Saturday night, a group of American tech magnates descended on the White House for a private screening of the first lady’s documentary, “Melania.“

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the intimate gathering included a veritable who’s who of tech industry power players: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Zoom CEO Eric Yuan.

Vibes-wise, the event was classic Trump 2.0-chic. Guests were handed monogrammed buckets of popcorn, framed screening tickets for their trophy shelves, and a limited-edition copy of Trump’s 2024 book of the same title as her documentary, “Melania.“ Prior to the screening, the black-tie guests were greeted by a taxpayer-funded military band that playing famous movie themes, as well as “Melania’s Waltz,” featured in the documentary and composed by Hollywood’s Tony Neiman.

All of this is to say, it sounds like a galling display of power and fortune, at a time when American wealth inequality is the worst its been in nearly a century. And in a twist of context so extraordinary that it sounds fictional, the screening also came just a few hours after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who was attempting to help a woman off of the ground during an immigration raid in Minneapolis.

Yet for all their reach and access — literally — to the president’s palace, tech executives have been oddly reserved after leaving the screening, both in regard to the film as well as the shooting, whose victim Trump smeared as a “domestic terrorist.” Attempts to reach these powerful tech moguls since Saturday have all been ignored, CNN notes.

Maybe they were so overwhelmed by the artistry of the film — the production of which was plagued by extraordinary drama documented by Rolling Stone — that they’re literally speechless.

Far more likely: the documentary, which is already gearing up to be a massive flop, is such a train wreck that they fear that publicly pretending it was any good will subject them to public ridicule. And that’s not to mention the fierce backlash that following the decision to carry on with the screening after Pretti’s death, which tech execs won’t be in any hurry to call attention to.

And in the long-term, for CEOs who paid for front-row seats to this administration, speaking out against the Trump administration now would mean putting ethics ahead of earnings — a calculation nobody in their position would ever make.

            <div id="article-text">The Department of Defense might be the first government agency to roll out a department-wide AI chatbot, but the Department of Transportation is about to be the first to draft actual binding regulations with the tech.

According to a new investigation by ProPublica, the top transportation agency has tapped Google Gemini to help write new regulations affecting aviation, automotive, railroad, and maritime safety. In internal communications from DoT attorney Daniel Cohen, agency staffers were presented with the plan along with a demonstration of AI’s “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings.”

The AI demonstration, Cohen enthused, would show off “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”

His focus, disturbingly, was explicitly that AI is fast, even if it isn’t particularly accurate.

“We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ,” DoT general counsel Gregory Zerzan said, according to the recent meeting notes obtained by ProPublica. “We want good enough,” he said. “We’re flooding the zone.”

In addition, Zerzan noted that enthusiasm for the DoT AI tool runs all the way to the top, noting that Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.”

Six DoT workers who spoke to ProPublica anonymously said that typical regulation-writing can take months, and sometimes years, due to the complications involved. But at the demonstration in December, a presenter told them Google’s Gemini could cut that down to “minutes or even seconds.”

Zerzan, for his part, told DoT staffers that the goal is to be able to pump out a new regulation in as little as 30 days. “It shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini,” he told regulators.

Asked for his opinion by ProPublica, the DoT’s former chief AI officer Mike Horton compared the plan to “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.”

For anyone worried about keeping trains on the tracks and planes in the sky, it’s an incredibly troubling development. Large language models (LLMs) like Gemini are prone to errors known as hallucinations. Gemini has been linked to a number of embarrassing episodes, like hallucinating marriages that don’t exist or making up dangerous medical misinformation.

And that’s without getting into how, in April of last year, Gemini users were perturbed as the chatbot abruptly started spitting out screeds that read like disturbing psychological breaks — the last thing you want when dealing with federal regulations on activities as crucial as air traffic control.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nations that defy the US-led world order may soon face a new weapon designed to hamstring defenses, disorient troops, and sow fear into the hearts of its enemies.

In a familiarly bizarre interview with the New York Post, president Donald Trump revealed that US troops had used what he colorfully termed a secret “discombobulator” during the air attack on Caracas, Venezuela earlier this month.

“The discombobulator. I’m not allowed to talk about it,” Trump told the Post. “I would love to,” he said, before claiming that, whatever it is, the device was used in Venezuela. As for what exactly it is, the president was pretty vague.

In the interview, Trump bragged that the device “made [Venezuelan] equipment not work” during the brutal offensive that killed about 100 people and led to the unlawful kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. “They never got their rockets off. They had Russian and Chinese rockets, and they never got one off. We came in, they pressed buttons and nothing worked. They were all set for us.”

As a senior US official told CNN, Trump seems to be conflating a few different systems into one weapon. For example, the US did sabotage Venezuela’s electrical infrastructure and air defense radar systems in a powerful cyberattack, per the New York Times. The White House has also claimed that Venezuelan troops suffered from a “very intense sound wave” during the attack, a likely reference to the Active Denial System, an anti-personnel weapon designed to heat human flesh on contact.

The US wasn’t just interested in knocking out Venezuela’s military capabilities. Civilian infrastructure, such as the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC), was also deliberately targeted in the blitz. Though it was 11 miles away from the closest military installation, the IVIC suffered extensive damage to its mathematics, physics, chemistry, ecology, and nuclear research buildings.

US troops also targeted the La Guaira port in Caracas, the country’s main international shipping hub. According to the publication Venezuela Analysis, medical warehouses belonging to the Venezuelan Social Security Institute were among the targets at La Guaira.

That situation has prompted an emergency response from health authorities in Brazil, who are mobilizing to send badly needed dialysis supplies and medicine to Venezuela.

In a statement to local press, Nelare Bermúdez, an official with La Guaira state’s healthcare authority, said that at least a three-month supply of medicine for kidney disease treatment had been destroyed. Yet if the discombobulator was meant to scare Venezuelans into submission, Bermúdez’s resolve suggests otherwise: “we remain undeterred in our fight to guarantee these health services,” he said.

            <h2>Sam Altman Says OpenAI Is Slashing Its Hiring Pace as Financial Crunch Tightens</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-openai-slashing-hiring">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a memo sent out to staff last month, OpenAI CEO issued a “code red” urging employees to double down on improving the company’s flagship product ChatGPT, as financial pressure loomed and competitors gained ground.

The company continues to frantically chase some much-needed revenue. Despite Altman calling ads a “last resort for us as a business model” in 2024, the company announced earlier this month that ChatGPT will soon start spamming users with them.

Its cash burn rate is immense. The company is planning to spend well over $1 trillion in the coming years on data center infrastructure, despite revenue lagging far behind. Experts have warned that the company could run out of cash within the next 18 months. To its most skeptical critics, it’s an Enron-like financial disaster that’s waiting to happen.

So maybe it’s not surprising that the company is opting to pump the brakes. During a livestreamed town hall event on Monday, Altman said that OpenAI is looking to “dramatically slow down” hiring as the company continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter, as Business Insider reports.

“What I think we shouldn’t do, and what I hope other companies won’t do either, is hire super aggressively, then realize all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation,” Altman told attendees. “So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.”

The news comes amid widespread concerns over soaring unemployment in the US. While consumer spending has increased, the labor market has been hit hard by businesses curbing hiring significantly, often citing heavy investments in AI.

Altman’s admission also suggests that several years of aggressive hiring in the AI sector could be screeching to a halt as the industry continues to face pressure from investors getting antsy about the waning prospects of a return.

The news is particularly notable after years of AI companies embracing an unprecedented hiring spree, desperately trying to poach talent from their competitors by offering them astronomical pay packages.

Whether Altman’s announcement signals that those days are over for good remains to be seen. Big tech’s spending binge is set to drag on in the coming years. Many have already made massive commitments to scale up operations by expanding enormous data centers.

At the same time, selling those future prospects to investors could become more difficult as well. OpenAI, for instance, is already struggling with stalling subscriber growth — and that’s before pestering its users with ads or paywalling existing features behind expensive monthly subscriptions. (The company is currently mulling over how much to charge for ads.)

As former Fidelity manager George Noble fulminated in a scorching thread on X, the AI industry may have already hit a point of diminishing returns. Companies still have a lot to prove — for instance, chatbots still suffer from rampant hallucinations — as the goalposts continue to be moved.

“The low-hanging fruit is gone,” he wrote. “Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.”

Meanwhile, Google — one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors — can rely on an already-established business with existing revenue streams to prop up its AI spending.

In short, Altman’s significant hiring slowdown could be indicative of a tough time ahead. And if critics are to be believed, the wheels could already be starting to come off.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re just days away from NASA’s historic return to the Moon.

The agency’s Artemis 2 mission will see a crew of four astronauts travel far beyond the dark side of the Earth’s natural satellite, reaching the farthest point that humans have ever traveled from Earth. They will get unfettered views of the Moon’s surface during the flyby, getting within just 4,600 miles of its far side, before making their four-day return to Earth.

On Friday, the four astronauts officially entered quarantine in preparation for the mission, a conventional precaution ahead of any prolonged trips into space, to “ensure that they don’t pick up any illness that could delay their mission by limiting their exposure to others in the days before they lift off,” as NASA explained.

“This period, called the health stabilization program, typically starts about 14 days before launch,” the agency wrote. “Beginning quarantine now preserves flexibility as teams work toward potential opportunities in the February launch period.”

The team will still be allowed to be in contact with their friends and family, as long as they “observe quarantine guidelines… avoid public places, wear masks, and maintain distance from others they come into contact with,” per the agency.

NASA will conduct its wet dress rehearsal (WDR) in advance of a launch as early as January 31. The rehearsal is designed to run through the entire launch — while the astronauts are still in quarantine — to ensure that all systems are go.

If all goes according to plan, the agency’s Space Launch System rocket could launch as early as February 6, though an official date has yet to be announced.

However, the rocket has already been rolled out to historic Launch Complex-39B at Kennedy Space Center, alongside the Orion spacecraft that will carry the crew into space.

It’s an exciting prospect, as it’ll be the first time humans have ventured to the Moon in over half a century.

“Artemis 2 will be a momentous step forward for human spaceflight,” said NASA administrator Jared Isaacman in a recent statement. “This historic mission will send humans farther from Earth than ever before and deliver the insights needed for us to return to the Moon — all with America at the helm.”

The space agency’s follow-up mission, Artemis 3, could allow the first astronauts to walk on the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in December 1972.

The mission is scheduled to launch sometime next year, but NASA has plenty of decisions to make — like which spacecraft to pick to carry the crew from lunar orbit down to the surface.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Palmer Luckey’s eyes light up, and he talks a mile a minute, when discussing his company’s new recruiting event: the AI Grand Prix.

This is a drone flying contest with a twist. Rather than humans operating drones, the drones must operate  autonomously. The humans will be tested on their software-writing skills that cause the drones to outfly their competition.

There are prizes ranging from a $500,000 pot to be spilt amongst the highest-scoring teams, to jobs at Anduril, and a chance to bypass the company’s standard recruiting cycle.

“It was something that I decided we should do,” Anduril founder Luckey said in an interview with TechCrunch. Luckey and the team were meeting to discuss recruitment strategy, he recalled.

Someone suggested sponsoring a drone racing tournament, which was somewhat in line with the company’s previous marketing tactics. For instance, Anduril sponsors the NASCAR Cup Series race known as the Anduril 250.

Luckey generally liked the idea but then said, “‘Guys, that would be a really dumb thing for Anduril to sponsor. The whole point, our entire impetus and reason for being, is this pitch that autonomy has finally advanced to where you don’t have to have a person micromanaging each drone,’” he recalled, then adding, “‘What we should really do is sponsor a race that’s about how well programmers and engineers can make a drone fly itself.’”

After discovering that such an event didn’t exist, the company opted to create it themselves. Interestingly, though, Luckey pointed out that the teams in the AI Grand Prix will not be flying Anduril’s drones, but those built by another defense tech startup: Neros Technologies. According to Luckey, Anduril’s drones are too physically big to run in the contained course in Ohio where the finals will take place.

“We talked about having teams use Anduril drones, but Anduril doesn’t make any drones that are of the ultra-high speed, very small nature that you would want for a Drone Racing League. It’s mostly bigger stuff,” he said.

Anduril is also partnering with one of the established racing leagues, the Drone Champions League to operate the event, as well as JobsOhio. The final race will take place in Ohio (where Anduril’s key manufacturing facility is located).

Although Luckey is clearly excited about how fun the event will be, he won’t be a racer himself. “I absolutely will be there,” he says, but “it’s going to be about who can build the best software to pilot these drones.”

He smiled and said, “I’m not actually a very good software programmer. I’m more of a hardware guy. I’m an electromechanical and optical guy, and I know just enough about coding to glue stuff together in a way that works for my prototypes.”

(Luckey calls Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf “our de facto lead software brains” at the company.)

The founder is hoping for at least 50 teams, and already has interest from multiple universities, he said. Should this competition be a successful event, the plan is to expand it into races with the other types of autonomous vehicles.

“We are starting with these quadcopter racing drones, which is what people expect from drone racing. However, we want to be, in the future, applying AI racing to other platforms as well,” he said.

Underwater AI racing, ground AI racing, potentially even AI racing of spacecraft were some of the ideas Luckey shared.

The contest is open to all international excluding teams from Russia.

“The difference with Russia is they are actively engaged in the act of invading Europe,” he said.

The concern is that the people qualified to enter such a race may also be working for their nation’s military. “I would love to have everybody, but we’re not the Olympics,” he added.

Luckey said the event was following the lead from the World Cup, which has also excluded Russia.

Interestingly, teams from China (home to a lot of autonomous engineering) are welcome, despite it being the country that U.S. autonomous weapons hawks often name as their biggest fear.

Should a Chinese team win, the prize of a job at Anduril, which makes weapons used by the U.S. military, would not be a given. “If you work for the Chinese military, you’re not going to be allowed to get a job at Anduril,” Luckey said. Certain laws apply, he pointed out. In fact, there will still be some interviews and qualification process for all the job candidates.

The competition will take place across three qualifying rounds beginning in April with the final Grand Prix race scheduled for November.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/bluesky-teases-2026-roadmap-a-better-discover-feed-real-time-features-and-more/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Social network Bluesky is teasing its roadmap for the year ahead, emphasizing a focus on things like improving the app’s algorithmic Discover feed, offering its users better recommendations on who to follow, giving the app more of a real-time feel, and more.

At the same time, the company admitted that it needs to work on getting the “basics” right, too.

Launched to the public in early 2024 after an invite-only period, the decentralized X and Threads alternative has since scaled to over 42 million users, according to data sourced directly from the Bluesky API for developers.

Though it’s differentiated from mainstream social media with its custom feeds and configurable algorithms, Bluesky hasn’t caught up to rivals with regard to basic features, like private accounts, drafts, support for longer videos, and more.

Bluesky’s head of product, Alex Benzer, acknowledged some of these concerns in a new post on the company’s website, where he said that the “basics need to be solid” before Bluesky can expect users to stick around.

Those remarks come after a usage slowdown on Bluesky, which saw a 40% year-over-year drop in daily active users as of October 2025, according to data from market intelligence provider Similarweb, as reported by Forbes.

In addition to supporting drafts, Benzer said the app’s composer should handle media better, noting that three-minute-long videos aren’t enough, and videos should upload faster. Plus, he wants Bluesky to support posting more than four photos at a time, and thinks threads should be easier to create, too.

The need for private accounts wasn’t addressed, but those will take longer to realize, Bluesky has previously explained. The plan is for the underlying protocol, the AT Protocol (or AT Proto for short), to eventually support private accounts. But that won’t be coming anytime soon.

Benzer also pointed to improvements to the app’s Discover feed, which could add topic tags as a way to guide people to posts related to their interests. “Who to follow” suggestions will also be improved, as finding high-quality connections can improve the overall user experience.

Benzer believes that Bluesky needs to have more of a “real-time” feel, whether that’s around events like sports, or political moments of interest like elections. The company is building curation tools for its team to make high-quality and timely custom feeds available during live events, he said. The team is exploring other new features within feeds that would make these feeds feel “less like just scrolling through posts and more like hanging out,” Benzer said. (What that means, we’re not exactly sure!)

In terms of growing the overall ecosystem, which the community has dubbed the “Atmosphere,” the company will look to improve interoperability with other apps that are also built on the underlying AT Protocol.

For instance, if you go live on Twitch or Streamplace, another app powered by the AT Protocol, you’ll see a LIVE badge appear on your profile photo on Bluesky.

Benzer said another integration like this is coming “soon.”

While Bluesky has succeeded in adding users, actual usage on Bluesky ebbs and flows, with surges often timed to changes at X or moments of political tension. Meanwhile, Meta’s Threads has become the next-nearest competitor to X. New third-party data indicates that Threads is now outpacing X in daily mobile users, though X was still ahead on the desktop web.

Threads’ main advantage is that it’s backed by the resources of a tech giant, allowing for heavy cross-promotion, easier onboarding, and tons of resources. As a result, Threads has been rapidly shipping new features over the past year or so, including things like interest-based communities, better filters, DMs, long-form text, and disappearing posts. That’s helped to differentiate it from X and gain traction among users, including those who want a network that favors creator content over politics, which Threads had deprioritized up until a year ago.

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has doubled the amount of VC funding it aims to raise, the FT reports, increasing the target from $10 billion to $20 billion. The round, expected to close soon, will give the company a valuation of $350 billion, sources told the FT.

Anthropic, which makes the popular AI Claude and the equally popular Claude Code, decided to double its funding target due to booming investor interest. Backers in this round are expected to include Sequoia Capital (which also invests in its rival OpenAI), Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, and investment management firm Coatue, per the FT.

Late last year, it was reported that Anthropic hired lawyers as a step toward prepping for an IPO that could come sometime this year. The company announced a $13 billion raise in September, making it one of the industry’s most valuable private companies, valued at $183 billion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon has reached a settlement valued at more than $1 billion to resolve claims that it failed to properly refund customers for their returns. The settlement includes more than $600 million already distributed or soon to be paid in refunds, plus additional funds that will be paid out to affected consumers, according to court documents.

Under the settlement, Amazon will pay $309.5 million into a non-reversionary common fund, a pool of money set aside for members of the class-action lawsuit. The company has already issued about $570 million in refunds, with about $34 million of refunds remaining. Reuters was first to report on the settlement.

The e-commerce giant has also agreed to provide over $363 million in non‑monetary relief to enhance its return and refund processes, according to court documents. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.

The lawsuit, filed in 2023, alleged that Amazon caused “substantial unjustified monetary losses” for consumers who returned an item but were still charged for it.

“Following an internal review in 2025, we identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent back to us, so no refund had been issued,” Amazon said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “We started issuing refunds in 2025 for these returns and are providing additional compensation and refunds to eligible customers per the settlement agreement.”

Amazon agreed to pay $2.5 billion last year to settle the FTC’s lawsuit that accused the company of tricking users into subscribing to Prime and making it difficult to cancel. Amazon is currently accepting claims from impacted customers.

            <div id="article-text">TikTok settled a high-profile lawsuit on Monday evening, which alleges that social media companies intentionally make their products addictive, causing harm to users. Snap settled the case last week, but Meta and YouTube — the other defendants — are now heading to trial, where jury selection begins on Tuesday.

Centering around a 19-year-old plaintiff known by the initials K.G.M., this case is the first of many similar legal challenges against social platforms. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and YouTube head Neal Mohan are expected to testify, which could set a precedent for how dozens of other lawsuits could play out.

By settling the case, TikTok and Snap are not necessarily admitting to the allegations. Rather, they came to an agreement with the plaintiff outside of court, though the terms of these settlements are not known.

            <div id="article-text">On a Monday night NBC News segment, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei expressed concern over “some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days,” referring to the violence of Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis.

Amodei focused on the importance of preserving democracy at home, both on NBC and in a post on X that specifically called out “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” On NBC, he said he’s a believer in arming democracies to defend against autocratic countries, and that “we need to defend our own democratic values at home.” He added that Anthropic has no contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Meanwhile, in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees that got leaked to The New York Times, Sam Altman said, “What’s happening with ICE is going too far.”

“Part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach,” Altman wrote. “There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”

Tech workers, including employees of both companies, have been calling on their chiefs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities in the aftermath of Border Patrol agents killing two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.

Employees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.

“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch. “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”

While Amodei and Altman may be taking something of a stand — one in public, the other internally — both CEOs couched their statements with praise for President Trump, as well.

Amodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an independent investigation into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Alex Pretti’s death circulated online. (It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a growing number of Republicans have begun to call for an investigation, as well.)

In Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities.

J.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”

Of course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year; OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another $25 billion at a $350 billion valuation.

Still, such words of praise for Trump is an about-face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his own blog:

“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”

At that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”

“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.

And Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, calling the decision “crazy” last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”

Whether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.

            <h2>How Republicans Forced Trump to Shift Course in Minnesota</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/alex-pretti-shooting-trump-ice-minneapolis/685780/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The statements from congressional Republicans after Saturday’s shooting of Alex Pretti were relatively mild. Lawmakers said that they were “deeply troubled” or “disturbed” by the second killing of an American citizen by federal immigration officers this month; most called for an investigation into Pretti’s death. But the statements kept coming, one after another, all through the weekend and into yesterday.

The reactions from across the GOP sent an unmistakable message in their volume, if not in their rhetoric, to Donald Trump: Enough. The defining characteristics of the Republican-controlled Congress during the president’s second term have been silence and acquiescence. That so many in his party felt compelled to speak up after Pretti’s killing was a sign that Republicans had finally lost patience with federal agents occupying a major American city—a deportation operation that has soured the public on one of Trump’s signature policies and sunk the GOP’s standing at the outset of a crucial midterm-election year.

Republican committee chairs in both the House and the Senate summoned top administration officials to public hearings—a rarity in the past year. From the right, the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocates criticized comments from senior law-enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel, that blamed Pretti for carrying a firearm and said that people should not bring guns to public demonstrations. (Videos showed that officers disarmed Pretti before they fatally shot him.) Few Republican leaders rushed to defend the unnamed agent who’d killed Pretti, nor did they echo the rhetoric of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, who referred to Pretti, an ICU nurse, as a “would-be assassin.” In at least one case, the lack of comment from a top Republican was significant: House Speaker Mike Johnson—ordinarily quick to pick up talking points from the president and his top aides—has said nothing about the shooting.

The harshest Republican condemnation came from one of the party’s candidates for governor of Minnesota, Chris Madel, who yesterday declared that he was quitting the race in part because of the federal deployment. “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state,” Madel said in his video announcement, “nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.”

Watching all of this unfold was Trump, who already did not like what he saw. For the president, it was a rare winter weekend when he wasn’t in Palm Beach or at the golf course. He never left the White House. And he was glued to news coverage that showed little besides another horrific shooting in Minnesota. Videos of Pretti’s killing were inescapable on TV and social media, and the story broke through to nonpolitical media—drawing reactions from the likes of Charles Barkley and Bill Simmons—in ways that the fatal shooting of Renee Good on January 7 did not.

Trump’s first move was to defend the federal officers carrying out the immigration operations in the moments before the deadly clash. He reposted a Department of Homeland Security–supplied photo of the gun Pretti had been carrying, before again making claims about fraud in Minnesota’s immigrant communities. But he otherwise remained publicly silent as more videos of the shooting cast doubt on the administration’s statements about what had happened.

Trump began asking aides and outside advisers if it had been an “okay” shooting, trying to figure out whether the agents had made the right decision to fire, a White House official and two allies close to the West Wing told us. His top aides, among them Miller—including in a post that was amplified by Vice President Vance—immediately blamed Pretti for instigating violence (as the administration blamed Good after her death) and suggested, without evidence, that Pretti had been a “domestic terrorist.”

But this time, fewer Republicans joined the chorus. And as the weekend wore on, more GOP lawmakers and conservative media voices began to call for an investigation into the shooting and to question the administration’s assertion that an armed Pretti had violently resisted agents. Senator John Curtis of Utah called out Noem by name, saying that he disagreed with her “premature” response to the shooting.

Trump grew concerned at the response, the White House official and one outside ally told us. He again on Sunday demanded more cooperation from local officials and blamed Democratic lawmakers for violence in Minnesota—but he noticeably did not defend the officers who’d shot Pretti, in either his posts or in a brief interview with The Wall Street Journal. The president, who has long enjoyed near-total fealty from Republicans, took note of the lawmakers calling for a probe or quietly suggesting that federal officials roll back operations in the Twin Cities. (He was glad that the lawmakers did not blame him personally for the administration’s response, one of the allies told us.)

Trump was particularly bothered by the NRA&#39;s strong reply to an assistant U.S. attorney in California appointed by the administration who said that if a person approaches law enforcement with a gun, there is a “high likelihood” that officers will be “legally justified in shooting you.” Trump has long prided himself on the support he receives from those he calls “my Second Amendment people,” and he has often been deferential to the gun lobby despite its waning influence.

When something becomes too controversial for Trump’s liking—or when the blowback becomes too fierce—he has in many cases a way to declare some sort of victory, even a far-fetched one, and then move on (as he did with Greenland last week). Aides wondered whether he was trying to do the same with Minneapolis. Yesterday, Trump appointed his designated “border czar,” Tom Homan, to head the federal operation in Minnesota. Although most Democrats are deeply skeptical of Homan, he has not been involved in the Twin Cities operations and has been more consistently careful with his language than Miller or Noem. (After Good’s killing, Homan said that he would reserve judgment on the matter until an investigation had concluded.) Trump later claimed, after a phone call, that he and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are largely aligned in their goals for the federal operation—and even offered some faint praise for the governor, who is under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly impeding the operation of immigration agents.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that if local officials increased their cooperation with the federal government, Border Patrol agents would “no longer be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota.” The administration decided to pull some federal agents out of Minnesota, aides said, but did not suggest a sweeping overhaul to the mission in the state or to Trump’s broader immigration agenda.

Trump’s unease, along with pushback from Republicans, grew by the hour and forced a major change: As The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff first reported, the administration yesterday ousted Gregory Bovino from his role as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large” and removed him from Minnesota, where he had become the public face of the federal operation. Many in Trump’s orbit saw Bovino as an easy scapegoat; he’d claimed, without evidence, that Pretti had planned to attack federal agents. (His choice of coat and interactions with Minnesotans in social-media posts had also generated an uproar.) Despite this, a senior administration official insisted that Bovino’s transfer had been in the works before the announcement of Homan’s new role. Not all of Trump’s allies were happy with the change in Minneapolis. “You can’t sugarcoat this,” the Trump ally Steve Bannon said on his podcast. “It wasn’t just a blink. It was a crater.”

Last night, the president met for two hours in the Oval Office with Noem and one of her top advisers, the former Trump-campaign chief Corey Lewandowski, but the senior official made clear to us that no additional leadership changes are imminent. Leavitt, in her briefing, also said that Trump continues to have confidence in Noem. For the moment, she remains at her job.

            <h2>What Should Americans Do Now?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/minneapolis-ice-protests-democracy/685778/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The killings in Minneapolis of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have been compared to the murder of George Floyd, because they all happened within a few miles of one another, and because of the outrage they inspired. There’s an important difference, though: In 2020 the United States was in turmoil, but it was still a state of law. Floyd’s death was followed by investigation, trial, and verdict—by justice. The Minneapolis Police Department was held accountable and ultimately made to reform.

No one should expect justice for Good and Pretti. Today, nothing stands in the way of the brutal tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol. While President Trump seems to be trying to defuse the mayhem he’s caused by reassigning a top commander, he is not withdrawing the federal agents from the state or allowing local authorities to investigate, let alone prosecute, them for their actions.

Authoritarianism doesn’t disappear with the news cycle. The administration’s automatic lies about the killings and slander of the victims are less a cover-up of facts than a display of utter contempt for them. Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, FBI Director Kash Patel, and other top officials seem to invite incredulity as a way to flex their power: We say black is white. Agree or you’re a criminal. When Stephen Miller recently claimed that geopolitics is ruled by the “iron laws” of “strength” and “force,” he was expressing the administration’s approach to domestic governance as well. Those words are iron laws on American streets.

The prelude to the violence of January 7 and 24 came not in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, but in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021. Trump and his supporters were prevented from stealing an election and overthrowing the Constitution by democratic institutions—Congress, the courts, the police, the media, and public opinion. But the insurrection never ended. By the time Trump returned to power and pardoned the insurrectionists, almost half of the country believed that January 6 was a patriotic demonstration, a false-flag operation, or just no big deal. Throughout 2025, institutions that once restrained the presidency weakened or fell away one by one, until earlier this month Trump told The New York Times that the only limit to his power is his own mind. That same day, January 7, authoritarianism had its predictable consequence in freezing Minneapolis with the execution of Renee Good.

If rogue federal agents can shoot American citizens dead with total impunity, then it doesn’t matter whether state and local authorities, the courts, the media, the political opposition, and a mobilized public object. “ICE > MN,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media—an assertion of raw force, not constitutional authority. When Trump and his loyalists call protesters terrorists and warn that disobeying orders will get you killed, they strip away any illusion that the federal government respects the lives, let alone the rights, of those who oppose it—potentially half the population or more.

A lawless regime is an illegitimate one. If the country seems to have reached a breaking point in Minneapolis, this is why. And yet Minneapolis also offers a compelling answer to the question that democracy-loving Americans have asked for the past year: What can I do?

No historical precedent exists for where we are. Individuals and groups have often accused the U.S. government of denying their rights, and some of those accusations were irrefutable—as in the century between Appomattox and Selma, when the rights of Black Americans were denied throughout the South with the connivance of Washington. Some, though, were shams. In 1861, the Confederacy declared the government in Washington illegitimate and fired the first shots of the Civil War, not because any rights had been taken away from southern states—not even the right to hold human beings in bondage—but because they hated and feared Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party. After the 2020 election, MAGA tried to claim that the election had been stolen and a Biden presidency would be illegitimate; truth and the law prevailed.

The federal government has never declared itself immune to the law and the Constitution while explicitly denying protection to peaceful opponents, until now. Many Americans who thought they were living under the rule of law feel paralyzed. The vague exhortation to “do something while you still can” creates a sense of urgency but doesn’t provide a plan. Rather than inspiring action, the question of what to do more likely leaves you feeling depressed and alone. Not even the prospect of waiting out the year until the midterms provides much reassurance. Trump has made it clear that he will try to undermine any election that might cost him some of his power.

Without a constructive answer, the danger is that Americans who find themselves without legal remedies will turn to illegal and violent ones. That would be a catastrophic mistake, both strategically and morally.

So far, action has come in the form of either legal challenge or protest, including speeches and writings by politicians and public figures, and the occasional nationwide demonstrations known as “No Kings,” which draw on patriotic imagery and the historic American aversion to tyranny. The key to the popularity of No Kings lies in its unifying name. The focus is not a single issue, such as abortion, immigration, Ukraine, or Gaza, but a broad stance against autocracy and for democracy. Its demonstrations are orderly, peaceful, good-tempered, and irreverent, featuring countless American flags. No Kings hasn’t been hijacked by leftist groups with more extreme agendas, spouting strident anti-American language that’s bound to repel ordinary people. But No Kings has been inconspicuous since October. It will have to transform itself into something much more potent than a once-a-quarter day of demonstration.

George Packer: Why the ‘No Kings’ protest moved me

In Minneapolis, as the scale and intensity of oppression increased, the answer to “What can I do?” evolved from protest to something riskier and more demanding: nonviolent resistance. As my colleague Robert Worth has reported, networks of Minneapolitans that had formed after Floyd’s murder to protect their neighborhoods from both out-of-control police and rioters have been revived in the past few months to protect their immigrant neighbors from the invasion of federal agents. Residents undergo training in nonviolent resistance, which demands courage, wisdom, and restraint; they bring food to those hiding at home, escort children to school, and stand watch outside; they blow whistles and send out alerts on encrypted chats to signal the presence of ICE vehicles, and follow them; they try to de-escalate confrontations (sometimes with the opposite result), provide medical aid to the injured, and shame masked agents in military gear who seem poorly trained and undisciplined compared with the civilians.

Given the level of rage on the streets, the conduct of these local networks has been remarkable. One older suburban woman—nothing like the “lunatics,” “domestic terrorists,” or “assassins” Trump and his advisers see in Minneapolis—told Worth that she doesn’t even consider her involvement political. Her preferred term for what she’s doing is humanist. It could be a byword for the whole opposition to a cruel and predatory regime.

Minneapolis is setting an example for the rest of the country: a nameless, leaderless, self-organized movement. Self-organization is a term I heard from almost everyone I met in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion. It’s an inherently hard form of activism, requiring high levels of motivation and trust. These obviously exist in the neighborhoods of South Minneapolis, where civic spirit and personal connections run deep. But replicating them on a wider scale—essentially, creating a mass movement for basic decency—raises obvious problems. That movement’s energy might depend on the arrival of conspicuous federal oppression in other blue cities and states (which Trump has promised). It would have to remain decentralized and maintain its local integrity while creating a capacity for nationwide coordination. It could fall apart for lack of discipline, coherence, trust, and leadership—or, conversely, because of leadership that devolves into factionalism. The civil-rights movement confronted all of these problems, and overcame them.

No Kings or another group could consider organizing and training people in other parts of the country to join the kind of civic action on display in Minneapolis—to move from protest to nonviolent resistance. Beyond neighbor-to-neighbor support in a moment of crisis lies a wide range of means to withhold cooperation from an illegitimate government. The late theorist Gene Sharp laid them out, along with ideas for strategic planning, in books such as From Dictatorship to Democracy and Waging Nonviolent Struggle. Sharp’s work has been used as an essential guide for democracy activists under dictatorial regimes in countries such as Serbia, Burma, and Iran. Americans should pick up these books and absorb their lessons.

Sharp analyzed various “methods of noncooperation”—political, economic, and social—that stop short of more aggressive disruptions. They include boycotts and strikes (such as the widely observed general strike in Minneapolis last Friday); refusal to participate in administration-supported organizations and events; “quasi-legal evasions and delays” and “reluctant and slow compliance” with government edicts; and finally, nonviolent civil disobedience. Anti-ICE actions that try to thwart the brutal and indiscriminate enforcement of immigration laws can become a form of civil disobedience.

Nonviolent struggle carries serious risks. It can lead to social ostracism, legal harassment, state intimidation, prison, injury, and, as we’ve seen in Minneapolis, death. One sign of the authoritarian depth to which the U.S. has sunk under Trump is that none of these risks is hard to imagine. Examples accumulate every day. A movement of resistance against an illegitimate regime has a chance of succeeding only if it remains strictly nonviolent and avoids the familiar trap of sectarianism. It has to be democratic, patriotic, and animated by a sense of basic decency that can attract ordinary people—your TV-watching mother, your apathetic teen, your child’s teacher, the retiree next door, the local grocer.

I keep asking myself whether it’s wise to even consider these things. I don’t want to sound alarmist, or delusional, or needlessly provocative. For an American who grew up in the postwar order with its apparently permanent rules, in a democracy with obvious flaws that nonetheless seemed on a course of gradual, inevitable progress, I find it extremely hard to assess the peril. I’m tempted to believe that the country will somehow return to normal, because I want it to be normal. We’ve never been here before, and either the nervous system overreacts or the imagination fails. After Minneapolis, I fear the latter more. Trump is taking the country on a path to tyranny. The first obligation for each of us is to see it and name it. The next is to figure out what to do about it.</div>

            <h2>A Reckoning for the Tech Right</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/minneapolis-reckoning-tech-right/685781/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hours after Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy showed up for a movie night at the White House. Along with other business executives and several prominent Donald Trump supporters, they attended a private screening of Melania, a new documentary about the president’s wife. The moviegoers were treated to buckets of popcorn and sugar cookies frosted with the first lady’s name.

Silicon Valley’s top executives have seemingly taken every opportunity to cozy up to Trump. During his inauguration a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, and Cook sat smiling behind the president in the Capitol Rotunda. The obsequiousness has not stopped since: In August, Cook presented Trump with a custom plaque atop a 24-karat-gold base in the Oval Office. At a White House dinner the next month, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin praised Trump’s “civil rights” work, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman described Trump’s leadership as a “refreshing change.” Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are among the companies that have made donations to fund the new White House ballroom.

Tech has a long history of making moves to appease politicians in power, including ample campaign donations. But the industry’s leaders have not distanced themselves from Trump even as his administration has shattered constitutional and democratic norms. In Minneapolis over the weekend, an American citizen was shot in the street by masked federal officers after recording them with his phone. In the immediate aftermath, top Trump-administration officials blamed Pretti for his own death, despite contradictory video evidence. The uproar has been loud, and not just among Democrats. So far, Silicon Valley’s top CEOs have largely remained silent.

Read: Billions of people in the palm of Trump’s hand

In some ways, tech’s rightward shift in 2024 was overstated. The embrace of Trump was mostly concentrated among a small pack of investors and executives, who had a quieting effect on the rest of the industry. In the past few days, the gulf between the top brass and the rank and file has grown. Hundreds of employees from major companies including Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, and beyond have signed a statement asking the industry’s CEOs to call the White House and comment publicly against the violence. Several well-respected voices in the industry have spoken up: “Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this,” Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, posted on X after the shooting. “The video was sickening to watch,” wrote the investor Vinod Khosla, who called out the administration’s “storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts.” Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, one of the few major Silicon Valley CEOs to have expressed his condemnation, took the opportunity to warn against the “reluctance of tech companies to criticize the US government.”

Altman reportedly rebuked the administration in an internal post to OpenAI employees, writing that “what’s happening with ICE is going too far.” He added that the president is “a very strong leader” who he hopes “will rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Yet there is little reason to believe that Silicon Valley’s uppermost ranks will more formally break with Trump. If anything, as the midterm elections approach, some executives appear to be doubling down on their support. This fall, Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, and his wife, Anna, donated $25 million to Trump’s super PAC. And Elon Musk recently signaled his political return with a $10 million donation to the pro-Trump candidate running to succeed Mitch McConnell—the Tesla CEO’s largest-ever single contribution to a Senate candidate. (Jassy, Cook, and Greg Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, which has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic, has previously said that the Brockmans’ donations were made in a personal capacity.)

During Trump’s first term in office, a number of these tech leaders were outspoken in criticizing him: In 2017, Brin showed up to a protest against Trump’s Muslim ban, and Altman spoke with 100 Trump voters across the country to figure out what it would take to “convince them not to vote for him in the future.” Greg Brockman previously donated to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. It’s conceivable that these leaders’ political views changed, of course, but the groveling reads obviously as strategy. Trump is a dealmaker, and playing to his administration is good for business. Already, tech companies have gained a lot by cozying up to Trump, including relaxed AI regulation and tariff exemptions.

This all risks being a short-term, transactional game. In the long run, tech executives’ alignment with the president could easily backfire. “The Trump supporters in Silicon Valley are making the same mistake as all powerful people who back authoritarians,” the venture capitalist Michael Moritz warned in 2024. “They are, I suspect, seduced by the notion that because of their means, they will be able to control Trump.” But Trump is mercurial: He will do as he pleases. As tech executives continue schmoozing with the president, there are no guarantees that they will get anything in return.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Whatever you might think you’re going to get from the familiar setup of Jennette McCurdy’s Half His Age (a lonely high-school girl in Anchorage begins an extremely questionable sexual relationship with her teacher), any presumptions are dispelled from the very first page. When Waldo, the teenage narrator of the novel, observes her boyfriend’s “slimy tongue that loop-de-loops over and over like a carnival ride, mechanical and passionless,” she’s setting a tone: irreverent, graphic, bilious.

McCurdy is much more interested in late capitalism than in Lolita. Waldo’s world has long been poisoned by the microwavable meals her disinterested mother leaves out, the fast-fashion crop tops she orders that come with a cancer warning, the laptop she falls asleep clutching at 2 a.m., its unnatural heat “searing my ovaries.” By the time she meets Mr. Korgy, her frowsy middle-aged creative-writing instructor, on page 11, she is already imprinted on the reader as a caustic force of anti-nature.

And so she seduces Korgy—of course she does. Their relationship ensues through the slow erosion of boundaries, mostly instigated by her but sometimes by him. She masturbates using a bottle of tropical-fruit-flavored Tums while stalking his Instagram. He praises her writing and asks her to stay after class; he later invites her to dinner at his home with his wife. She sends him a thank-you email with her phone number. He calls her. And so on, until they’re frantically humping in a janitorial closet, in her childhood bedroom, at hotels (after fancy dinners where people assume he’s her father). Mr. Korgy—his first name is Theodore, but Waldo never uses it—is no scheming predator. His wife calls him “Teddy” and tells emasculating anecdotes about him. He’s soft and pitiable where Waldo is ferocious in her loneliness and adept at transforming herself into various alluring guises.

Literature is rife with memoirs and works of autofiction about ravening English teachers, accounts of mentors who allegedly groomed vulnerable girls with writing and manipulated their own words. Half His Age is resolutely not one of these books. But McCurdy, who, as a child, starred in Nickelodeon shows alongside Ariana Grande and Miranda Cosgrove, knows well all the ways underage girls can be flattened and plasticized by adults—turned into objects. Her previous book, I’m Glad My Mom Died, recounted McCurdy’s childhood being coerced into performing by her narcissistic and mentally unstable mother, who introduced her daughter to ritualized anorexia at the age of 11 and was such a hoarder, storing objects in every bedroom in the house, that her children had to sleep on Costco mats on the living-room floor. (McCurdy also wrote about a man she called The Creator, widely speculated to be the Nickelodeon executive Dan Schneider, who has faced multiple accusations of inappropriate conduct and abuse; Schneider has denied many of the allegations, but apologized for making people uncomfortable on set.)

Read: Don’t judge I’m Glad My Mom Died by its title

Half His Age, though, isn’t about abuse, or exploitation, or even the power dynamics of what we now call “age-gap relationships,” even as Waldo is bracingly aware of the occasions when Mr. Korgy manipulates her emotionally, and far too astute to fall for his “I want to expose you to art and films and music and books” schtick. The book reads much more like a postmodern novel for the fast-fashion generation, a portrait of civilizational decline told through declining mall chains, ultra-processed foods, and relentless consumption. Online shopping isn’t just a compulsion for Waldo—it’s an assertion of her existence.

Temporally, Half His Age is hard to place. Waldo refers to Instagram and TikTok but doesn’t scroll; she obsesses over her appearance, grooming herself with rigor and self-loathing, but doesn’t post pictures of herself or seem to have an online footprint beyond her shopping orders. She lives in Alaska, but all we hear about it is that her summer days are “bloated” and her winters bleak. Her local hangouts are wholly generic: Waldo works at Victoria’s Secret to fund her shopping habit, eats breakfast with her mom at Denny’s, and survives on Auntie Anne’s pretzels, Marie Callender’s entrees, and Sour Patch Kids. She rattles off cosmetic brand names the same way Mr. Korgy lists his favorite directors (“Bergman and Kubrick and Kurosawa, Lonergan and Linklater and Solondz”)—as a way of underscoring her identity, even if it’s homogenous. Brands are omnipresent in her life, as extant as air. (When the two have sex in Korgy’s car, the feeling of Cheerio crumbs being ground into Waldo’s knees becomes a staple part of the experience.)

McCurdy’s brittle commentary made me think of Don DeLillo’s description of the supermarket in White Noise, with all the hyperreal produce “sprayed, burnished, bright” and inserted into “filmy bags.” At some point in the 20th century, the critic Cynthia Deitering has written of that novel, humanity oversaw one of its most profound transformations: “a shift from a culture defined by its production to a culture defined by its waste.” In DeLillo’s imagination, the specter hovering over all of this unnatural abundance is death; in McCurdy’s, it’s desire. How is Waldo supposed to know what she really wants when her synapses are distorted by the dopamine thrill of acquisition, the heart-stopping kick of something new? She’s not exactly surrounded by appealing prospects. “You think some beefy senior’s gonna be emotionally available between his rounds of Grand Theft Auto and his daily hour of Pornhub?” she tells Mr. Korgy. What she’s most drawn to in her teacher is the way he seems to live outside her dull, trashy monoculture. But his Crate & Barrel throw pillows are no more authentic than her mom’s HOME SWEET HOME Target doormat, or the Le Labo candles and coffee-table books at Waldo’s rich friend Frannie’s house. When Korgy Amazon-ships Waldo a grocery order of some of his favorite nourishing foods, she can manage only three bites of the “chocolate paleo crunch granola with almond milk” before throwing it away.

In structural terms, Half His Age is much more thrilling in the first half than in the second, when Waldo’s frenzied fixation on Mr. Korgy curdles into a much more predictable entanglement. But McCurdy’s furious writing—her dystopian rendering of a culture squandering its dreams and desires on the crack high of cheap stuff—is hard to tear yourself away from. “Few adult persons can see nature,” another Waldo once wrote. Is that kind of transcendent communion with the real world even possible anymore? Half His Age might make you wonder.

            <h2>Never Fight Alone</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2006, I helped establish the NATO Special Operations Forces Command in Mons, Belgium. It included commandos from more than 19 nations. Over the course of the next two years, we trained and exercised together, drank together, and spent family time together. In doing so, we learned that our common values were much more important than our national differences. We also developed a bond that only men preparing for combat can appreciate.

By 2008, I was back fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq, I was blessed to have the British Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) serving alongside my Rangers, SEALs, and Delta Force operators. The Brits took on one of the toughest missions in our counterterrorism fight: the suicide-bomber network operating in Baghdad. Their work unquestionably saved the lives of American soldiers and our allies. And they paid a high price for standing alongside us. In 2005, British special military units lost 10 personnel when one of their C-130s was shot down outside the city. We mourned their loss as if they were our own.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: The sacrifice of the Danes

In Afghanistan, NATO special-operations soldiers fought with tremendous courage and unwavering loyalty to their American counterparts. That commitment did not come without a cost, either. I stood on the tarmac in Bagram and Kandahar many times paying my final respects to soldiers from the U.K., Canada, Australia, France, Denmark, and Germany. Never have I seen such an outpouring of respect and admiration for their contribution to the fight. I also mourned the loss of the first Romanian soldier to have died in combat since World War II—just one of the 27 who fell in Afghanistan.

Many other nations contributed to the NATO mission and lost young men and women because we asked them for their help. We asked them for their help, and most didn’t hesitate. They understood the value of our alliance. They understood the power of being united in a common cause. They believed in NATO and they believed in the United States.

Anyone who would denigrate the service of our NATO allies clearly never spent a day in uniform. These NATO soldiers were as courageous, as heroic, as patriotic, and as loyal as any soldier I ever served with. I, for one, am forever grateful for their service and their sacrifice.

Winston Churchill once said that “there is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them.” If we continue to show disdain for our allies, if we fail to appreciate their contribution to our national security and greater global stability, we may find ourselves fighting alone someday. And trust me, war is never a contest you want to fight alone.</div>

            <h2>The Marathon <em>Moby-Dick</em> Reading Is a Radical Act</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/marathon-moby-dick-reading-radical-act/685775/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly as old as Ahab (one more birthday and I’ll be 58: his age), I drive south from Boston on a recent Saturday morning. Through a raging drabness of Massachusetts wintertime, I drive and drive: leaky light without a source; seething, decaying snow.

I’m on a mission here. A collision with immensity awaits: the 2026 Moby-Dick Marathon at the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Programming, scholarship, and—the event’s steadily droning core—a 25-hour cover-to-cover reading of the great book itself. Hundreds of volunteer readers, in five-minute increments, from noon on Saturday to 1 p.m. on Sunday. A test of my fortitude as a listener, of my ability to keep my behind in a seat.

But I am faint. Succor is required. I pull over at the Bridgewater Service Plaza because sometimes what you need is to quietly conform yourself to the will of God, and sometimes what you need is a cup of stinking black coffee and a Dunkin’ glazed doughnut.

Into snowy New Bedford, into the Whaling Museum, into the room where they keep the Lagoda, the museum’s half-scale model of a whaling bark. A room with a ship in it, in other words. Two stories high (to accommodate the ship’s masts) and stuffed, draped, festooned with humanity: sitters, knitters, nesters, kneelers, sprawlers, leaners, drifters like me, stashed in every alcove and stretched along every railing and baseboard. At noon on the nose, the Massachusetts poet laureate, Regie Gibson, steps up to the lectern: “Call me … Ishmael.” The whoop, the sound of exulting Moby-Dick nuts, goes raggedly around the galleries and hallways of the museum. The tale begins, of course, in New Bedford, where Ishmael arrives “on a Saturday night in December” in search of a whaling voyage. We have embarked.

Moby-Dick, by Herman Melville, published in 1851. Let’s consider it. Is there another book at once so good and so bad, so thrilling and so boring, so authentic to the currents of the soul and so hideously contrived, so stunningly patrolled by dreamlike visions and so crushed by its own intellectual baggage?

There’s no denying the power, the pull, of its mighty twin symbols: burning-eyed indeflectible Ahab, captain of the Pequod, emblem of every human obsession, of the violence of the mind; and his quarry, the white whale, the lump of metaphysical mystique known as Moby Dick. Psychic facts, both of them. But what a welter of chaos they must rise through to reach us—what sub–Thomas Carlyle thunderings, what sub–Sir Thomas Browne conceits and curlicues, what sub-Shakespearean rants. Shakespeare especially: a terrible influence on Melville! All the interior monologues in Moby-Dick, and almost anything that comes out of the mouth of Ahab—all those reams of hoarse Elizabethan bluster—you can blame on Melville’s 1849 devouring of a new seven-volume edition of Shakespeare’s plays, in large print (he had weak eyes). Enthusiastic American, as he began writing Moby-Dick, he was wildly cranked on the Bard. But wait, hist, soft, listen—now we’re on Chapter 7, and a reader speaks out a perfect line of Shakespearean blank verse: “Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs.” Beautiful. I kiss my hand to you, Herman.

Melville would have enjoyed the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Like him, it is given to the grand gesture: whale skeletons suspended from the ceiling, floating above us like hierarchs at a superior level of being; the aforementioned room with a ship in it; and, right by the table where I buy my endless sustaining blueberry muffins and meat pies and cups of tea, a 600-pound life-size model in fiberglass of a blue whale’s heart, its ventricles large enough for a man to crawl into.

The readers: They are everyone. They have every quality. They are stammering, assured, dubious, virtuosic, inaudible, room-shaking, thick-voiced, thin-voiced, professional, innocent, mesmerizing, devoid of presence. It’s an American pageant, purely democratic, intensely moving. Reader by reader, the thread of meaning, the pulse, comes and goes. Some of them seem to seize us by the very roots of our comprehension; others might as well be reading from the Terms and Conditions of Use for Spotify. The prose of Moby-Dick is dense; it can be unwieldy—Melville’s mouthfuls are too large for our 21st-century mandibles. Some words that people have trouble with: idolator, remonstrances, vicissitudes, magnanimity, portentousness. Also (this one surprises me): leviathan.

With merciful swiftness, it is revealed that I cannot, simply cannot, listen to a succession of persons read from Moby-Dick for 25 hours. It’s an impossibility for me. I’m a modern man with all of the modern vices: inattention, solipsism, wooziness, dopamine addiction, twitching legs, low blood sugar, a persistent interest in going to the bathroom. So I phase in and out of the Marathon. I wander the museum; I wander the night streets of New Bedford, with their hostile glints of ice. At 7:02 p.m., I’m in the Pour Farm Tavern on Purchase Street, brooding over a double Jameson. Out of the jukebox, loaded with 1970s baggage but still moving, in 2026, with a slinking, predatory roll, comes Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold.” The maniac Nugent, essential American, once a hard-rock warlock, now a vaunting Trumpist. Listen to the song: “Road I cruise is a bitch nowww, BAY-BEH! / You know you can’t turn me ’round / And if a house gets in my way, BAY-BEH! / You know I’ll burn it do-own.” Wow. How fucking Ahab is that?

Coming and going as I am, nevertheless, in my blue-whale heart, I remain attached to the collective, to the shared journey, the shared imagining, all of us with our copies of the book, all of us enmeshed in the great and groaning text. At 4:15 a.m. in the museum’s main auditorium, there’s a long-haul-flight vibe, people looking pale and rumpled as we steer toward Chapter 87, one of the most limpidly head-expanding chapters of the book: “The Grand Armada.”

Somewhere around Java, the Pequod hunts its way into an entire shoal of sperm whales: Its boats are lowered, and whereas at the edge of the shoal, the harpooneers set about their bloody and ocean-churning business, Ishmael’s boat finds itself in the supernaturally serene center. Peaceable whales approach; “like household dogs they came snuffling round us.” And in the transparent depths, a vision is disclosed: nursing mother whales.

As human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us.

Incredible prose, somewhere between journalism and science fiction. But a few paragraphs later, Melville falls into his old weakness, his old foible—he starts symbolizing. The violence at the rim of the shoal, the stillness at the center … He can’t help himself. He must go Sir Thomas Browne on our asses: “Even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.”

Is it a weakness, though? Maybe not. Maybe this nonstop back-and-forth, this spiritual reverb, this throb-throb oscillation between the actual and the symbolic, the objective and the imagined, is the heartbeat of Moby-Dick. Are things ever only themselves, or do they always attach to, refer to, other realities? Must all phenomena have meanings upon meanings? Can a whale ever be just a whale? My mind loops out. It’s 5 a.m. What if existence itself (a line from my notes) is a pun on existence? That’s pretty bloody Melvillean, dude. The man sitting in front of me—rugged, with a fine Rockwell Kent profile—tips forward and begins to emit gentle, bleating snores.

With the dawn—streaky and watery over New Bedford—everything accelerates. Now we’re in the final stretch. Now we’re closing in. At 9:30, in the museum’s research library, a group of Melville scholars holds a packed and slightly giddy informal symposium. A young man, confiding to us that this is his first time reading the book, and apologizing for the basic-ness of his question, asks, “Is Melville using Ishmael to, like, satirize the whole white-male epic of obsession and violence?” Beat. Hanging symposial silence—until one of the scholars, as in the Philip Larkin poem, pronounces an enormous “Yes!” and the room erupts into applause.

The final readings are happening upstairs, in the Harbor View Gallery, with livestreams to all parts of the museum. I’m watching in the auditorium, the doors are open to the main hall, and there’s a slight lag in the streaming between the two spaces. So on every phrase you get an echo: “There she blows!” (There she blows …) Talk about Melvillean reverb. Another line of pure Shakespearean verse drifts up: “Great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang.” (Deep pang …)

And who’s this guy reading the last chapter to us, Reader 277? He’s got to be an actor, a TV guy of some sort: He has an actor’s expressive and sympathetic handsomeness, soap-operatic facial symmetry, no bad angles. His name is Steven Weber (of Wings and Chicago Med, I later discover), he takes a deep breath, and then, my God, he tears the roof off the Moby-Dick Marathon. What a performance. The last battle with the white whale, the destruction (spoiler!) of the Pequod. Weber’s Ahab is all Ahab; his Starbuck is perfectly impassioned. “Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!” We are agog. Afterward, briefly interviewed by the museum’s president, Amanda McMullen, Weber is almost overcome. “I’m so moved by this,” he manages. “This book, boy …”

According to the reading’s organizers, more than 3,000 people attended this year’s Moby-Dick Marathon. Prediction: Next year, if the Whaling Museum can handle it, it’ll be 5,000. I don’t want to label this event a node of resistance, but … it kind of is. It’s a radical act. An all-analog mass redreaming of a book. And not just any book—a flawed American gospel. With Moby-Dick itself, I may have my little fancy-pants peeves, but let’s face it: Ahab is Donald Trump, and Ahab is me, and I am you, and Ted Nugent is the Pequod, and the whale is the whale, and the voyage is America. These resonances ring out; they ring out from New Bedford and keep going, traveling west until they roll down the hills of California and sink hissing into the sea.</div>

My business sells on amazon and we routinely get returns from customers where items are stripped of their core parts, someone else&#39;s product, or just the package with the contents missing.  Amazon does not care.  They just ship it back to us and refund the customer.

Iâ(TM)ve gotten the opposite where a supposedly new item was clearly used/broken/incomplete/wrong and when I send it back they give me a hassle for it like itâ(TM)s my fault they shipped me a piece of crap.Supposedly they look at return history of the customer to make decisions, but I think its crap.I do wonder sometimes if the Amazon driver is not the one stealing, and both the customer and seller are getting f***ed.

Meta&#39;s damage to society goes far beyond damaging kids&#39; mental health.  It also spreads disinformation, enables scam artists to defraud people, winks at exposing minors to sexually-explicit chatbots, and this is refelected in a whole list of media stories [skoll.ca] showing how shitty Meta is.

It&#39;s okay to be a violent racist:  It&#39;s the victim&#39;s job to be bulletproof.

This is the Chicago ideology of &quot;corporations are naturally immoral&quot; applied to everything.  In truth, the social contract stopped being &quot;corporations must serve the public good&quot;, 120 years ago.

Strangely, most people believe leaving your door unlocked does not excuse burglary of your home.  Likewise, Facebook/Meta should be forgiven when they willfully abuse people.

Perhaps a better question is &#39;why is it newsworthy?&#39;

All these companies push all sorts of mandatory training.  It&#39;s only vaguely indicative of things they *might* think need to be taken seriously or need to show they care about stuff like legal compliance, harassment, discrimination, privacy, or security.

Hilarious on those trainings that have questions to check your knowledge that boil down to &quot;what bad thing is *technically* ok for you to do?&quot;

Oh, nothing. Everyone loves a mandatory training.Who said mandatory training is to be loved. It&#39;s an essential part of working life. Not something worth putting on Slashdot.Yeah I was enrolled in mandatory CoPilot training too. Whoop de fucking do. We do training for various company tools all the time, some of them turn out to be useless.

I had a similar training recently, and used an AI browser extension to do it for me. It was significantly slower than doing it by hand, but it surprisingly mostly worked, it also used a lot of tokens and &quot;AI&quot; (which leadership seems to aim for).

Everything is something bigger, articles overhype things. Management forced everyone to do mandatory excel training not because they like wasting hours but because they hope efficiency and computer proficiency will cause more work output with less staffing costs. This has literally been the status quo since the invention of the production line.

In management&#39;s view everything will revolutionise the world.In the media&#39;s view everything is unique and newsworthy. ...

Can&#39;t wait until the AI mixes up the Zimbabwe dollar and the U.S. dollar in a transaction...

Just a wild ass guess though, but knowing efficiencies are always driven from the top, this is the primary likelihood.

Nothing. Look, the AI reaper is going to come with the sickle eventually. Citigroup is saying get on board or eventually get off-boarded.

Making the training voluntary is the worst option. They could do nothing and let the raper start swinging. That would be the cleanest. They could make the training mandatory, which they have, and when the time comes it will be about performance or adherence to expected standards. But voluntary training traps them in an unpleasant limbo of refusal, expectation negotiation,

And once it gives you BS data to a seemingly correct input, then you can use that as justification to commit dollarcrime.

I work for a company damn near the same size as Citygroup, and while there definitely wasn&#39;t mandatory training for AI tools, it&#39;s heavily encouraged (as it is in every large business, especially in tech businesses).

Simple coding project, 600 lines of code.   ChatGPT can&#39;t handle it.   Internal support had me open a support ticket directly with OpenAI, and after many many emails back and forth (and easily demonstrating the issue repeatedly) they basically threw their hands up and gave up, saying they just g

I guess we&#39;re less top-down than some peers, at least about this stuff.

But we have a mostly free hand to use LLMs, or not. There has been vague encouragement to experiment with them, and the data security policy of course applies, but otherwise, no mandates or even heavy-handed suggestions.

I think the main use here is as a coding assistant, but engineers are expected to support/talk about/defend the code they check in, and the way we work enforces that.

Genuine question: Would ChatGPT still be useful if you broke up the 600 line project into more bite-sized tasks?

Even the task of breaking up the project into sub-tasks might be considered for ChatGPT. (&quot;We need to write software for xxx. Can you first provide a breakdown of xxx. I want a list of sub-tasks that are reasonably self-contained&quot;).Then each sub-task (presumably less than 600 lines) could be given to ChatGPT to code.

Personally, I have found ChatGPT useful as a

Oh, Citigroup, you absolute trailblazers of the corporate cosmos! Nothing screams &quot;reinvent yourself&quot; quite like forcing 175,000 people to sit through a glorified crash course in typing clever sentences into a chatbot. Truly, the Renaissance has arrived—except instead of Michelangelo sculpting David, we&#39;ve got Bob from accounting learning how to ask AI for a pivot table in 30 minutes flat.

And let&#39;s not forget the memo—because nothing inspires innovation like a sternly worded email reminding you that your future depends on mastering the art of prompt engineering. &quot;Adapt or be replaced,&quot; says Jane Fraser at Davos, presumably while sipping champagne and nodding gravely about how the robots are coming for your job.

Experts breeze through in under 10 minutes, beginners slog for 30—because apparently the difference between mastery and mediocrity is just 20 minutes of corporate e-learning. Meanwhile, Citi proudly reports 6.5 million prompts entered, which is basically the digital equivalent of shouting &quot;Hey Siri&quot; into the void until something useful happens.

And that 70% adoption rate? Bravo! Nothing says success like a majority of employees reluctantly poking at proprietary AI tools while wondering if their &quot;reinvention&quot; will end with them being replaced by the very thing they just trained to use.

If your mandatory AI course is ten minutes long, and your mandatory sexual harassment training is two hours long, you might have a problem.

It&#39;s the same thing when companies are compulsive that users must use the documentation, cite the documentation and then reference the documentation, and add your notes to the documentation, and it has to be in a way someone can completely follow what you did as if they weren&#39;t technical.

So that your time and skills are ensured to add training documentation our company can use to train future employees as a reduced cost. It&#39;s the same strategy with AI. If they want to develop the tool, they need everyone to

Real question: why? I mean, you&#39;re fucking neglecting the browser that the whole organization is supposed to be about but here you are dumping money into shitty AI. So tell me, WHY?!

I wish I had mod points. Bravo, good sir. Bravo.

To hurry up and grab some of that bubble money.

CEO who should not even exist (in multiple senses arguably, but I mean Mozilla shouldn&#39;t have one here) justifying his multi million dollar salary in the usual way - with bullshit.

They have not committed to spending $1.4 billion on an AI initiative.

Rather, the new CEO stated it&#39;s a priority, and that they want to do it by investing in themselves and others. And then the article notes that they have about $1.4 billion in reserves that could go towards investments like that.

They are moving on AI in a way that is a priority, and is a concern for a lot of people that think they should still be mostly focused on the web. But I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve said anything that makes them as all in as this implies.

&quot;While its biggest priority remains growing and investing in Firefox, investing in the rebel alliance is “at the heart of who Mozilla is today,” according to the report on Tuesday. Supporting startups is central to that strategy.&quot;

But the summary, and to some extent the headline and intro to the article, imply they&#39;ve made some all in commitment about AI. But nothing actually says that.

1.4 billion in reserves? Maybe they could fix thunderbird QR codesOr put the option back in place which stops the harassing message you don&#39;t have the latest and greatest version installed.

Or put the option back in place which stops the harassing message you don&#39;t have the latest and greatest version installed.

We all know that &quot;safe&quot; in this context means silencing content that you, personally, disapprove of. How is that compatible with open source, where anyone can fork an &quot;unsafe&quot; version?

Wonder who will end up with the domain name.

Maybe they can hire someone really brilliant to head it up. I nominate Brendan Eich.

Before the whole business model was marketing, profiling and addiction was the time to do subscriptions to prevent enshitification.  There is no going back; it&#39;s so toxic that I doubt it can be composted and produce anything fruitful.

They will take your money, remove the absolute minimum annoyances while promoting some extras to &quot;add value&quot; but retain as much shit as possible; this is about making more money not replacing evil income streams. That is why there is no chance of going back while it&#39;s a publicl

For a while I would use an adblocker on Facebook and I actually would reach the end. However, I think this was because the adblocker would break the page after a while. It was nice.

You&#39;re right, ads are so ingrained into Facebook that I don&#39;t think they can be extricated from the product. People are signing up for the privilege to view ads and have their responses tracked (whether they realize it or not). Facebook is an advertising machine and you are the product. If they can trick someone into paying money for it, even better, but it won&#39;t materially change the system except improve the quality of ads by verifying your identity.

And you will pay for it. Is the tech industry anything other than a massive rent extraction machine?

Marking the value of these companies to market, is that it?  For decades the idea for all of these &#39;businesses&#39; was to collect as many free users as possible (which is why they could get hundreds of thousands if not millions of subscribers per day) and then get paid by the &#39;investors&#39; (gamblers) for this.  Their best business propositions were to sell advertisements and to sell user data.  By introducing paid subscriptions AFAIC they are actually marking the value of their businesses to market, as in they a

Tech giants took huge risks with AI, money&#39;s not coming back, and now they scramble to monetize any last bit of value they have left.

F. B. Purity [fbpurity.com] gives you a reverse-chronological feed and zaps most ads.  Downside is it only works in a browser on the desktop, but then again that&#39;s the only sort-of-safe way to use Facebook. [skoll.ca]

Many people avoid Meta products because of the predatory pricing model.  In that model, &quot;payment&quot; means giving up our privacy and control of our data to advertisers and data brokers.  Instead, offer a model where we pay directly, and give us control of our own data again.

Any other deal is pointless.   Any &quot;premium&quot; service is for their benefit, not ours.

Not only are you the product, you now can PAY to be the product!

A weekly gathering uses Meetup.  Meetup SUCKS, but they layer in all of these appeals to getting a subscription, because ... I guess they we get access to the Prime Suckage?  Like, do they have an entirely different set of engineers and managers running a parallel system which is much more user-centric?

I can&#39;t imagine this will be any better.  Facebook is terrible in so many ways.  I am willing to pay for a YouTube package to get out of YouTube&#39;s ads, but over time I&#39;m gradually realizing that doesn&#39;t solve

Lock AI features behind premium subscription! PLEASE!

I would consider using a fee-based social media platform if:  (1) it never shows me ads; (2) it never shows me content except from people or groups I&#39;ve explicitly chosen to follow; (3) it always presents posts to me in reverse-chronological order; and (4) it does not sell my personal information and does not use my personal information for algorithmic purposes or to drive &quot;engagement&quot;.

I think I&#39;d pay between $3 and $5 (CAD) per month for a decent platform like this if enough of my friends were on it too.

That sounds painful--for me! I finally turned off fingerprint authentication on my phone because, half the time, it couldn&#39;t read *my* fingerprints!

It&#39;s not surprising to me that Apple uses might think the whole world uses iPhones. That&#39;s exactly how the Apple marketing machine has worked to make it feel. The reality is, just over half of smartphone users in the US, use iPhone. Just under half use Android.

I have *never* been tempted to switch from Android to Apple. IMO it&#39;s a worse experience, and way, *way* more expensive. Moto G phones are less than $200 unlocked, and they have plenty of power and features to keep up with the best of them, well, maybe unless you want one of those fancy tri-fold phones.

For me personally, though, my preferred option would be to not have a cell phone. Unfortunately, everything is either an app or needs a fucking app or needs to send you an SMS message for secuiaraiaity (marketing) reasons.

Well, I guess for you, it feels like everyone has smartphones! And on that score, you&#39;d pretty much be right.

I do make use of the SoC on my costly S-series Samsung; it makes an excellent video recorder and monitor while I primarily shoot photos on my Canon mirrorless camera. But Apple brings nothing but restrictions to the table, even to the point that their devices can&#39;t be used for arbitrary file storage and don&#39;t allow third party web browsers. There&#39;s nothing they&#39;re doing that&#39;s worth dealing with the lock-in from having one.

It worked fine for me, until I found myself in a situation where I couldn&#39;t pay the monthly iCloud bill.  Then I had to start offloading app data from my iPhone, despite it having 256GB of storage, and now, my mac, my iPhone and my iPad no longer know what each other has.  If only Apple gave users an option to use - by entering the URL of any cloud storage provider, including one&#39;s own - cloud storages different from Apple&#39;s, it would have been just perfect.

Oh, and there&#39;s also Apple&#39;s delightful habit of

How about putting the airplane mode switch behind the device lock so a thief can&#39;t grab your phone and immediately put it in airplane mode to stop it being tracked?

Standard on Samsung phones, inexplicably not on Google Pixel (I have both).

FaceID is a non starter for me.  Which is why I never upgraded my iPhone SE3.  I do wish that in the newer iPhones - from 10 to 17, they provided the option of a pattern lock, similar to what Android devices have.  Then they wouldn&#39;t have had to worry about the home key, and people like you who don&#39;t want biometric information on their phones can use that instead

The winds shifted this week after America watched Alex Pretti’s on-camera murder, on the heels of Renee Nicole Good’s on-camera murder, at the hands of Department of Homeland Security agents in Minnesota. Signs of cracks in the anti-immigrant right abound, from the alleged ouster of Greg Bovino from his role as “commander at large” of Customs and Border Protection to President Donald Trump’s TACO turn offering up an olive branch to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Republican luminaries who are usually content to deflect, attack, or ritually fellate the president in the wake of acts of lawlessness and violence have taken to the airwaves to condemn these public executions, with protests about them coming from the likes of Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, all of whom are demanding serious systemic changes in Trump’s immigration enforcement rampage. And gun rights groups have increasingly joined the chorus to contend that bringing a lawfully purchased gun out in public cannot be the basis for summary executions at the hands of federal officers. The CEOs of Target and other big corporations based in Minnesota seem to have unearthed something that looks to be a spine, calling for deescalation.

All credit—all of it—goes to the people on the ground in Minnesota; protesters, monitors, neighborhood patrols, independent journalists. As Robert F. Worth noted in the Atlantic, for all the MAGA talk of “domestic terrorists” and woke “assassins,” what’s emerged on the streets of Minneapolis is an organic, homegrown “meticulous urban choreography of civic protest,” a movement that is “leaderless” and “hyperlocal.” It has proven indomitable in the face of cosplay and photo ops and cartoon characters like Bovino and Kristi Noem. As Sherrilyn Ifill points out: “We all owe a debt of gratitude to the resilient and principled stance of the people of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota who have remained undeterred. They have fought for their neighbors and for themselves. They have stood in proud defense of their city, and their right to peacefully protest. The organizers on the ground have been extraordinary.” Adam Serwer calls it simply “neighborism.”

It’s going to be tempting to say that this week in Minnesota is the beginning of the end of something, but more likely it’s the beginning of something worse. Bovino and Noem in retreat is not the same as Trump and Stephen Miller in retreat, and there is genuine reason to fear that this moment of so-called symbolic compliance—a fleeting, symbolic retreat to stymy growing public resistance—will slow the roll of congressional inquiries, impeachment efforts directed at Noem, general strikes, and calls to defund ICE. Moreover, as Attorney General Pam Bondi’s not-so-subtle effort to extort voter information from Minnesota’s governor reveals, this cruel deportation dragnet is only half of the story; as ever, effort to undermine future elections is the goal. For every strategic Trump flinch and retreat, you can expect an equal and opposite effort to remain in power forever. With every threat of impeachment and accountability, the incentive to ensure a permanent MAGA majority forever ticks up, invisibly, but assuredly.

Which is why it is a mistake to think of these twin tragedies in Minneapolis as the horrific government actions that finally prompted shifts in politics, or law. Too much attention is always directed at opinion polling, craven political actors, and the levers of political change, and doubly so during this second Trump administration. This tendency to witness everything through the lens of “when will this be over for good” distracts from the real meaning of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, which is not how they died, but what they were doing when they were killed. This is what changed on the ground in Minnesota, and what needs to happen in Philadelphia and in Maine and in whatever blue city or state becomes the next target and the target after that. This transcends even the conversations about flipping the House in November. This is about what we are now learning, under immense pressure, and in real time, about authoritarian takeovers and how to resist.

For years we were told that voters didn’t care about protecting the Constitution or democracy, and they certainly didn’t vote on it. And certainly that appeared to be true in 2016 and again in 2024. But what we have seen spring up on the streets of Los Angeles and Portland and Minneapolis, and what we saw in the earliest No Kings marches, is that Americans actually care deeply about the law and the Constitution and democracy, and also—to borrow from testimony from Jack Smith last week—that those things have functioned so well in the United States and for so very long that many of us had come to take it for granted. For the last 15 years at least, after Citizens United, and Shelby County, and Dobbs, when audiences at speeches would ask me “What should I be doing?,” my responses tended to be carefully lawyerly and bloodless: court reform, gerrymandering reform, campaign finance reform. Repair and protect democracy and we could perhaps claw back its original sins as well as its distortions and degradations.

Well, it turns out it’s actually much more basic than that. What we are seeing amid the street protests, and the meal deliveries, and the marches and the legal observers and the calls for a general strike and for defunding DHS and impeachment for criminals, is actually all democracy work, and constitutional work, transmogrified and embodied into American streets and schools and small businesses. I was struck and moved by Robert Worth’s observation about what he witnessed in Minnesota: “Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution.” And if this is, in fact, the call, then what it might look like to answer it is no longer inchoate or mysterious. People are fighting and being assaulted and even murdered on their streets for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the 14th Amendment … This is a clawing back of the Constitution, amendment by amendment, on the streets, and by the people.

Those of us who believed ourselves to be part of the Trump Resistance in 2016 made the mistake of naming it without quite knowing what it was. Pink hats and marches that felt like street fairs and witty signs were for social media. This version of the resistance swallows that whole—law enforcement officials want to shoot you, and you will be pepper-sprayed while you are restrained on the ground. As DHS efforts to occupy and terrorize cities morph and expand, this won’t be “protest” as we once understood it; it will be something far more frightening, something familiar to historians of racialized policing. Yes, it requires, even demands, new rules of engagement. Legal and civil disobedience training are now essential, and there will be ample work to do in protecting vulnerable neighbors and neighborhoods. It turns out that it was only hard to articulate what needed to be done to protect democracy and the Constitution until it needed doing. And now that we know what democracy emphatically does not look like—tyrannical cruelty as part of an all-out demand for mass submission to authority and the subordination of the “other”—it has, overnight, become simpler to name and understand the mission.

This is why the most dangerous days are almost certainly ahead, but it helps to know that the courts, and most of the lawyers, and the blue-city mayors and the blue-state attorneys general and the neighbors and the teachers and the religious leaders, already know in their bones which side they are on. Democracy will not defend itself, in much the same way that authoritarianism will not just pick up its nasty toys of wars and go home. There is a massive shift taking place that has to do with resisting state executions of lawful protesters but also has as much to do with fighting for the core values laid out by the same imperfect streetfighters who founded the country. It is indeed the stuff of nightmares, but this is what democracy must look like.

Now we can name the mission, which is no small thing. Focus on the mission and ignore spectacle and spin. Of the many, many things that Trump and MAGA have misunderstood, almost foremost among them was the belief that Americans would forever be more interested in consuming white-supremacist online content than in creating actual democratic freedom. From Chicago to Portland to Minneapolis to your town, when someone asks you what they should be doing, the answer must be: Protecting the Constitution.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents have now killed two U.S. citizens in Minnesota under the made-up banner of “absolute immunity” for federal law enforcement officials, regardless of what they do or how they do it. The notion of immunity for state actors in American law goes back decades, and much of what we are seeing on the ground now in terms of violent immigration enforcement has its antecedents in long-standing and deeply flawed American ideas about good guys versus bad guys and who bears the burden of law enforcement run amok. On this week’s Amicus podcast, as the nation struggles to process the executions of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation and Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: ICE agents, like all federal agents, are protected by qualified immunity, and that protects them from lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of duty. And we’ve had that for a long time. Help us understand this foundational idea that for the most part, law enforcement officers cannot be held liable for their actions when they violate your rights. How did we get here?

Alex Reinert: Really, there are two foundational ideas in play in these cases involving federal officials. One is what I’m about to talk about, which is qualified immunity, and a second is something called Bivens doctrine, which is a common law doctrine that used to allow people to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. Let’s start with qualified immunity, which is not long-standing in the sense that it’s really a modern introduction to the law of constitutional torts. It was introduced by the Supreme Court in 1967 in the context of a Freedom Riders case. That was the context in which a lawsuit was brought against state and local officials, and the Supreme Court basically said: We think, even though Congress didn’t spell it out in detail in a statute that gave you the right to sue these officials, and even though Congress didn’t say anything about an immunity doctrine, we think this common law doctrine that may have existed in 1871 should be incorporated into our constitutional tort regime. Fast-forward to 1982, which is where we got a case called Harlow v. Fitzgerald. In that case the Supreme Court said: We also think there should be an immunity doctrine that applies to federal officials.

What it means in practice is that any officer—whether state, local, or federal—who violates the Constitution won’t be held liable unless there is some prior case that makes it clear, from a court’s perspective, that the officer’s conduct was obviously a violation of the Constitution.

So qualified immunity is only really used, or it really only has an impact, when an officer is violating the Constitution. If officers don’t violate the Constitution, they don’t need the protection of qualified immunity. It’s only when officers violate the Constitution that they are able to obtain the protection of qualified immunity.

On its face, if you explained it to somebody and said that we should only hold officers liable when they were on reasonable notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct, people might look at it and think that makes sense. In practice, it has been applied in the widest range of circumstances where most people would say: How is it possible? How is it possible that somebody could get immunity when, for instance, they’re ordered by their supervisor not to fire a shot and they fire six shots and kill someone? When they are executing a search warrant and they decide to steal about $200,000 worth of valuables and a court says, Well, there’s qualified immunity because there wasn’t a prior case in point saying that when you’re executing a search warrant, you can’t steal money? Those are the kinds of cases in which qualified immunity comes into play.

It’s probably shocking to the ordinary person that in this country, a country purported to be governed by the rule of law, and where the Constitution is thought of as foundational, it turns out that violations of the Constitution by our highest-level officers and officials aren’t remediable because of this doctrine of qualified immunity.

Explain Bivens doctrine now, to set the table for what follows.

This is the other part of what is a perverse design of our constitutional scheme. Bivens is special because it applies only to federal officials. When state and local officials violate our rights, there’s a statute that goes all the way back to Reconstruction enacted in 1871 that allows us to sue state and local officials for violations of our constitutional rights. Qualified immunity still applies, but at least there’s a right to sue. There is no similar statute when federal officials violate the Constitution.

In 1971, in a case by the name of Bivens, the Supreme Court said: We think that we are going to find a right to sue in the Fourth Amendment, for Fourth Amendment violations when federal officials violate someone’s rights. Over the course of the next 10 years, the Supreme Court expanded that doctrine to include Eighth Amendment violations, and claims for sex discrimination. During the 1970s, lower courts were also rapidly expanding the Bivens doctrine.

All that changed in 1980. From 1980 on, the Supreme Court said: We are not going to entertain Bivens actions. And the court has given us a variety of reasons to the point where today, when the Supreme Court hears a Bivens claim, it basically says: We’re not sure that this court would even recognize the right to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. We’re certainly not going to extend that right to sue beyond the narrow category of the three cases in which the Bivens right was recognized in the 1970s. Furthermore, we’re going to confine those categories very narrowly.

I come back to this principle that we have a Constitution that is supposed to be meaningful in this country and it’s supposed to govern the conduct of all of our officers. It’s perverse that we have a federal Constitution that means less for federal officials than it does for state and local officials. We have a federal Constitution that is harder to enforce against federal officials than almost anyone else. That’s really a product of the Bivens doctrine.

And the last piece of this that I think is really important, just historically, for people to understand is that this wasn’t the model of remediation we had in the 19th century. You could sue federal officers in the 19th century when they violated your rights. It was not a unique occurrence. It was accepted that this was a way for people to obtain remedies. It also was accepted that it was a way to test the legality of executive conduct, of the policies and conduct of federal officials. Now we live in this world in which there are so many barriers to that kind of accountability, to those tests for legality.

That’s just a bad way to design courts. We want to learn from our mistakes. We want law to be able to develop if it should. It’s also bad, obviously, for people who are bringing these kinds of claims. I also think  it’s bad for policing. We want police to do their job consistent with the Constitution. Having answers to the question of when they violate rights and when they don’t should be, and is, important to them. So we’re losing all these opportunities in these cases to develop the law in ways that I think should help everyone.

Last week the AP reported a whistleblower complaint that showed that in violation of long-standing Fourth Amendment principles, ICE is taking the position that they can just enter folks’ homes without a judicial warrant. They can just use an administrative warrant. The whistleblower complaint alleges that the secret memo outlining this policy, signed by acting deputy ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, “although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the INA, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

I think it is extremely concerning and also an untenable interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court hasn’t addressed this question, but the whole premise of the warrant requirement is that there should be some independent adjudicator—someone outside the executive branch—to decide whether or not there is a justification for invading the sanctity of someone’s home. Administrative warrants don’t provide that; judicial warrants do. That doesn’t mean judicial warrants are perfect, but they are at least outside the executive branch. It’s important from a separation-of-powers perspective, of course, and it’s important from an institutional design perspective. We already have so much about the immigration system over which the executive has so much authority: the appointment of immigration judges, all of these policy memos. So to fold the power to issue warrants, and act on warrants, into the executive in this way is just an extreme power grab. And the line about use of force gets us back to what we were talking about with Bivens and qualified immunity, which is when the officers use force in those circumstances, when they go overboard in their use of force—as inevitably some will—what kinds of remedies will there be? Those will be few and far between.

It reminds me of Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, where he says, essentially, People are talking about use of force, but this case isn’t about use of force. If there is a use of force, then people should be able to go to court and sue. He says all that in his concurrence, but at the same time we know that Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who has led the charge for undermining the Bivens remedy. It’s exactly what the Supreme Court does in so many contexts in the civil rights world. They’ll say: We’re not going to give you this remedy here, but don’t worry. There’s all these other ways you can enforce your rights. And then when they’re over there in the other box, they say: Well, we’re not going to allow you to enforce your rights here because there’s something else over here. Pam Karlan calls it a shell game and it works like this: When I’m over here, I’m going to say, Don’t worry about me limiting your rights because there’s some other way for you to enforce them. And then I’m just going to undermine your means of enforcing them in that other part of the jurisprudence. So it is troubling to the extreme that ICE officers are going to be acting on this authority.

Since 2020, and the murder of George Floyd and the flash of recognition that police reform was past due, there has been a significant public silence. As a consequence, in that silence, we have to grapple with that which makes us very uncomfortable. By “we” I mean a culture that has turned a blind eye to a lot of these issues and is suddenly startled by the ways police immunity and impunity have been weaponized for immigration enforcement. So help us think through reform in ways that are conducive to meaningful accountability and conducive to having a civic life that doesn’t include masked officers pepper-spraying or shooting somebody who’s already restrained on the ground. How do we think in a bigger, more generous way about getting to where we want to be?

I guess I would think about it in at least two different ways. The first is part of the reason there’s resistance to increasing accountability, particularly for our policing apparatus. It has to do with the sense that it’s a hard job. And it’s a job that at some level, most people think we need people to do. And what do we do when something that people see as really important, that’s also hard, what do we do when that imposes costs? When that imposes costs on people who did nothing wrong, who are left traumatized, maybe dead, seriously injured? I’ve always thought that the problem with a lot of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is it leaves those costs on the people who suffered them. It leaves those costs directly on the people who suffered them. But if we allow it, if we think there’s something good that comes out of policing, if we think it creates some value for the public at large, why should the costs be borne solely by the people who suffered most significantly as a result of it? So that’s one piece of it that always resonates with me about why some of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is so wrong.

For a while, or at least for I don’t know how long of a moment after the murder of George Floyd, there was a conversation. I would go to demonstrations and I’d see signs that said “End qualified immunity.” There was a way in which the doctrine that previously mostly lawyers knew about or scholars were talking about and mostly other people didn’t know about, that doctrine came into the public consciousness and became important. I think there is still some of that going on. I think there is still some momentum for that.

When we think about accountability, we usually think about accountability for an individual, an individual who behaved in some unlawful way. It makes sense to think about accountability that way. But the problems we’re talking about are systemic. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some individuals, the so-called bad apples, who no matter what kind of training we have, no matter what way we approach hiring, no matter what kind of supervision we provide, there are some people who may just act egregiously because they can, because they have a badge. But I think for the most part, the problems we’re talking about are systemic. And if the problems are systemic, then talking about accountability for individuals isn’t necessarily the right frame. I think we need to approach solutions to the problem systemically. And those solutions are as much about: Who ends up paying the damages for the people who suffer? Should it be the individual officer or should it be the departments that employ them? As a matter of practice, it’s always the departments who employ them. So we need to find a way for those agencies to learn better from the kinds of misconduct that their officers enter into. But it’s also about the legal regime that we set up to allow people to sue and what kinds of things they sue for, the way we allow people, really limit the ability of people, to bring so-called injunctive relief and systemic reform of departments.

So if we think about accountability more broadly, and we think about the problems we’ve been talking about, through a systemic lens, it’s not so much about the individual officer. It’s about creating a legal regime that allows us to get answers to the questions of how people were mistreated, whether the way in which they were mistreated was unlawful, and making sure that we can build systems so that it doesn’t keep happening. Because right now we’re in a world where it is happening over and over again and it seems like there are very few tools in our toolbox to prevent the reoccurrence.

Early Saturday morning, it appeared as if enough Senate Democrats were willing to fund the Department of Homeland Security and its deportation machine, if that’s what it took to keep the rest of the government open.

The House had passed funding for the DHS late last week, with seven centrist Democrats joining nearly all Republicans to get it over the line. The Senate was to take it up this week alongside a handful of other funding bills. It was expected that, as with the House vote, enough Democrats would hold their noses and support it, even if it meant absorbing blowback from a furious Democratic base that has been dusting off the largely dormant “Abolish ICE” slogan. Democratic negotiators felt that approving full-year, carefully negotiated spending bills and reasserting Congress’ power of the purse over a freewheeling executive branch was the priority of the moment.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement last Tuesday, once the deal was released. She listed some pittances she had secured in the DHS bill, such as more money for body cameras for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. She knew, though, that wouldn’t ease any anger within the base. Ultimately, she leveled.

“But the hard truth,” she added, “is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”

All of this changed on Saturday in Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents killed 37-year-old observer Alex Pretti. All of this changed when videos showed Pretti subdued, being pepper-sprayed and then shot, over and over again, without brandishing the firearm that he was permitted to carry. All of this changed when, as after the killing of Renee Good, White House adviser Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem absurdly described Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” or “assassin.” After Pretti’s killing and the administration’s eyesight-defying remorselessness over what happened, there was no way Senate Democrats could put their fingerprints on a bill to fund the administration’s deportation machine.

“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” Patty Murray said Saturday.

She was hardly the only one. Democrats who’ve previously broken from the pack to join Republicans in advancing government funding bills, like Sens. Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, Angus King, and Jacky Rosen, all said the same. On the House side, meanwhile, one Democrat who had voted for the DHS funding bill, New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, offered a mea culpa on social media, saying that he had “long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put a bow on Democrats’ new posture Saturday night: Democrats would filibuster DHS funding without changes. And it didn’t sound like there was much handwringing about it.

Does this make a partial government shutdown, after funding lapses after Jan. 30, inevitable? Let’s say much more likely. The situation is complicated for reasons including, but not limited to, the weather.

The funding bill the Senate will be voting on does not just cover DHS. It combines half a dozen bills that the House has passed in January funding everything from the Pentagon to the State Department to the departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Labor, and more. Although this package includes only half of the 12 yearly appropriations bills, the specific departments it includes—especially Defense and HHS—comprise a comfortable majority of annual spending.

Senate Democrats are calling on their Republican counterparts, in Schumer’s words, to “work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.” In other words, to strip DHS funding from the package, pass everything else, and then allow for more time to negotiate the DHS budget.

Would Republicans be willing to do this? They typically don’t take orders from Democrats. But Republican leaders, just as much as Democratic ones, don’t want appropriators’ delicate work on the biggest funding bills to get sent to an incinerator of fury. The New York Times reported Saturday that “recognizing the depth of Democratic rage,” Senate Republicans “immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said her committee was “exploring all options.”

If—if—leaders in the Senate reach an agreement to amend the package, then there’s another problem: The House is on recess this week, and House Republicans’ leaders wouldn’t be particularly enthused about summoning members to Washington to revote on a package amended at Democrats’ request. Plus, a substantial portion of the continental United States is buried under a sheet of ice and snow, conditions that aren’t conducive to travel.

It’s important to note that a lapse in DHS funding wouldn’t impede deportation operations much. As Patty Murray repeatedly said when she was trying to push the deal through, ICE is sitting on substantial funds that were made available to it in Republicans’ party-line megabill last year.

Murray is still saying that, posting on Sunday that “Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE. ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap, whether or not we pass a funding bill.”

“But,” she added, “we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight.” They’re not about to bless it with their votes.

On Saturday, Alex Pretti was pushed to the ground and fatally shot by federal agents. Video shows that, moments before, Pretti was holding a cellphone in one hand and had his other hand up. Pretti was 37 and worked as an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. He enjoyed biking and had a dog named Joule.

Later that day, What Next’s Mary Harris spoke to Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague and friend of Pretti’s, who remembers him as “a kind guy” who modeled cooperation and who, right out of school, took one of the hardest jobs available to nurses. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How did you learn about what happened?

Dimitri Drekonja: We were at [my son’s ski] race in the morning, and one of the other parents said, “Did you hear there was another shooting?” It sort of filtered through: “It sounds like another shooting.” “Another person died.” And there was a lot of sort of like, “This is just heavy.” “Awful.”

And then we got back from the race, and on a group chat, someone said, “ICE executed Alex Pretti.” [Editor’s note: It later became clear that the officers were with Customs and Border Protection.] It was from our group that we had had when we had first hired him to be study staff on our research project. It was like, What? You have to be kidding me.

I had seen one of the videos. [In it,] you can’t see the defined definitions of someone’s face and recognize them. But once the name was out there and I saw the build, the facial hair, it’s like, Oh, shit, that was Alex.

People have asked, “Are you surprised that he was protesting?” And, in all honesty, no one can be surprised that anyone in Minneapolis is protesting. We see 80-year-olds out protesting. We see kids out protesting. The city is pretty, pretty pissed off about what is happening, and people are out there doing their civic duty of being out there peacefully protesting.

Have you been able to watch the videos? I can’t stop myself watching the videos.

I don’t know how you watch someone you know—

I have not sought them out. I mean, my wife has shown me some, like, “Oh, God, with this new view you can see …” I’ve seen a few that way. It’s awful.

You posted on social media that you were feeling white-hot rage. What do you do with that feeling in this moment?

Right now, delay going to dinner with friends because I don’t feel terribly sociable. I’ve been really appreciative of people who have been reaching out to say, “Hey, sorry to hear—sounds like Alex was a great guy. This is hard.”

I think other people are enraged. I think the worst thing right now would be to have random violence. I’ve been really proud of Minneapolis—the scope and scale of the protests, the fact that they have been peaceful.

The administration has said your friend must have been trying to kill officers. Is there something you want to tell people who may have that belief about Alex?

The thing that I would say is that I have known Alex for years. I’ve known him to be a kind guy, a guy quick with a laugh, a joke, willing to help. He has never shared a conspiracy theory or shared anger at a group or been unpatriotic. I mean, he is the kind of guy that you would want as your neighbor and your friend. I would be thrilled if he were to move into the house next door.

We have a shared interest in mountain biking. We were planning on going out together. I was always the one who was having to say, “No, sorry, my kid has a race this week. Can’t do it.” But we liked the same trail systems, and we talked about riding them.

I have observed him clinically. He is fabulous, he gives great assessments, he’s enthusiastic, he is smart, and I will just say that anybody going into the ICU fresh out of nursing school—you’re gonna deal with very sick patients. A [large] percent of the patients in the ICU will die, and you’ll have to deal with grieving, upset families. You’ll have to use all your skills to try to keep that person alive. To do that right out of nursing school is impressive.

Sometimes medicine is a hierarchical place. He was not like that, and I loved that. I would run into him, and he would say, “Hey, Dimitri, how’s it going? It’s good to see you again.” I love that he had that informal relationship. I love it was modeled for trainees who worked with us. Like, yeah, this is how you do it: You’re colleagues, you’re friendly, you are nice to each other, and you work well together.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/whatsapp_strict_account_settings_meta_rust/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Users of Meta&#39;s WhatsApp messenger looking to simplify the process of protecting themselves are in luck, as the company is rolling out a new feature that combines multiple security settings under a single, toggleable option.

Strict Account Settings is what Meta is calling the new lockdown mode built into its WhatsApp encrypted-by-default messenger. Found under the Settings > Privacy > Advanced menu in the iOS and Android versions of WhatsApp, Strict Account Settings will limit a good deal of app functionality in the name of better security.

Users are made more invisible by restricting last seen and online status, profile photos and account details to contacts and other select users; who can add them to groups is limited; link previews are disabled; high-volume messages from unknown accounts are blocked; security code change notifications are turned on; and two-step verification is enabled by default on the account.

Individual features of Strict Account Settings can be toggled off without disabling the rest, a Meta spokesperson told The Register.

Due to its reputation as a secure messaging platform, WhatsApp attracts a number of high-profile individuals who are at risk for phishing attacks, malware embedded in attachments, and the like. Meta explained the new feature as a way to protect such users, but the feature won&#39;t be restricted to certain accounts.

&quot;We will always defend that right to privacy for everyone … but a few of our users – like journalists or public-facing figures – may need extreme safeguards against rare and highly-sophisticated cyber attacks,&quot; Meta explained. Strict Account Settings are rolling out to all users in the coming weeks, the company said in its announcement.

When asked if this announcement was in any way tied to a lawsuit filed last week in a San Francisco federal court alleging that WhatsApp&#39;s end-to-end encryption is misleading and that Meta employees can access users&#39; messages, the company said that the two were not connected and called the lawsuit frivolous.

&quot;Any claim that people&#39;s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told The Register. &quot;WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction and we will pursue sanctions against plaintiffs&#39; counsel.&quot;

Meta also on Tuesday announced it had replaced an older C++-written media processing and security library with one built in Rust, which it said is smaller, safer, and easier to maintain, and a sign that “Rust is production ready at a global scale.”

The new Rust library is used in WhatsApp’s handling of media files and other document types, performing format validation and consistency checks designed to reduce the risk of maliciously crafted files. Like Microsoft, Meta said it&#39;s so thrilled with Rust&#39;s security capabilities that it plans to accelerate its adoption of the language in the coming years. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/ice_data_advertising_tech_firms/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s not enough to have its agents in streets and schools; ICE now wants to see what data online ads already collect about you. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week issued a Request for Information (RFI) asking data and ad tech brokers how they could help in its mission.

The RFI is not a solicitation for bids. Rather it represents an attempt to conduct market research into the spectrum of data – personal, financial, location, health, and so on – that ICE investigators can source from technology and advertising companies.

&quot;[T]he Government is seeking to understand the current state of Ad Tech compliant and location data services available to federal investigative and operational entities, considering regulatory constraints and privacy expectations of support investigations activities,&quot; the RFI explains.

Issued on Friday, January 23, 2026, one day prior to the shooting of VA nurse Alex Pretti by a federal immigration agent, two weeks after the shooting of Renée Good, and three weeks after the shooting of Keith Porter Jr, the RFI lands amid growing disapproval of ICE tactics and mounting pressure to withhold funding for the agency.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request to elaborate on how it might use ad tech data and to share whether any companies have responded to its invitation.

The RFI follows a similar solicitation published last October for a contractor capable of providing ICE with open source intelligence and social media information to assist the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) directorate&#39;s Targeting Operations Division – tasked with finding and removing &quot;aliens that pose a threat to public safety or national security.&quot;

The October 2025 RFI observes that a new approach is needed because enforcement actions undertaken without open source intelligence and social media info often fail.

&quot;Previous approaches to targeting individuals for enforcement action which have not incorporated open web sources and social media information have had limited success,&quot; the RFI-Performance Work Statement says. &quot;The individuals targeted for enforcement action purposely employ countermeasures to inhibit ICE-ERO&#39;s ability to locate them.&quot;

Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Register in a phone interview that the RFI represents &quot;a preview of what&#39;s to come. We know they&#39;ve used a lot of this technology in the past, but what they&#39;re trying to do is get a clearer state of the current environment for this technology.&quot;

Maass said it&#39;s not obvious which companies will respond to the inquiry. &quot;It might not be the big companies you think of. It might be smaller consultancies. It might be resellers.&quot;

He added that the information being sought is vague. The main focus, he expects, is location data from vendors like Venntel. But it could come from other sources, he said, like Thomson Reuters or Transunion&#39;s TLOxp.

Tom Bowman, policy counsel with the Center for Democracy & Technology&#39;s (CDT) Security & Surveillance Project, told The Register in a phone interview that ICE is attempting to rebrand surveillance as a commercial transaction.

&quot;But that doesn&#39;t make the surveillance any less intrusive or any less constitutionally suspect,&quot; said Bowman. &quot;This inquiry specifically underscores what really is a long-standing problem – that government agencies have been able to sidestep Fourth Amendment protections by purchasing data that would otherwise need a warrant to collect.&quot;

The data derived from ad tech and various technology businesses, said Bowman, can reveal intimate details about people&#39;s lives, including visits to medical facilities and places of worship.

&quot;Treating this data as merely commercially available is an end run around constitutional safeguards that erodes public trust,&quot; he said.

Bowman said that while he expects DHS would justify its interest in this information by claiming it would make investigations more efficient, or that the information is already legally available, or that data providers abide by privacy rules, &quot;administrative convenience has never been a valid excuse for bypassing civil liberties.&quot;

Nor, he said, is paper compliance a cure for the abusive data pipeline.

&quot;Ad tech compliance regimes were never designed to protect people from government surveillance or coercive enforcement,&quot; he said. &quot;Ad tech data is often collected via consent that is meaningless. The data flows are opaque. And then these types of downstream uses are really difficult to control.&quot;

Bowman argues that while there&#39;s been a broad failure to meaningfully regulate data brokers, legislative solutions are possible.

&quot;Legislative solutions like the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act would severely curb this type of shady surveillance behavior in which the government is able to rebrand surveillance via commercial transaction to sidestep the Fourth Amendment,&quot; he said.

Maass said the EFF also supports legislation like the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act. And he said that there are technical measures people can take to defend themselves, like disabling your advertising identifier on your phone and not sharing your location with apps that don&#39;t need it.

But, he said, it has become harder to understand all the ways one can leak location data, pointing to the data gathering that occurs in modern cars.

Nick Doty, senior technologist at the CDT, also said individuals can take steps to reduce their data footprint by doing things like blocking cross-context tracking and withholding permission for location tracking in apps. He added that operating system vendors, browser makers, and ad tech companies could limit harmful tracking if they were incentivized to do so.

&quot;If they want to protect users, I think there are also ways they could design [their products] that would enable efficient and effective advertising that didn&#39;t require unique identifiers everywhere that you went,&quot; Doty said.

We note that Google spent many years designing its failed &quot;Privacy Sandbox&quot; to limit the availability of data to advertisers, only to be out-lobbied by ad tech competitors who feared being put at a data disadvantage and preferred the status quo. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The mobile app emperors have no clothes. Apple and Google have made millions of dollars from AI apps that let users undress people even as both companies claim to ban such software from their stores, according to a new study.

Researchers with the nonprofit Tech Transparency Project found 55 such apps in Google’s Play store and 47 in Apple’s App Store. All told, those apps were downloaded 705 million times and have generated $117 million in revenue, they say. The group published its research on Tuesday in the wake of global outrage over users employed Elon Musk’s AI bot, Grok, to strip people of their clothing. Regulators in the UK have weighed banning the app.

“Grok is really the tip of the iceberg,” Katie Paul, director of Tech Transparency Project, told The Register. “The posts were happening on X so the world could see them. But even more graphic content can be created by some of these other apps which is what really got us into this issue.”

In response to The Register&#39;s inquiry, Google said while its investigation is ongoing, it has removed several apps.

&quot;When violations of our policies are reported to us, we investigate and take appropriate action,&quot; a Google spokesperson said via email. &quot;Most of the apps referenced in this report have been suspended from Google Play for violations of our policies.&quot;

Apple did not reply to an email from The Register seeking comment. According to the investigation, Apple also had sponsored ads, another revenue generator, when users searched for items that should have been banned under its policy, Paul said.

&quot;When you search the word &#39;nudify&#39; in the App Store, according to their policy, nothing should come up, but not only does Grok come up first, Apple had a sponsored ad for a nudify app,&quot; she said. “That app is one of those that they removed after we reached out. Not only was the app on the App Store, Apple was profiting from ads to promote it when people searched the word &#39;nudify.&#39;&quot;

The Tech Transparency Project tested the free versions of the apps using a clothed AI-generated model, then prompted the apps to render the woman completely or partially nude. With the face-swap apps, TTP tested whether the app would superimpose the face of a fully-clothed woman onto an image of a nude woman. In both cases, they were successful, showing how easy it is to create non-consensual intimate imagery.

The apps were all available as of Jan. 21. However, Apple removed 25 of those apps after the researchers contacted them. Google has suspended several, and said it was mounting a review of the apps that were in its store, Paul said.

This latest report from Tech Transparency Project comes about a month after it found both companies&#39; app marketplaces selling apps developed by entities that were sanctioned by the U.S. government because of their ties to the war in the Ukraine and human rights abuses in China.

In that case, the nonprofit found 52 apps in Apple’s App Store with direct connections to Russian, Chinese, and other companies that are under economic sanctions enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department. All of the apps listed a developer, seller, copyright holder, or other information on their App Store page that matched with a U.S.-sanctioned entity.

That earlier investigation found that the Google Play Store had a similar problem, with 18 apps connected to U.S.-sanctioned organizations, roughly a third of the number identified in the Apple App Store.

Paul said that, after that investigation published in December, both companies pulled the apps and posted jobs for compliance officers to review apps for sanctions.

What’s concerning to Paul is what it means for consumers if Google and Apple are willing to brazenly flout laws that can land them in economic trouble with their home governments.

“That was sanctions. That was an area where there are legal consequences. You can imagine the other harmful apps that are out there where there aren’t legal consequences,” Paul said. “With the nudify apps, we found a lot of concerning issues with both app stores. What’s really concerning is that some of these apps were marketed for children ages 9 and up. These aren’t just being marketed to adults, but they’re are also being pushed to kids.”

Another concern: data privacy laws in China that require companies to hand over data to that government.

“When it comes to nudify apps, that means these non-consensual nude images of American citizens would be in the hands of the Chinese government,” Paul said. “So that’s a major privacy violation on top of being a national security risk, particularly if there are political figures who have non consensual nude imagery created of them and then that gets into the hands of the Chinese government.”

Paul said the breakdown appears to lay between policy and moderation. While the policies clearly state these apps are not allowed, in practice they are proliferating.

“We live in a world where we can’t disconnect from this technology,” she told The Register. “These companies market themselves on how safe and trustworthy their app stores are. If you go into their app development pages, they claim to have very stringent review processes – including screening for sanctions – but we don’t see that being applied.” ®

            <div id="article-text">ShinyHunters says it stole several slices of data from Panera Bread, but that&#39;s just the yeast of everyone&#39;s problems. The extortionist gang also claims to have stolen data from CarMax and Edmunds, in addition to three other organizations it posted to its blog last week.

The criminals&#39; claims, seen by The Register and also shared on Daily Dark Web, allege that they stole more than 14 million records from casual bakery-cafe chain Panera Bread, including names, email and home addresses, phone numbers and account details totaling 760 MB of compressed data. They allegedly stole similar types of personally identifiable information (PII) from used-car-buying platform CarMax (over 500,000 records totaling 1.7 GB compressed), and vehicle-review site Edmunds (&quot;millions&quot; of records totaling 12 GB compressed).

None of the three companies immediately responded to The Register&#39;s inquiries.

ShinyHunters told us that it gained access to Panera via a Microsoft Entra single-sign-on (SSO) code, while the CarMax and Edmunds breaches were from earlier, unrelated intrusions.

Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which has ties to ShinyHunters, posted CarMax on its now-defunct data-leak site in the fall, and at the time said it was among the dozens of companies&#39; Salesforce environments it had compromised.

Last week, Okta warned about cybercriminals stealing Okta, Microsoft, and Google SSO codes in a new rash of voice-phishing campaigns. A Microsoft spokesperson told The Register that Redmond &quot;does not have anything to share at this time.&quot; And a Google spokesperson said: &quot;At this time, we have no indication that Google itself or its products are affected by this campaign.&quot;

The new alleged data breach victims join ShinyHunters&#39; claimed intrusions posted last week: Crunchbase, SoundCloud, and Betterment. According to the crime crew&#39;s Friday blog post, these three earlier file-stealing operations netted the crooks more than 50 million records total. ShinyHunters told The Register that it gained access to two of the three - Crunchbase and Betterment - by voice-phishing Okta single-sign-on codes.

This combines social-engineering phone calls with real-time phishing kits. The attacker typically impersonates IT support to trick employees into entering their credentials on a fake website that looks like the real Okta login page, allowing the attacker to steal passwords and bypass users&#39; multi-factor authentication (MFA) in real time.

While neither Crunchbase nor Betterment responded to The Register&#39;s requests for comment, earlier this month, Betterment said an &quot;unauthorized individual&quot; gained access to &quot;certain Betterment systems through social engineering&quot; on January 9.

&quot;The unauthorized access involved third-party software platforms that Betterment uses to support our marketing and operations,&quot; the fintech firm said in a January 12 security update. &quot;Once they gained access, the unauthorized individual was able to send a fraudulent, crypto-related message that appeared to come from Betterment to a subset of our customers.&quot;

Hudson Rock co-founder and CTO Alon Gal last week said he downloaded the Crunchbase leak and it showed PII, signed contracts, and other corporate data.

On Monday, Silent Push threat hunters said ShinyHunters&#39; latest credential-stealing campaign targeted around 100 organizations, and the researchers also published a list of companies across which they have &quot;detected active targeting or infrastructure preparation directed at your domain&quot; in the last 30 days.

&quot;We have no intel to share on any specific attacks and are unable to confirm if any have been successful,&quot; Silent Push senior threat researcher Zach Edwards told The Register on Monday. &quot;We do believe the orgs we&#39;ve listed on our public blog have been targeted.&quot;

Also on Monday, Mandiant Consulting CTO Charles Carmakal told The Register that the Google-owned threat investigators are tracking a &quot;new, ongoing ShinyHunters-branded campaign&quot; that uses voice-phishing techniques to steal SSO credentials. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/nex_brax_dualboot_fondleslabs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For most mobile devices, the OS is either Android or iOS, but a pair of new systems promises a host of additional OS options you can dual boot into. The Android phone can run Linux and boot into Windows 11 where it functions as a PC while the tablet runs a smorgasbord of Google-free OSes.

Nex comes first, if only by age. It&#39;s launching the NexPhone. This is a decently specced Android phone, but with one unusual feature and one that we&#39;ve not heard about before. The first is that, along with a clean copy of Android 16 with its own desktop mode, it will also include a bundled Debian Linux VM for running hardware-accelerated desktop Linux apps.

In addition, for a denser desktop experience, the device dual-boots with a copy of Windows 11 for Arm64, meaning that you can reboot into Windows; attach a screen, keyboard, and mouse with the bundled USB-C hub; and have a pocketable desktop computer.

The company behind the device, Nex, has been around for a decade: The Register covered the launch of the NexDock 2 in 2019 and a year later got its talons on one. A later version, the NexDock 360, is sold alongside Puri.sm&#39;s Librem 5 Linux phone. Founder and CEO Emre Kosmaz has a blog post explaining the history and inspiration behind the device.

Nex plans to start shipping the NexPhone in the third quarter of 2026. For now, Nex is asking for a $199 downpayment to reserve a phone, with another $350 to pay when the devices start shipping.

Brax Technologies is a newer company, started by prolific – and sometimes controversial – Youtuber Robert Braxman. Following the Brax2 phone in 2022, last year Brax successfully crowdfunded a $300 Google-free Android phone, the Brax3, on Indiegogo. It runs French de-Googled Android variant iodéOS, raised over $1M in backing, and started shipping in May 2025.

This year, Brax is following this up with an unusually expandable tablet called open_slate. Like the Nex phone, the open_slate will offer the ability to dual-boot: in this case, between a choice of de-Googled Android variants and several Linux distributions. On its forums, Brax has an open_slate &quot;megathread&quot; with more detailed specifications. For operating systems, it says:

Android-based systems (BraxOS, iodeOS, LineageOS, AOSP and others)

Native Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu Touch, Ubuntu, Debian, Yocto Linux and others)

So far, we must admit that these do actually look pretty decent and provide a number of the things that the Reg FOSS desk has long wanted in a tablet computer.

There will be two versions: one with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of flash, and one with 16 GB of memory and 256 GB of storage. It will also have a user-replaceable battery and a microSD slot for up to 1 TB of additional storage. All good stuff, if maybe not quite industry-redefining – but there is more promised.

As well as the microSD slot, the tablet will also have an M.2 slot for an NVMe SSD. That&#39;s different, and should be both much faster and more capacious than SDXC – and especially handy with a more mainstream Linux distro.

It is also promised to have two USB-C ports and a USB 2 type-A port as well. That would be very handy: this vulture has a Planet Computers Gemini, and its double USB-ports were one of reasons we backed its Kickstarter.

The specifications start to go overboard for us, though, when it comes to the hardware privacy switches: the device is planned to have no fewer than six which will fully disconnect, at the hardware level, multiple functions: camera, microphone, Bluetooth, GPS, mobile network, and Wi-Fi. That frankly seems like overkill, but we&#39;re sure that it will make some extremely privacy-conscious buyers salivate.

Although it&#39;s not been around as long as Nex, this is Brax Tech&#39;s third product launch, and we will be watching with interest to see how close the shipping hardware matches the company&#39;s goals.

Thanks to Reg reader RobX for telling us about the NexPhone.

            <h2>Clawdbot sheds skin to become Moltbot, can't slough off security issues</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/clawdbot_moltbot_security_concerns/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Security concerns for the new agentic AI tool formerly known as Clawdbot remain, despite a rebrand prompted by trademark concerns raised by Anthropic. Would you be comfortable handing the keys to your identity kingdom over to a bot, one that might be exposed to the open internet?

Clawdbot, now known as Moltbot, has gone viral in AI and developer circles in recent days, with fans hailing the open-source &quot;AI personal assistant&quot; as a potential breakthrough.

The long and short of it is that Moltbot can be controlled using messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Telegram, in a similar way to the GenAI chatbots everyone knows about.

Taking things a little further, its agentic capabilities allow it to take care of life admin for users, such as responding to emails, managing calendars, screening phone calls, or booking table reservations – all with minimal intervention or prompting from the user.

All that functionality comes at a cost, however, and not just the outlay so many seem to be making on Mac Mini purchases for the sole purpose of hosting a Moltbot instance.

In order for Moltbot to read and respond to emails, and all the rest of it, it needs access to accounts and their credentials. Users are handing over the keys to their encrypted messenger apps, phone numbers, and bank accounts to this agentic system.

Naturally, security experts have had a few things to say about it.

First, there was the furor around public exposures. Moltbot is a complex system, and despite being as easy to install as a typical app on the face of it, the misconfigurations associated with it prompted experts to highlight the dangers of running Moltbot instances without the proper know-how.

Jamieson O&#39;Reilly, founder of red-teaming company Dvuln, was among the first to draw attention to the issue, saying that he saw hundreds of Clawdbot instances exposed to the web, potentially leaking secrets.

He told The Register that the attack model he reported to Moltbot&#39;s developers, which involved proxy misconfigurations and localhost connections auto-authenticating, is now fixed. However, if exploited, it could have allowed attackers to access months of private messages, account credentials, API keys, and more – anything to which Clawdbot owners gave it access.

According to his Shodan scans, supported by others looking into the matter, he found hundreds of instances exposed to the web. If those had open ports allowing unauthenticated admin connections, it would allow attackers access to the full breadth of secrets in Moltbot.

&quot;Of the instances I&#39;ve examined manually, eight were open with no authentication at all and exposing full access to run commands and view configuration data,&quot; he said. &quot;The rest had varying levels of protection.

&quot;Forty-seven had working authentication, which I manually confirmed was secure. The remainder fell somewhere in between. Some appeared to be test deployments, some were misconfigured in ways that reduced but didn&#39;t eliminate exposure.&quot;

On Tuesday, O&#39;Reilly published a second blog detailing a proof-of-concept supply chain exploit for ClawdHub – the AI assistant&#39;s skills library, the name of which has not yet changed.

He was able to upload a publicly available skill, artificially inflate the download count to more than 4,000, and watch as developers from seven countries downloaded the poisoned package.

The skill O&#39;Reilly uploaded was benign, but it proved he could have executed commands on a Moltbot instance.

&quot;The payload pinged my server to prove execution occurred, but I deliberately excluded hostnames, file contents, credentials, and everything else I could have taken,&quot; he said.

&quot;This was a proof of concept, a demonstration of what&#39;s possible. In the hands of someone less scrupulous, those developers would have had their SSH keys, AWS credentials, and entire codebases exfiltrated before they knew anything was wrong.&quot;

ClawdHub states in its developer notes that all code downloaded from the library will be treated as trusted code – there is no moderation process at present – so it&#39;s up to developers to properly vet anything they download.

Therein lies one of the key issues with the product. It is being heralded by nerds as the next big AI offering, one that can benefit everyone, but in reality, it requires a specialist skillset in order to use safely.

Eric Schwake, director of cybersecurity strategy at Salt Security, told The Register: &quot;A significant gap exists between the consumer enthusiasm for Clawdbot&#39;s one-click appeal and the technical expertise needed to operate a secure agentic gateway.

&quot;While installing it may resemble a typical Mac app, proper configuration requires a thorough understanding of API posture governance to prevent credential exposure due to misconfigurations or weak authentication.

&quot;Many users unintentionally create a large visibility void by failing to track which corporate and personal tokens they&#39;ve shared with the system. Without enterprise-level insight into these hidden connections, even a small mistake in a &#39;prosumer&#39; setup can turn a useful tool into an open back door, risking exposure of both home and work data to attackers.&quot;

The security concerns surrounding Moltbot persist even when it is set up correctly, as the team at Hudson Rock pointed out this week.

Its researchers said they looked at Moltbot&#39;s code and found that some of the secrets shared with the assistant by users were stored in plaintext Markdown and JSON files on the user&#39;s local filesystem.

The implication here is that if a host machine, such as one of the Mac Minis being bought en masse to host Moltbot, were infected with infostealer malware, then it would mean the secrets stored by the AI assistant could be compromised.

Hudson Rock is already seeing malware as a service families implement capabilities to target local-first directory structures, such as those used by Moltbot, including Redline, Lumma, and Vidar.

It is fathomable that any of these popular strains of malware could be deployed against the internet-exposed Moltbot instances to steal credentials and carry out financially motivated attacks.

If the attacker is also able to gain write access, then they can turn Moltbot into a backdoor, instructing it to siphon sensitive data in the future, trust malicious sources, and more.

&quot;Clawdbot represents the future of personal AI, but its security posture relies on an outdated model of endpoint trust,&quot; said Hudson Rock. &quot;Without encryption-at-rest or containerization, the &#39;Local-First&#39; AI revolution risks becoming a goldmine for the global cybercrime economy.&quot;

O&#39;Reilly said that Moltbot&#39;s security has captured the attention of the industry recently, but it is only the latest example of experts warning about the risks associated with wider deployments of AI agents.

In a recent interview with The Register, Palo Alto Networks chief security intel officer Wendi Whitmore warned that AI agents could represent the new era of insider threats.

As they are deployed across large organizations, trusted to carry out tasks autonomously, they become increasingly attractive targets for attackers looking to hijack these agents for personal gain.

The key will be to ensure cybersecurity is rethought for the agentic era, ensuring each agent is afforded the least privileges necessary to carry out tasks, and that malicious activity is monitored stringently.

&quot;The deeper issue is that we&#39;ve spent 20 years building security boundaries into modern operating systems,&quot; said O&#39;Reilly. &quot;Sandboxing, process isolation, permission models, firewalls, separating the user&#39;s internal environment from the internet. All of that work was designed to limit blast radius and prevent remote access to local resources.

&quot;AI agents tear all of that down by design. They need to read your files, access your credentials, execute commands, and interact with external services. The value proposition requires punching holes through every boundary we spent decades building. When these agents are exposed to the internet or compromised through supply chains, attackers inherit all of that access. The walls come down.&quot;

Heather Adkins, VP of security engineering at Google Cloud, who last week warned of the risks AI would present to the world of underground malware toolkits, is flying the flag for the anti-Moltbot brigade, urging people to avoid installing it.

&quot;My threat model is not your threat model, but it should be. Don&#39;t run Clawdbot,&quot; she said, citing a separate security researcher who claimed Moltbot &quot;is an infostealer malware disguised as an AI personal assistant.&quot;

Principal security consultant Yassine Aboukir said: &quot;How could someone trust that thing with full system access?&quot; ®

You don’t have to spend a fortune to have a robot clean your floors. Here’s our pick of the most cost-effective bots.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Today’s robot vacuums are becoming a bit like cars: with all the features, upgrades, and fancy trimmings available these days, it’s easy to forget that they can just be simple machines that get us from point A to point B. Yes, some bots blow hot air on their bums (mop pads), deftly navigate dog poop, and have arms to pick up your socks, but there are plenty of basic budget robot vacuums that just do a decent job of cleaning your floor autonomously — as long as you tidy up first.

Fancier models have obstacle recognition, and some even use AI-powered cameras to tell popcorn from poop and avoid the latter. If you want one of those, check out my best robot vacuum buying guide. But if you think you can manage the task of picking up after yourself (and your puppy), a budget bot will save you a lot of money and still do a good job cleaning your floor.

To judge its vacuuming power, I run every robot vacuum through a series of tests on hardwood and carpet, including flour, kitty litter, oatmeal, and pet and human hair. I test obstacle avoidance using cables, shoes, socks, and bed skirts. I test mopping effectiveness on hardwood and tile floors using dried and moist messes. If the robot has an auto-empty dock, I test to see how well it empties the onboard bin, as well as any other features of the dock. I run the robot vacs around three different levels in my home to see how they handle different surfaces, room transitions, and edge sensing. I evaluate how long they run before needing to recharge and test each app, focusing on its mapping functions to see how simple they are to use and how reliable they are. I also examine each robot’s build quality and parts availability, and I totally judge them based on how much my cat Boone likes to play with them.

Yes, there are sub-$150 robots out there. No, I do not recommend you buy them. With so many new models coming out almost daily, it’s better to look for a sale on an older model from a well-known company than buy a no-name budget bot. You can pick up a brand new Roborock with mapping and advanced navigation for half its original price. These gadgets should last for years, so it’s not like buying last season’s Prada slip-ons.That said, sales are hard to keep track of, so some of the prices listed here may seem high for a budget bot. If you see one that fits your needs, keep an eye on The Verge’s deals page for when they go on an even better sale.

The cheaper the bot, the more important suction power is, as they tend to have fewer features that improve cleaning. Higher-end robots have things like better brushes, carpet boost mode, and dirt detection. At a minimum, look for 2,500Pa (if the manufacturer lists suction power; some don’t). I also much prefer rubber roller brushes or a rubber / bristle hybrid over just bristle brushes. Rubber rollers pick up more dirt and tangle less than bristles.

Bear in mind that most budget mopping bots don’t really mop — it’s more just using a damp cloth to pick up the fine dust the robot’s vacuum left behind, which is useful but not essential. Mop attachments with water reservoirs also take up space on a robot and mean a smaller bin.

A big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. Eight hundred milliliters is the largest I’ve seen, but anything over 450 ml is decent on a budget bot. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots and the prevalence of auto-empty docks, it’s hard to find robots with big bins. But if you’re on a budget and don’t want to spend extra for the dock, a big bin will mean less hands-on time with your vacuum.

If you can swing it, I strongly recommend an auto-empty dock, and there are finally some cheaper versions out there. While it’s a nice-to-have rather than a must-have, delegating the chore of emptying the bin to the robot means your floors will be cleaner, since a vacuum with a full bin won’t suck up dirt.

Choosing an older version of a high-end robot will get you the best navigation, but there are now more budget bots with at least basic lidar-powered navigation and mapping. If you can swing it, it really is worth investing in a bot that knows where it’s going. Non-mapping bots may miss entire sections of your home and, when they resume after charging, may start again where they just cleaned. However, mapping is less important if you want a bot for a single room or a small apartment. Most bump-and-roll bots do include a gyroscope function, which at least makes them go in a straight line.

While most bots can recharge and resume (go back to their charging base and refuel before going back out again), a bot that can go for at least two hours on one charge will get the job done more quickly and be less annoying. I look for at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is the best).

A lot of budget bots have barely usable apps, which is another reason why buying a lower-cost option from a company with higher-end models gets you a better experience — the app is usually more polished. A good basic app, though, should have the ability to set multiple schedules to send the robot out, an option for a do-not-disturb period (so it doesn’t start up again at 2AM because it finally recharged), and a way to link to voice assistants and smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple’s Siri.

Even at the budget end, you’ll be spending $200 to $300 on a robot vacuum, so repairability and the availability of replacement parts are a big bonus.

Cheap, even with the auto-empty dock A dual mop and dustbin means no swappingRoom-specific cleaningCarpet boost

Short battery lifeSlow to rechargeDocking can be spottyBasic obstacle detection

Suction power: 5,300Pa / Dustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Mopping option: Yes / Mapping: Yes, lidar / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Runtime: 100 mins, 2,600mAh battery/ Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home

For around $300, TP-Link’s Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features typically found only on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock.

Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up.

Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it generally picked up all visible debris.

Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water for a good surface clean.

Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as three rotations.

The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can also set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.

5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price

It’s also easy to start a clean from the app, and I really like that you can tap on the map to send the robot to that spot.

The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally has trouble repositioning itself on its dock.

You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.

A more expensive budget robot vacuum and mop that adds AI-powered obstacle avoidance, more suction power, better mopping and longer runtime

Suction power: 10,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 600ml / Runtime: 150 mins, 5200 mAh / Brush style: single bristle / rubber hybrid / Auto-empty dock option: yes / Mapping: yes / Keep-out zones: yes / Works with:  Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts

Roborock’s Q10 S5 is a step up from the Tapo RV30, thanks to double the suction power, a much larger battery and longer runtime, AI-powered obstacle avoidance, and the ability to automatically detect carpet. It also has a vibrating mopping system that does a better job at scrubbing your floors, and it can lift its mop up to 8mm to pass over low-pile carpets.

It has a more advanced lidar-based mapping and navigation system, which, like the Tapo, lets you set specific rooms to clean, create no-go zones, and customize cleaning schedules. But unlike the Tapo, it moves more intelligently around the house and is less prone to getting stuck.

However, the robot vacuum alone costs more than the Tapo with the auto-empty base. If you upgrade to the Q10 S5 Plus, which includes an auto-empty base, you’re looking at over $500. It is frequently on sale, however, which makes it worth considering if you want a budget bot with better vacuuming and mopping.

One downside is that the bot is much larger and wider than the Tapo, so it may not fit into some tighter spaces. The Roborock app is more fully featured than Tapo’s, giving you lots of options for almost infinite customization.

A solid vacuum-only bot with big wheels, a big bin, and good runtime. It uses lidar for navigation and mapping so you can set keep-out zones and clean specific rooms, plus there’s a version with an auto-empty dock.

Suction power: unknown / Dustbin capacity: 500ml / Runtime: 120 mins / Brush style: single bristle / rubber hybrid / Auto-empty dock option: yes / Mapping: yes / Keep-out zones: yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home

The Shark Navigator RV2120 is a basic vacuum-only bot that’s a step up from my previous Shark pick, the Shark Ion, thanks to lidar navigation. This means it can map your home without bumping and rolling around blindly like the Ion. Mapping lets you send it to clean specific rooms and add keep-out zones to prevent it from going where you don’t want it to.

There are no bells and whistles like AI-powered obstacle detection or room-specific cleaning settings, but the RV2120 does the basics well. It has a nice big bin, a simple app experience, decent battery life, and good repairability. It’s also fairly bullish, pushing through fabric skirting to go under beds and sofas, something not all lidar bots will do. It is very loud and rattly, even at its lowest power level.

Unlike many budget bots, it uses a hybrid roller brush that’s both bristle and plastic and doesn’t get as tangled as standard bristle brushes.

But the best thing ‘bout this bot is its tank-like wheels that will roll right over anything in its path, including high transitions between rooms, obstacles like lounger chair legs, and other furniture traps that regularly stump other bots.

The Shark RV2120AE model includes an auto-empty dock. I love that Shark’s auto-empty docks don’t require replacement dust bags — which saves money in the long run. However, the RV2120AE is more expensive than the Tapo RV30, even after factoring in the cost of bags for the latter.

One benefit of Shark vacuums to consider over the Tapo is that they’re very repairable. You can buy replacement parts for almost everything on the bot, unlike with the Tapo.

Big binSlim profileAvoids obstaclesQuietEasily repairable

Suction power: 2,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 600ml / Runtime: 100 mins / Brush style: single bristle / rubber hybrid / Auto-empty dock option: no / Mapping: no / Keep-out zones: no / Works with: n/a

The Eufy 11S Max is a rarity — a robot vacuum that doesn’t use Wi-Fi at all. There’s not even an app. Instead, you just press the button, and off it trundles. It also comes with a remote if you’d rather not get up off the couch, and you can use that to program it to clean at a specific time.

The 11S is super slim, 72.5mm high, with no lidar tower, so it will get under most couches. It has a big 600ml bin, and I was very impressed with how much it got up off my hardwood floors, even with its relatively small 2,000Pa of suction. There are three cleaning levels, and at the lowest, it registers around 55db, which is quiet enough to run in a home office.

It does have a smallish battery — only 100 minutes of runtime — but it will go back and recharge. For $200, this is the perfect budget bot for those wary of or who don’t want to deal with an app or Wi-Fi. It’s a bump-and-roll bot, meaning there are no real navigation skills. But it has plenty of replaceable parts, including the battery and wheels, so you can keep it going for a long time.

Update, January 27th: Adjusted pricing and availability. Added new picks, including the Shark Navigator RV2120 and Roborock Q10 S5. Sheena Vasani also contributed to this post.

Electricity costs spiked around ‘data center alley’ as frigid temperatures threatened the power grid.

The colossal winter storm that swept across 34 states left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity. Bitterly cold temperatures lingering after Winter Storm Fern are still testing power grids, already under stress from a rush of new AI data centers.

Over the weekend, wholesale electricity prices soared in Virginia, the state with the most data centers. And while that’s not surprising during a spike in energy demand for heating, it could add to the growing discontent over rising utility bills that has fueled opposition to data centers across the US. Utilities and grid operators were already hard-pressed to meet the increasing power needs of AI, which can make it even harder to prepare ahead of a weather disaster.

“It’s certainly causing more pricing volatility,” says Nikhil Kumar, program director at energy consulting firm GridLab.

“It’s certainly causing more pricing volatility”

Kumar is quick to add that it’s still too early to say exactly what impact data centers have had on power grids during this week’s cold snap, and that the effects can vary from place to place. But this week’s stress test will be important to watch amid the challenges power grids face ahead as the US copes with a shifting energy landscape and a changing climate.

In Virginia, wholesale electricity prices climbed above $1,800 on Sunday compared to around $200 the day prior, CNBC reports. Utility Dominion Energy, the biggest energy provider, didn’t immediately respond to questions from The Verge about factors influencing rising wholesale costs, and how much that would affect residential customers’ bills. The company announced on Monday that it had restored power to 85 percent of 48,000 customers impacted by the storm in Virginia.

Keep in mind that many different issues drive up energy costs. Electricity demand is rising more steeply than it has in more than a decade because of AI data centers, as well as domestic manufacturing and the electrification of homes and buildings. Utilities are also having to spend a lot of money upgrading old infrastructure, as well as repairing damage from intensifying climate-related disasters like storms that have contributed to longer power outages in the US.

With electricity grids nearing a century old and a growing need to expand transmission lines to connect new power sources and customers, “we’re working with our grandfather’s Buick,” says George Gross, professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois’ Grainger College of Engineering.

When one local utility experiences an emergency, it can usually draw extra resources from others. Officials were more worried about this winter storm limiting that kind of aid, given how large of an area it affected. “So many of them are caught in exactly the same trouble that you can’t get necessarily help from your neighbors,” Gross says.

Extreme weather raises prices because of the spike in demand for heating or cooling and congestion along power lines. Supply scarcity can also make energy more expensive and raise the risk of outages if cold spells freeze up the production of natural gas, the primary energy source for electricity and heating in the US. Ice accumulating on power lines and tree branches — the biggest threat to power grids this week — can lead to outages.

We saw all of these factors come into play during Winter Storm Fern. They also led to more devastating outages in Texas in 2021 when millions of residents lost power and at least 246 people lost their lives as a result of Winter Storm Uri.

Fortunately, this week’s cold snap hasn’t been as devastating, thanks in part to preparations by utilities and power grid operators. Texas in particular has deployed more batteries for energy storage since 2021, which helped this week.

The Department of Energy also issued orders over the past several days to grid operators overseeing Texas and much of the East Coast authorizing them to deploy backup generators at data centers and other major industrial facilities “regardless of limits established by environmental permits or state law.”

And yet we don’t know how much those measures can help reduce a supply crunch because it’s unclear how that would work logistically and what authority the federal government even has in these cases, experts tell The Verge. That order hasn’t applied to generators in Texas so far because the state didn’t reach a high enough energy alert level, according to Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at The University of Texas at Austin.

“If this is going to be a tool that we’re going to use, we need to figure this out well in advance, before staring down a winter storm,” he says. “Making policy during emergency situations, usually it doesn’t yield the best policy.”

High power prices could eventually incentivize AI data center operators to voluntarily curb their electricity consumption during demand spikes. They can even earn money doing this through what are called demand response programs. Similarly energy-hungry data centers used as crypto mines have earned millions in recent years doing just that. But Rhodes doesn’t expect tech companies obsessed with AI following suit very soon.

“Right now, there’s just so much hype,” Rhodes says. “They almost don’t care what the price of electricity is, that’s de minimis when it comes to their generating of AI value.”

More than 489,000 customers across the US are still without power as of writing on Tuesday. And until the cold lets up, the risk of ice accumulating on critical infrastructure doesn’t either.

From simple fitness bands and rugged sports watches to rings, these are the best trackers you can get.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Fitness trackers have come a long way from the simple bands that tracked steps and little else. Modern trackers can monitor everything from your heart health to how well you’ve recovered from a hard bout of training. Even flagship smartwatches, which used to be lackluster trackers, have become pretty adept workout companions. Whatever your fitness goals are, there’s probably a fitness tracker that can help you achieve them.

Compared to some other gadgets, wearables are incredibly personal, which means there are a few extra considerations you’ll have to take into account before reaching for your wallet. It makes it hard to say that any one fitness tracker is the best for everyone. Thankfully, the best thing about fitness trackers in 2026 is that there’s enough variety to fit into every kind of lifestyle.

Fitness trackers are meant to help you keep track of your health and activity. We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy. Some factors we consider in our rankings are durability, performance, accuracy versus consistency in metrics, and, of course, battery life.

Who is this fitness tracker for? The ideal fitness tracker for hardcore athletes will look different than the best one for casual users looking to get a few more steps in.

A fitness tracker should be able to go at least two to three days between charges. If it’s a flagship smartwatch, it should at least offer quick charging.

Is it a band or a smartwatch? Is it comfortable to wear 24/7?

What metrics does this device track? We prioritize active minutes over steps and calorie burn, but health metrics like resting heart rate, VO2 Max, and sleep quality are pluses.

Accuracy is nice, but it’s more important for measuring progress that your device delivers consistent results for heart rate, distance tracking, and steps.

Certain trackers are limited to specific phone ecosystems — others work regardless of your phone. We prioritize the latter wherever possible.

Stacked feature set for the priceLooks spiffyGood battery life

Touchscreen and voice commands are finickyCan’t edit workoutsAI chatbots are meh

Size: 43mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 29.5g for standard, 31.7g for premium / Battery life: Up to 10 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: Five GNSS systems / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A

Hear us out: the Amazfit Active 2 is the best all-rounder on the block. Smartwatches are definitely getting more high-tech, but the Active 2 keeps the spirit of a humble fitness tracker — a good price, all the basic health features with a holistic tracking approach, and a comfy yet stylish design. At $99.99 for the standard version and $129.99 for the premium version with a leather band, you get an incredible amount of bang for your buck.

The hardware and design are surprisingly chic for the price. The standard version has a stainless steel case and tempered glass screen, while the premium version bumps you up to sapphire crystal and gets you an extra leather strap. The screen itself is nice and bright at 2,000 nits, and you get an estimated 10 days of regular use on a single charge. (In testing, I got closer to eight or nine days as a power-user.) European users also get NFC payments.

As far as health features go, you get all the basics like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. It’s also got a daily readiness score and detailed sleep tracking if you’re into recovery metrics. (There’s also a Zepp Aura AI chatbot if you ever want to get more in-depth insights into your recovery metrics; it costs an extra $77 yearly, including taxes, but it’s also optional.) For workouts, it supports 160 different sport types, including HYROX and a strength training mode that automatically counts reps. The Active 2 also adds offline maps, turn-by-turn directions, the ability to connect to third-party peripherals, and Zepp Coach — an AI-powered coach that can generate custom training plans for you. Built-in GPS with five satellite systems is also included.

I don’t have a lot to complain about. My biggest gripes are that the touchscreen is hard to use with sweaty fingers and the onboard AI assistant for voice commands sometimes requires you to enunciate. It does lack advanced health features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, but that’s not really the point of something like the Active 2. This is meant to be a classic, basic fitness tracker that happens to look like a watch — and it does so with aplomb.

Bright displayLong battery lifeTons of training and health featuresNo subscriptions

Sizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)

The $250 Garmin Venu Sq 2 is the watch I recommend for anyone looking to replace their aging Fitbit Versa 2, 3, or 4. It’s got a similar look and vibe, with a much nicer OLED display and longer battery life.

Garmin is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking, and that’s not an exception here. Of course, you get the basics, like steps and calories burned, but you get a whole lot more, too. There’s built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as plenty of other sports profiles like yoga and strength training. For smart features, you get push notifications, timers, contactless payments, and a bunch of safety features like Garmin’s Incident Detection, which is the company’s take on fall detection. (You will need to carry your phone with you, however, as the Venu Sq 2 doesn’t have LTE.)

If you want the option of onboard music, you can shell out $50 extra for the Music Edition, which comes with enough storage for about 500 songs. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, as you’ll most likely have your phone on you since this isn’t a true standalone watch.

What I like most about this watch, however, is that it’s one that you can grow with. On top of recovery metrics and sleep tracking, it also has Garmin Coach — a built-in, free training program for beginner and intermediate-level runners hoping to tackle a 5K, 10K, or half marathon. For health tracking, you can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, intensity minutes (how many minutes of moderate exercise you get per week), stress, hydration, respiratory rate, and menstrual cycles. None of these existing data features are locked behind a paywall; however, Garmin introduced a premium tier last year that provides personalized AI-powered insights and additional features for $6.99 a month (or $69.99 a year).

One note: Garmin has since introduced both a Venu 3 and a Venu 4, which introduce a heart rate sensor, nap detection, and — in the case of the Venu 4 — the ability to view health metrics on the watch face. We liked the Venu 3 quite a bit, and it ticks off a lot of the right boxes — except for price. It’s $449.99, which puts it outside what I’d consider ideal for casual users, while the newly released Venu 4 is even more expensive at $549.99. Another option is Garmin’s Forerunner 165, a $249 budget training watch that’s quite similar to the Venu Sq 2 feature-wise, albeit with a sportier vibe.

Basically, go with what you find within your budget. I firmly believe older models are still a good choice if all you want is the fitness-tracking basics. This is especially true since newer software updates often make their way to older Garmin hardware, and Garmin users tend to hang onto their devices for a good while.

The Garmin Fenix 8 adds smart features like the ability to take calls on the wrist, and an on-board voice assistant.

Sizes: 43mm w/ 20mm straps; 7: 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 7X: 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 60g (43mm), 73g (47mm), 92g (51mm)/ Battery life: Up to 10 days (43mm), 16 days (47mm), 29 days (51mm) Display type: MIP or OLED / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GB

The Fenix 8 is Garmin’s response to the Apple Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch Ultra in terms of aesthetics, with added smart features. The watch has a circular OLED display with a Gorilla Glass or sapphire crystal lens, a stainless steel or titanium bezel, and a battery that lasts up to 26 days, depending on the size. These are mostly the same materials Apple and Samsung use for high-end smartwatches, though the Fenix 8 stands out with its circular frame. What sets it apart from its predecessor is the addition of many welcome smart features.

The smartwatch features a built-in microphone and speaker that lets you take calls, and its smart voice assistant can be used to set timers, start activities, or access your phone’s assistant to handle more complex tasks. The watch’s smarts are held back by its lack of LTE, which means some of its features (including the ability to make and receive calls) depend on it being connected to your phone via Bluetooth. That’s less of a limitation in your home, but it may be frustrating if you’d like to stay connected during a phone-free run. Cellular connectivity is available on the Fenix 8 Pro, which starts at $1,199.99.

But the reason to choose the Fenix 8 over other premium smartwatches is its plethora of fitness features. The free, built-in Garmin Coach offers running, cycling, and strength training plans, and will make tweaks based on data it collects about your health and how you’re performing in workouts. It will also suggest daily workouts, provide an estimated recovery time, and plot out a recommended pace time for long races using GPS data. It can even assess the impact a run has on your body and recommend a mileage cap to avoid overexertion.

This smartwatch can record your activity, heart rate, and sleep (including naps), and use that information to generate a daily health and wellness summary in the morning. It’ll also create an evening report suggesting how much sleep you need, and provide details about your upcoming workout. If you’re traveling, the Fenix 8 can offer suggestions for adjusting your sleep schedule and exercise routine. These features can help prepare you for your next race, while the smart features improve the watch’s usefulness when you’re not on the track.

More sizesSlimmer designExpanded auto workout detectionRedesigned appBetter battery life

Subscription required to get all featuresI still wish this had a charging case

Sizes: 12 proprietary sizes, 4–15, sizing kit needed / Weight: 4–6g (depends on size) / Battery life: Up to seven days / Display type: None / GPS: None / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: Up to 328 feet / Music storage: None

The vast majority of fitness trackers are worn on the wrist, but the $349 Oura Ring isn’t. The smart ring is a good option for people who are looking for something a little more discreet. It’s also less distracting than some other wrist-based options, as it lacks a screen and doesn’t mirror push notifications from your phone.

The Oura Ring 4 isn’t functionally that much different from the previous Gen 3. It’s slimmer, features an all-titanium design, has improved battery life, and has an updated sensor algorithm that Oura says is more accurate. None of these software features is gatekept to the Ring 4, so Gen 3 owners shouldn’t feel the need to upgrade unless their ring no longer lasts more than two days on a single charge. That said, the fourth-gen model has an expanded size range spanning from 4 to 15. If you felt your Gen 3 was a bit snug or couldn’t find a size that fit right, you may have a better option now.

While smaller than your average wearable, the Oura Ring still tracks a ton of metrics, including heart rate variability, body temperature, blood oxygen, all-day heart rate monitoring, and cycle tracking. Since launching, the Oura Ring has also added activity tracking, blood oxygen levels, chronotypes to help visualize your circadian rhythms, a social feature called Circles, improved stress tracking, and cardiovascular age and capacity metrics.

More recently, it’s added an AI chatbot, meal logging, and glucose tracking, though you’ll have to purchase a $99 Dexcom Stelo CGM to take advantage of the latter. It’s rolled out a more accurate sleep stages algorithm as well, and the app has been entirely revamped to better organize these features and metrics. An update that rolled out last year improved its step-tracking accuracy by using an algorithm that better detects when movement is the result of a step. The same update improved calorie burn estimates by using heart rate measurements to determine the intensity of your workouts.

The Oura Ring tracks typical metrics — such as steps and calories burned — but its main focus is sleep and recovery. Each day, you’re given three sets of scores for your readiness, sleep, and activity. It’s a simple, holistic look at your overall wellness, and it’s an ideal pick if you want a more hands-off approach to your data. In October, Oura also announced a feature called Health Panels, which lets you schedule a blood test with a local Quest Diagnostics location. The results include dozens of biomarkers relating to your cardiovascular and metabolic health, which you can view within Oura’s app. You can also ask Oura Advisor, the company’s AI chatbot, to help you parse the results.

If you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Watch, you may want to consider the $399.99 Galaxy Ring. It’s a bit more expensive than the base Oura Ring, but it doesn’t come with a subscription, and you get much better battery life when used with the Galaxy Watch. The hardware is also excellent, especially the charging case. That said, this is only an option for Android users, and even then, you don’t unlock its full potential unless you’ve got other Samsung gear.

You can read my experiences with a bunch of other smart rings, but right now, the Oura Ring is the most polished option with the best overall experience.

Super affordableGood feature set for the priceOLED display looks niceComfortable and lightweightLong battery life

Hard to put on one-handedSome app quirksGPS can be wonky

Size: 42mm x 24mm x 12.2mm with 16mm straps / Weight: 28g / Battery life: Up to 18 days / Display type: OLED / GPS: Tethered / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: None

It’s truly hard to beat the Amazfit Band 7’s $49.99 price — doubly so since you can often find it on sale for even less. Wearing the Band 7 feels like a throwback to 2014, which is great if all you’re looking for is a simple and casual tracker that won’t break the bank.

No one is going to compliment you on the Band 7’s design, but it’s got a handful of cute watch faces that make good use of its OLED touchscreen. And despite having an OLED display, you’ll still get roughly 14 days of battery life on a single charge. It’s also incredibly lightweight, making it a good option for sleep tracking as well.

You also get an absurd number of features for the price, including Amazon Alexa, continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, stress tracking, advanced sleep tracking, training metrics like VO2 max and load, abnormal heart rate alerts, menstrual tracking, push notifications, find my phone, a camera remote, and even a Pomodoro timer. You’re sacrificing contactless payments and will have to settle for tethered GPS, but this is a fair tradeoff considering everything else you’re getting. It’s not the best option for hardcore fitness tracking, but this is a great option if all you’re looking to do is casually track activity and your steps.

Amazfit’s been making surprisingly good budget trackers for a while. That said, if you’re a little wary of a lesser-known brand, the $159.95 Fitbit Charge 6 is a decent alternative. It’s pricier, but you get a lot of what Amazfit is missing. That includes access to Google services like YouTube Music, Google Wallet, and Google Maps. Plus, it has built-in GPS and the ability to broadcast your heart rate with some Bluetooth-compatible gym equipment.

Long battery lifeAlso gets you lots of complimentsComfortable to wearGreat priceAdds period tracking

Has fewer sensors than the ScanWatch 2Again, the OLED display is tiny

Sizes: 37mm with 18mm straps / Weight: 45g / Battery life: Up to 39 days / Display type: OLED display / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A

The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light is a fetching hybrid analog smartwatch. Think of it as a dressier fitness band with some Swatch-like design sensibilities. It’s got all your basics like simple push notifications, timers, and alarms. Plus, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS activities straight from the wrist. It looks spiffy on the wrist, and if you like a pop of color, Withings offers minty green and pale blue color options. It’s also got excellent battery life, with an estimated 30 days on a single charge. I got a little less in testing at around 25 days, but that’s still much better than the vast majority of flagship smartwatches. This also looks way more stylish than beefier multisport watches with similar battery life.

As its name suggests, the Light is a pared-down version of the $369.95 ScanWatch 2. The main things you’re missing are an EKG sensor for atrial fibrillation detection, a temperature sensor, blood oxygen tracking, and an altimeter for tracking elevation. For basic fitness tracking, you don’t really need those sensors. That’s why I think the extra $100 in savings is worth it for the Light, especially since both are lacking in safety features, contactless payments, and some other bells and whistles you can get from other watches in the $350 price range. That said, if you want extras, the ScanWatch 2 also gets you a slightly more elegant look thanks to the second step-counter dial.

Another option I like is the $179.99 Garmin Vivomove Sport, which actually dominated this category in the past few years. It’s hard to beat the price, especially since it gets you access to Garmin’s platform. However, Garmin’s “hidden” OLED display can get washed out in bright lighting, and battery life was significantly shorter than that of other hybrid analog watches at around five days. Still, if you’d prefer a platform focused on fitness rather than wellness, the Vivomove Sport may be the better choice over a Withings watch.

We finally get an always-on displayWe get double tap and wrist flick!So many more health features!5G!Fast charging!More durable!On-device Siri!Upgraded processorYou get a speaker too

Those bezels are still thiccWish the battery life was a skosh better

Sizes: 40mm, 44mm / Weight: 26.3g (40mm), 32.9g (44mm) / Battery life: Up to 18 hours / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB

The Apple Watch SE 3 being Apple’s most exciting smartwatch of 2025 was unexpected, but it’s true. Apple’s latest entry-level smartwatch has an always-on display that the company claims to be more scratch-resistant than its predecessor. Not to mention, it has the same S10 chip that’s in the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3, though it lacks the Ultra Wideband chip found in those higher-end models. Apple brought fast charging, on-device Siri, its double tap and wrist flick gestures, and a built-in speaker to the SE line for the first time. The cellular version of the Apple Watch SE 3 supports 5G for faster downloads and better coverage.

The better specs make it harder to recommend the pricier Apple Watch Series 11 unless you care about having a smartwatch that can take an EKG, although the SE 3 can passively check for signs of atrial fibrillation via irregular heart rhythm notifications. It can also send you sleep apnea notifications, and has more robust period tracking. That said, it can’t record your blood oxygen level, which is a feature Apple recently reintroduced to various Apple Watch models that support it in the US after being removed due to a copyright dispute in 2023.

The Apple Watch SE 3 was released alongside WatchOS 26, which includes additional fitness and wellness features. Workout Buddy uses your fitness data to generate personalized insights, advice, and pep talks through a virtual assistant. Your Workout Buddy will remind you of your goals, recent achievements, and recap your results at the end of your workout. WatchOS 26 also comes to the Apple Watch SE 2, Apple Watch Series 6 and above, and all Apple Watch Ultra models.

One of the few technical details Apple didn’t improve was battery life — the SE 3 still lasts around 18 hours per charge. In one of our tests, which included a cross-country flight and 48-minute mini golf session, the watch has 27 percent battery left after around 13 hours of use with no reliance on low power mode. The Apple Watch SE 3 is the one to get unless you need an Apple Watch with a larger screen, if you want more sophisticated health tracking, or you’d benefit from the ruggedness and multi-day battery life of the Apple Watch Ultra.

Where is Samsung in this? The squircle chonk doesn’t fit small wristsSleep apnea feature is limited to Galaxy phonesAGEs metric is baffling

Sizes: 47mm / Weight: 60.5g / Battery life: Up to 100 hours / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM, IP68 / Music storage: 32GB

Truthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra left me a bit disappointed after reviewing it — not because it’s a bad piece of hardware, but because it copies a bit too much from Apple. Even so, this is the most full-featured fitness smartwatch a Samsung phone owner can buy.

The Galaxy Watch 8’s squircle design may seem controversial at first, but it allowed Samsung to make the smartwatch slimmer than its predecessor. It also sits flatter against your skin, which makes it more comfortable to wear. I preferred the Galaxy Watch 7 over the Ultra for casual fitness tracking and wearability, and that’s still true with the Watch 8, but the improvements over the previous generation aren’t significant. Its battery is barely bigger, and its brighter screen (up to 3,000 nits vs. 2,000) didn’t make much of a difference even in direct sunlight.

There’s a Vascular Load feature, which measures how stressed your vascular system is while you sleep, but it doesn’t explain why this metric is important. Its Antioxidant Index, which gauges whether you’ve eaten enough fruits and vegetables, can help encourage you to eat more healthily when creating a new diet.

In testing, the sensor works by using blue, yellow, and infrared LEDs to pick up the carotenoid levels in your skin. Carotenoids are antioxidants that give fruits and vegetables their color. The sensor could be fooled by pressing any colorful object — a piece of broccoli, a blackberry (which exploded), a marker-colored finger, and a Cheeze-It — against it. I did find the Running Coach feature, which creates a training regimen based on your performance after a 12-minute run, to be helpful. Its assessment of my current fitness level was fair, and the workouts it suggested were well-structured.

As far as AI is concerned, the Galaxy Watch 8 has Google Gemini, which was hit or miss in my testing. It couldn’t send a message in Slack, and the K-pop-inspired running playlist it created had a few songs outside that genre, but it’s handy if you want to use Google’s AI on your wrist rather than taking out your phone. Google Gemini support is one feature of One UI 8 (Samsung’s fork of Wear OS 6, Google’s latest wearable operating system), which also includes Material 3 Expressive, a redesign optimized for circular watches. Live updates, which let you track things like deliveries, rideshares, and information from navigation apps, will also be coming in 2026. Samsung’s One UI 8 also came to the Galaxy Watch Ultra as a software update.

However, there’s still a significant gap between the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Ultra in my testing as far as accuracy, especially when it comes to GPS tracking. And what really sealed the deal for me was the difference in battery life. (The gaps are much less egregious between the base Apple Watch and Ultra 2.) The caveat is that if all you want is casual fitness tracking, the Galaxy Watch 8 is the better choice for wearability. It’s just more comfortable for sleep tracking and lighter overall. Just keep in mind it lacks the Ultra’s emergency siren and shortcut button.

Both watches have the same processor, a 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, some AI health features, and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The hardware in both current-gen Galaxy smartwatches makes for a more future-proof purchase, but I found the AI health features to be hit-or-miss in practice. As always, some features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, are limited to Samsung owners. That makes it hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to non-Samsung Android users.

Samsung’s latest smartwatch features a squircle design, Gemini, and some additional health features like an Antioxidant Index and Running Coach.

If the Ultra doesn’t float your boat, now is a good time to find the Galaxy Watch 7 series, particularly the base models, on sale. The base Galaxy Watch 8 isn’t a massive update over the Watch 7 in terms of actual use.

The Pixel Watch 4 isn’t just the best fitness smartwatch for Android — it’s the most interesting flagship smartwatch to have launched within the last year. The newer wearable features several hardware improvements over its predecessor, starting with the display, which offers thinner bezels and higher peak brightness. Google focused on repairability for the Pixel Watch 4, and you can now replace its screen and battery individually rather than scrapping the entire wearable.

Speaking of the battery, it can last a lot longer per charge. In our tests, the battery on the 45mm model lasted 45 hours on its first charge, which was 13 hours longer than the Pixel Watch 3. We averaged 36 to 42 hours with the always-on display enabled. Google also improved the Pixel Watch 4’s charging speed, and we were able to top up its battery from 14 to 97 percent in around 45 minutes.

Wear OS 6 comes preloaded on the Pixel Watch 4, which means Gemini is ready to go on your wrist. The smart assistant can be activated with a new Raise-to-Talk gesture, though it was hit-or-miss in our tests. A new AI-enabled feature called Smart Replies offers up personal replies to your incoming text messages, though it only works if you have a Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 9 series, or Pixel 10 series phone. Notification cooldown can automatically change the frequency with which you receive certain notifications without enabling a do-not-disturb mode.

One of the biggest fitness improvements to the Pixel Watch 4 is improved activity detection. The watch can automatically record cardio activities for at least 15 minutes, and you’ll receive a notification and activity recap within an hour of finishing. You can train AI to better recognize your preferred activities, too. We tested these features during walks, runs, and cycling sessions, and they worked well each time. However, automatic activity detection is currently limited to tracking these activities: walking, running, bike riding, spinning, rowing, elliptical training, and team sport workouts.

The Pixel Watch 4’s dual-frequency GPS allowed it to track my runs more accurately than the Pixel Watch 3, though the Galaxy Watch Ultra was even more accurate. The Pixel Watch 4 will also work with the new AI-powered Fitbit Health Coach, which can create exercise programs based on your goals and sleep, and can adapt to extenuating circumstances like injuries.

Sizes: 34.7 mm x 24 mm x 10.6 mm / Weight: 27g / Battery life: Up to 14 days / Display type: None / GPS: None / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: Up to 10 meters / Music storage: None

The Whoop MG isn’t a huge departure from the Whoop 4.0, which I reviewed previously, but it’s still the best choice for elite athletes. Its buckle still annoyed me, and bands from the previous generation are incompatible with this model, though Whoop will give you a credit for trading in your current bands. Its processor is 60 percent faster, but I didn’t notice any difference in day-to-day use, aside from faster data syncing with Whoop’s app. I did notice the bump in battery life from five to 14 hours, Whoop’s redesigned app, and a handful of new health and wellness features.

A key part of the Whoop MG’s appeal is the dense daily reports on your health and wellness accessible within its app. They verge on overwhelming, with an emphasis on how much activity has strained your body. The Whoop Coach (an AI-powered chatbot) summarizes your sleep duration, activity, and heart rate to give you advice on reaching the fitness goals you selected during setup.

Similarly, a feature called Healthspan calculates your Whoop Age based on three weeks’ worth of sleep, exercise, steps, VO2 Max, heart rate, and lean body mass data. It’ll update your Whoop Age weekly after its first assessment, but be mindful that it discounts factors like genetics, your environment, and lifestyle, which significantly impact the rate your body actually ages.

The Whoop MG has an FDA-cleared EKG reader, and can send you notifications if it detects atrial fibrillation. It can also give you blood pressure insights, but is currently in beta. Whoop Advanced Labs is an upcoming service that will let you send in a blood test to be reviewed by clinicians to give you even more health insights. If you like the distraction-free design of a smart ring, but want your wearable on your wrist instead of your finger, consider the Whoop MG.

Razer has announced the beta release of a new online customization tool compatible with several versions of its Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards at launch. Razer Synapse Web isn’t a full replacement for the company’s Synapse 4 desktop app. It’s instead designed to be a streamlined alternative accessible through a browser for situations where you’re not able, or don’t have the time, to download and install Razer’s desktop software.

Razer Synapse Web is now available for testing but is only compatible with Chromium-based browsers including Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Microsoft Edge. It currently supports the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHz, Huntsman V3 Pro TKL 8KHz, and Huntsman V3 Pro Mini keyboards, but the company says support for more hardware will “follow as the platform expands.”

The browser-based tool is described as a “lightweight tuning hub” and won’t feature all options available through Razer’s desktop software. But Synapse Web will still let you adjust settings and “core features” through simplified controls; view, edit, and save existing custom profiles stored on a connected device; and access Razer Chroma RGB quick effects lighting presets like fire, ripples, or cycling through the color spectrum.

Despite its limited functionality, Synapse Web will also be a welcome alternative for gamers already juggling desktop companion apps for other devices, but it’s not an entirely new idea. Companies like Keychron already offer robust browser-based configuration tools for their keyboards, as do keyboards that use open-source firmware like QMK

The closures are part of a move to double down on expanding Whole Foods Market.

Amazon Go and Fresh physical store locations will soon be no more, with Amazon announcing on Tuesday that it’s closing the majority of the stores and converting others into Whole Foods Market locations. Customers will still be able to order from Amazon Fresh online, but won’t be able to shop at physical stores with the same name. Amazon is also planning to expand its same-day delivery option for groceries and household essentials to more cities over the coming year.

At the same time, Amazon says it’s “planning to invest in opening more than 100 new Whole Foods Market stores over the next few years,” as well as five more convenience-store style Whole Foods Market Daily Shop locations by the end of this year. Additionally, a memo sent to Amazon employees on Tuesday mentions that “Amazon Grocery, our new unified private brand, now offers over 1,000 items at exceptional value,” and will be expanding in 2026.

CNBC reports that on Monday, former chief merchant for Amazon Fresh Grocery, John Farrell, announced in a post on LinkedIn that he is leaving Amazon and “moving on to explore new challenges.”

Amazon also stated that it will still be “testing new physical store experiences,” like its Amazon Grocery location in Chicago and a Whole Foods concept store in Pennsylvania, where shoppers can also purchase products from Amazon. Earlier this month, an Amazon proposal for a sprawling Walmart-like supercenter was approved in the Chicago suburb of Orland Park, Illinois. That development does not appear to be a Whole Foods Market, so Amazon’s plans for more of its own brick-and-mortar stores may still be in the works despite closing its book stores, 4-star stores, Pop Up shop, Style stores, and now Go and Fresh stores.

Update, January 27th: Added quote from memo sent to Amazon employees and noted former Amazon employee John Farrell’s departure from the company.

The cofounder of Spirit Crossing developer Spry Fox explains why the studio went back to being independent.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

When Netflix first acquired cozy game developer Spry Fox in 2022, it made a lot of sense. The studio had been around for over a decade and had several hits with mobile games like Triple Town and Alphabear. That approachable style of puzzle game seemed like a good fit for Netflix’s mobile-first strategy, and, as Spry Fox cofounder David Edery tells me, the partnership also meant that the team could focus on making the experiences they wanted to build without having to worry about monetization. “We just never were that good at making money from our games,” Edery explains.

Now, three years later, Spry Fox is once again independent after buying itself out from Netflix. The news comes as the streaming service’s fledgling gaming efforts are shifting, with a focus on TV-based games as opposed to mobile titles. Even studios behind successful games, like Squid Game: Unleashed, have been shuttered as part of the changes. But for Spry Fox, the decision to separate from Netflix was done for a different reason: to reach as large an audience as possible with the studio’s upcoming MMO Spirit Crossing.

“At some point, I increasingly became concerned about the fact that being a Netflix member-only game was a real issue for it,” Edery explains. “It’s a highly social game. People want to be able to play with their friends. If their friends are not Netflix members, that’s kind of a problem.”

Spirit Crossing is a large-scale multiplayer game about fostering friendship and community in a fantastical and adorable world. It’s the biggest experience the studio has ever made, but also feels like a natural progression; after achieving success with those early mobile titles, Spry Fox pushed further into the so-called “cozy” genre with the Animal Crossing-style series Cozy Grove. While those games are single-player, Spirit Crossing aims to do something similar but in a virtual world filled with lots of players. The goal is ambitious. “We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world,” says Edery. “That’s the sum total of everything that we care about.”

Development on Spirit Crossing predates the Netflix deal, and in fact represents something of a brief history of indie game funding over the last few years. The game’s initial prototype began life as an exclusive for Google’s Stadia streaming service. After Stadia’s high-profile implosion, Spry Fox retained ownership of the project, and eventually Epic picked up the game as part of its relatively new publishing initiative.

“We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world.”

“That was great because they were very supportive and they gave us a big budget,” Edery says of working with Epic. “And then the Netflix thing kind of came out of nowhere. I wasn’t looking to be acquired at the time, and I certainly didn’t think it would be Netflix of all companies, but they came by and it seemed like a good idea for a few different reasons.”

From the outside, Netflix’s efforts in gaming have seemed chaotic. The company has tried everything from games based on its shows to building a AAA studio without much success. Last year at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Netflix’s president of games, Alain Tascan, outlined a new plan focused on specific types of games, including what he called “mainstream” titles aimed at large audiences, of which Spirit Crossing was shown as an example. Of late, however, Netflix seems mostly focused on cloud-based games played on TVs instead of phones.

Despite all of that, Edery says the team at Spry Fox wasn’t impacted much by Netflix’s changing priorities. “We were essentially brought in to make and launch Spirit Crossing,” he says. “We just kept doing what we were doing, so I think we were less affected by changes than maybe other folks internally would have been. We had a pretty clear vision and, for better or worse, we weren’t going to be steered off of that.”

Edery says that at each stage, from Stadia to Netflix, Spirit Crossing grew in scope and ambition. And eventually it became clear that a game built around connecting as many people as possible didn’t fit so snugly in Netflix’s plans, which limit the platforms a game can launch on. Edery notes that Cozy Grove, for example, was most successful on the Nintendo Switch, where cozy games are very popular. “Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation, possibly a really problematic limitation,” he says of Spirit Crossing.

“Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation”

So the split from Netflix was done in the best interest of the game; while a Switch version has yet to be announced, Spirit Crossing will be coming to PC in addition to the iPhone and Android. And there’s still a partnership with Netflix in place, as the mobile version will still be free and exclusive to subscribers. “It still has to make sense for Netflix,” Edery notes. But there are obvious risks involved in going independent, and already the team is making sacrifices. Edery says that he and fellow cofounder Daniel Cook have reduced their salaries to $20,000 a year.

The majority of development on Spirit Crossing was finished during the three years Spry Fox was under the Netflix umbrella, and the team expects to launch the game this year. (You can currently sign up to play an alpha of the game.) Even before Spirit Crossing launches, Spry Fox’s long journey back to independence represents a rare positive story in an industry plagued with layoffs, cancellations, and studio closures. But there’s one big thing the team still has left to do, and it’s not something Edery is looking forward to: “We have to figure out how to make money now.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/27/1131796/the-first-human-test-of-a-rejuvenation-method-will-begin-shortly/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

            <h2>Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-27</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

Why chatbots are starting to check your age

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly.Now, two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates. Read the full story.

Humans have long dreamed of living among the stars, and for two decades hundreds of us have done so aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But a new era is about to begin in which private companies operate orbital outposts—with the promise of much greater access to space than before.

The ISS is aging and is expected to be brought down from orbit into the ocean in 2031. To replace it, NASA has awarded more than $500 million to several companies to develop private space stations, while others have built versions on their own. Read why we made them one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year, and check out the rest of the list.

For much of the last 15 years, the energy entrepreneur has worked to develop long-haul transmission lines to carry wind power across the Great Plains, Midwest, and Southwest. But so far, he has little to show for the effort.

Skelly has long argued that building such lines and linking together the nation’s grids would accelerate the shift from coal- and natural-gas-fueled power plants to the renewables needed to cut the pollution driving climate change.

            <div id="article-text">In the three years since ChatGPT’s explosive debut, OpenAI’s technology has upended a remarkable range of everyday activities at home, at work, in schools—anywhere people have a browser open or a phone out, which is everywhere.

Now OpenAI is making an explicit play for scientists. In October, the firm announced that it had launched a whole new team, called OpenAI for Science, dedicated to exploring how its large language models could help scientists and tweaking its tools to support them.

The last couple of months have seen a slew of social media posts and academic publications in which mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and others have described how LLMs (and OpenAI’s GPT-5 in particular) have helped them make a discovery or nudged them toward a solution they might otherwise have missed. In part, OpenAI for Science was set up to engage with this community.

And yet OpenAI is also late to the party. Google DeepMind, the rival firm behind groundbreaking scientific models such as AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, has had an AI-for-science team for years. (When I spoke to Google DeepMind’s CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis in 2023 about that team, he told me: “This is the reason I started DeepMind … In fact, it’s why I’ve worked my whole career in AI.”)

So why now? How does a push into science fit with OpenAI’s wider mission? And what exactly is the firm hoping to achieve?

I put these questions to Kevin Weil, a vice president at OpenAI who leads the new OpenAI for Science team, in an exclusive interview last week.

Weil is a product guy. He joined OpenAI a couple of years ago as chief product officer after being head of product at Twitter and Instagram. But he started out as a scientist. He got two-thirds of the way through a PhD in particle physics at Stanford University before ditching academia for the Silicon Valley dream. Weil is keen to highlight his pedigree: “I thought I was going to be a physics professor for the rest of my life,” he says. “I still read math books on vacation.”

Asked how OpenAI for Science fits with the firm’s existing lineup of white-collar productivity tools or the viral video app Sora, Weil recites the company mantra: “The mission of OpenAI is to try and build artificial general intelligence and, you know, make it beneficial for all of humanity.”

Just imagine the future impact this technology could have on science he says: New medicines, new materials, new devices. “Think about it helping us understand the nature of reality, helping us think through open problems. Maybe the biggest, most positive impact we’re going to see from AGI will actually be from its ability to accelerate science.”

He adds: “With GPT-5, we saw that becoming possible.”

As Weil tells it, LLMs are now good enough to be useful scientific collaborators. They can spitball ideas, suggest novel directions to explore, and find fruitful parallels between new problems and old solutions published in obscure journals decades ago or in foreign languages.

That wasn’t the case a year or so ago. Since it announced its first so-called reasoning model—a type of LLM that can break down problems into multiple steps and work through them one by one—in December 2024, OpenAI has been pushing the envelope of what the technology can do. Reasoning models have made LLMs far better at solving math and logic problems than they used to be. “You go back a few years and we were all collectively mind-blown that the models could get an 800 on the SAT,” says Weil.

But soon LLMs were acing math competitions and solving graduate-level physics problems. Last year, OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announced that their LLMs had achieved gold-medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad, one of the toughest math contests in the world. “These models are no longer just better than 90% of grad students,” says Weil. “They’re really at the frontier of human abilities.”

That’s a huge claim, and it comes with caveats. Still, there’s no doubt that GPT-5, which includes a reasoning model,  is a big improvement on GPT-4 when it comes to complicated problem-solving. Measured against an industry benchmark known as GPQA, which includes more than 400 multiple-choice questions that test PhD-level knowledge in biology, physics, and chemistry, GPT-4 scores 39%, well below the human-expert baseline of around 70%. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 (the latest update to the model, released in December) scores 92%.

The excitement is evident—and perhaps excessive. In October, senior figures at OpenAI, including Weil, boasted on X that GPT-5 had found solutions to several unsolved math problems. Mathematicians were quick to point out that in fact what GPT-5 appeared to have done was dig up existing solutions in old research papers, including at least one written in German. That was still useful, but it wasn’t the achievement OpenAI seemed to have claimed. Weil and his colleagues deleted their posts.

Now Weil is more careful. It is often enough to find answers that exist but have been forgotten, he says: “We collectively stand on the shoulders of giants, and if LLMs can kind of accumulate that knowledge so that we don’t spend time struggling on a problem that is already solved, that’s an acceleration all of its own.”

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”

For Weil, the question is this: “Does science actually happen faster because scientists plus models can do much more, and do it more quickly, than scientists alone? I think we’re already seeing that.”

In November, OpenAI published a series of anecdotal case studies contributed by scientists, both inside and outside the company, that illustrated how they had used GPT-5 and how it had helped. “Most of the cases were scientists that were already using GPT-5 directly in their research and had come to us one way or another saying, ‘Look at what I’m able to do with these tools,’” says Weil.

The key things that GPT-5 seems to be good at are finding references and connections to existing work that scientists were not aware of, which sometimes sparks new ideas; helping scientists sketch mathematical proofs; and suggesting ways for scientists to test hypotheses in the lab.

“GPT 5.2 has read substantially every paper written in the last 30 years,” says Weil. “And it understands not just the field that a particular scientist is working in; it can bring together analogies from other, unrelated fields.”

“That’s incredibly powerful,” he continues. “You can always find a human collaborator in an adjacent field, but it’s difficult to find, you know, a thousand collaborators in all thousand adjacent fields that might matter. And in addition to that, I can work with the model late at night—it doesn’t sleep—and I can ask it 10 things in parallel, which is kind of awkward to do to a human.”

Most of the scientists OpenAI reached out to back up Weil’s position.

Robert Scherrer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, only played around with ChatGPT for fun (“I used to it rewrite the theme song for Gilligan’s Island in the style of Beowulf, which it did very well,” he tells me) until his Vanderbilt colleague Alex Lupsasca, a fellow physicist who now works at OpenAI, told him that GPT-5 had helped solve a problem he’d been working on.

Lupsasca gave Scherrer access to GPT-5 Pro, OpenAI’s $200-a-month premium subscription. “It managed to solve a problem that I and my graduate student could not solve despite working on it for several months,” says Scherrer.

It’s not perfect, he says: “GTP-5 still makes dumb mistakes. Of course, I do too, but the mistakes GPT-5 makes are even dumber.” And yet it keeps getting better, he says: “If current trends continue—and that’s a big if—I suspect that all scientists will be using LLMs soon.”

Derya Unutmaz, a professor of biology at the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute, uses GPT-5 to brainstorm ideas, summarize papers, and plan experiments in his work studying the immune system. In the case study he shared with OpenAI, Unutmaz used GPT-5 to analyze an old data set that his team had previously looked at. The model came up with fresh insights and interpretations.

“LLMs are already essential for scientists,” he says. “When you can complete analysis of data sets that used to take months, not using them is not an option anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says he has been using LLMs in his research since the first version of ChatGPT came out.

Like Scherrer, he finds LLMs most useful when they highlight unexpected connections between his own work and existing results he did not know about. “I believe that LLMs are becoming an essential technical tool for scientists, much like computers and the internet did before,” he says. “I expect a long-term disadvantage for those who do not use them.”

But he does not expect LLMs to make novel discoveries anytime soon. “I have seen very few genuinely fresh ideas or arguments that would be worth a publication on their own,” he says. “So far, they seem to mainly combine existing results, sometimes incorrectly, rather than produce genuinely new approaches.”

I also contacted a handful of scientists who are not connected to OpenAI.

Andy Cooper, a professor of chemistry at the University of Liverpool and director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, is less enthusiastic. “We have not found, yet, that LLMs are fundamentally changing the way that science is done,” he says. “But our recent results suggest that they do have a place.”

Cooper is leading a project to develop a so-called AI scientist that can fully automate parts of the scientific workflow. He says that his team doesn’t use LLMs to come up with ideas. But the tech is starting to prove useful as part of a wider automated system where an LLM can help direct robots, for example.

“My guess is that LLMs might stick more in robotic workflows, at least initially, because I’m not sure that people are ready to be told what to do by an LLM,” says Cooper. “I’m certainly not.”

LLMs may be becoming more and more useful, but caution is still key. In December, Jonathan Oppenheim, a scientist who works on quantum mechanics, called out a mistake that had made its way into a scientific journal. “OpenAI leadership are promoting a paper in Physics Letters B where GPT-5 proposed the main idea—possibly the first peer-reviewed paper where an LLM generated the core contribution,” Oppenheim posted on X. “One small problem: GPT-5’s idea tests the wrong thing.”

He continued: “GPT-5 was asked for a test that detects nonlinear theories. It provided a test that detects nonlocal ones. Related-sounding, but different. It’s like asking for a COVID test, and the LLM cheerfully hands you a test for chickenpox.”

It is clear that a lot of scientists are finding innovative and intuitive ways to engage with LLMs. It is also clear that the technology makes mistakes that can be so subtle even experts miss them.

Part of the problem is the way ChatGPT can flatter you into letting down your guard. As Oppenheim put it: “A core issue is that LLMs are being trained to validate the user, while science needs tools that challenge us.” In an extreme case, one individual (who was not a scientist) was persuaded by ChatGPT into thinking for months that he’d invented a new branch of mathematics.

Of course, Weil is well aware of the problem of hallucination. But he insists that newer models are hallucinating less and less. Even so, focusing on hallucination might be missing the point, he says.

“One of my teammates here, an ex math professor, said something that stuck with me,” says Weil. “He said: ‘When I’m doing research, if I’m bouncing ideas off a colleague, I’m wrong 90% of the time and that’s kind of the point. We’re both spitballing ideas and trying to find something that works.’”

“That’s actually a desirable place to be,” says Weil. “If you say enough wrong things and then somebody stumbles on a grain of truth and then the other person seizes on it and says, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s not quite right, but what if we—’ You gradually kind of find your trail through the woods.”

This is Weil’s core vision for OpenAI for Science. GPT-5 is good, but it is not an oracle. The value of this technology is in pointing people in new directions, not coming up with definitive answers, he says.

In fact, one of the things OpenAI is now looking at is making GPT-5 dial down its confidence when it delivers a response. Instead of saying Here’s the answer, it might tell scientists: Here’s something to consider.

“That’s actually something that we are spending a bunch of time on,” says Weil. “Trying to make sure that the model has some sort of epistemological humility.”

Another thing OpenAI is looking at is how to use GPT-5 to fact-check GPT-5. It’s often the case that if you feed one of GPT-5’s answers back into the model, it will pick it apart and highlight mistakes.

“You can kind of hook the model up as its own critic,” says Weil. “Then you can get a workflow where the model is thinking and then it goes to another model, and if that model finds things that it could improve, then it passes it back to the original model and says, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this part wasn’t right, but this part was interesting. Keep it.’ It’s almost like a couple of agents working together and you only see the output once it passes the critic.”

What Weil is describing also sounds a lot like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaEvolve, a tool that wrapped the firms LLM, Gemini, inside a wider system that filtered out the good responses from the bad and fed them back in again to be improved on. Google DeepMind has used AlphaEvolve to solve several real-world problems.

OpenAI faces stiff competition from rival firms, whose own LLMs can do most, if not all, of the things it claims for its own models. If that’s the case, why should scientists use GPT-5 instead of Gemini or Anthropic’s Claude, families of models that are themselves improving every year? Ultimately, OpenAI for Science may be as much an effort to plant a flag in new territory as anything else. The real innovations are still to come.

“I think 2026 will be for science what 2025 was for software engineering,” says Weil. “At the beginning of 2025, if you were using AI to write most of your code, you were an early adopter. Whereas 12 months later, if you’re not using AI to write most of your code, you’re probably falling behind. We’re now seeing those same early flashes for science as we did for code.”

He continues: “I think that in a year, if you’re a scientist and you’re not heavily using AI, you’ll be missing an opportunity to increase the quality and pace of your thinking.”

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?

This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly. Two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates.

In one corner is the Republican Party, which has supported laws passed in several states that require sites with adult content to verify users’ ages. Critics say this provides cover to block anything deemed “harmful to minors,” which could include sex education. Other states, like California, are coming after AI companies with laws to protect kids who talk to chatbots (by requiring them to verify who’s a kid). Meanwhile, President Trump is attempting to keep AI regulation a national issue rather than allowing states to make their own rules. Support for various bills in Congress is constantly in flux.

So what might happen? The debate is quickly moving away from whether age verification is necessary and toward who will be responsible for it. This responsibility is a hot potato that no company wants to hold.

In a blog post last Tuesday, OpenAI revealed that it plans to roll out automatic age prediction. In short, the company will apply a model that uses factors like the time of day, among others, to predict whether a person chatting is under 18. For those identified as teens or children, ChatGPT will apply filters to “reduce exposure” to content like graphic violence or sexual role-play. YouTube launched something similar last year.

If you support age verification but are concerned about privacy, this might sound like a win. But there&#39;s a catch. The system is not perfect, of course, so it could classify a child as an adult or vice versa. People who are wrongly labeled under 18 can verify their identity by submitting a selfie or government ID to a company called Persona.

Selfie verifications have issues: They fail more often for people of color and those with certain disabilities. Sameer Hinduja, who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center, says the fact that Persona will need to hold millions of government IDs and masses of biometric data is another weak point. “When those get breached, we’ve exposed massive populations all at once,” he says.

Hinduja instead advocates for device-level verification, where a parent specifies a child’s age when setting up the child’s phone for the first time. This information is then kept on the device and shared securely with apps and websites.

That’s more or less what Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently lobbied US lawmakers to call for. Cook was fighting lawmakers who wanted to require app stores to verify ages, which would saddle Apple with lots of liability.

More signals of where this is all headed will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Trade Commission—the agency that would be responsible for enforcing these new laws—is holding an all-day workshop on age verification. Apple’s head of government affairs, Nick Rossi, will be there. He’ll be joined by higher-ups in child safety at Google and Meta, as well as a company that specializes in marketing to children.

The FTC has become increasingly politicized under President Trump (his firing of the sole Democratic commissioner was struck down by a federal court, a decision that is now pending review by the US Supreme Court). In July, I wrote about signals that the agency is softening its stance toward AI companies. Indeed, in December, the FTC overturned a Biden-era ruling against an AI company that allowed people to flood the internet with fake product reviews, writing that it clashed with President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

Wednesday’s workshop may shed light on how partisan the FTC’s approach to age verification will be. Red states favor laws that require porn websites to verify ages (but critics warn this could be used to block a much wider range of content). Bethany Soye, a Republican state representative who is leading an effort to pass such a bill in her state of South Dakota, is scheduled to speak at the FTC meeting. The ACLU generally opposes laws requiring IDs to visit websites and has instead advocated for an expansion of existing parental controls.

While all this gets debated, though, AI has set the world of child safety on fire. We’re dealing with increased generation of child sexual abuse material, concerns (and lawsuits) about suicides and self-harm following chatbot conversations, and troubling evidence of kids’ forming attachments to AI companions. Colliding stances on privacy, politics, free expression, and surveillance will complicate any effort to find a solution. Write to me with your thoughts.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.
