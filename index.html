            <h2>WHO slams US-funded newborn vaccine trial as "unethical"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/who-slams-us-funded-newborn-vaccine-trial-as-unethical/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The World Health Organization on Friday released a formal statement blasting a US-funded vaccine trial as “unethical,” because it would withhold an established, safe, and potentially lifesaving vaccine against hepatitis B from some newborns in Guinea-Bissau, Africa.

“In its current form, and based on publicly available information, the trial is inconsistent with established ethical and scientific principles,” the WHO concluded, after providing a bullet-point list of reasons the trial was harmful and low quality.

The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since notice of the US funding was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—had awarded $1.6 million to Danish researchers for their non-competitive, unsolicited proposal to conduct the trial.

The Danish researchers are led by Christine Stabell Benn and her husband Peter Aaby of the Bandim Health Project, which is based at the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen. Benn and her colleagues have long been controversial for their questionable practices in research into alleged vaccine safety concerns. Kennedy has cited their work in his decision to cut global vaccine funding.

The CDC’s funding of Benn’s hepatitis B vaccine trial also came soon after the agency’s advisors—who were handpicked by Kennedy—decided to abandon a long-standing universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine birth dose. The move was widely decried by health experts.

In the Guinea-Bissau trial, Benn’s team intended to randomize 14,000 newborns to receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at either birth or at six weeks, and then study differences in alleged safety outcomes. Currently, Guinea-Bissau gives the first vaccine dose at the six-week point, but has already decided to transition to recommend a birth dose in 2028. The reason for the delayed implementation is resource constraints.

“Exploiting scarcity is not ethical,” the WHO wrote in its statement today.

The United Nations health agency highlighted that the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose is “an effective, and essential public health intervention” that has “been used for over three decades, with more than 115 countries including it in their national schedules. “

“It prevents life‑threatening liver disease by stopping mother‑to‑child transmission at birth,” the WHO wrote, noting that more than 12 percent of adults in Guinea-Bissau have chronic hepatitis B.

In a section subtitled “Why withholding the vaccine is unethical,” the WHO lays out all the reasons the trial is dangerous.

“From what is publicly described, the [trial] protocol does not appear to ensure even a minimum level of harm reduction and benefit to the study participants (e.g., screening pregnant women and vaccinating newborns exposed to hepatitis B),” the WHO wrote.

As a proven lifesaving vaccine, withholding it from some study participants would expose newborns to serious and potentially irreversible harm, including chronic infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, the WHO argues. There is no scientific justification for withholding a proven intervention, and there is no credible evidence of the safety concerns that Benn and her colleagues claim to be looking for in their trial. The WHO also noted that the publicly available information about the trial indicates that it will be a single-blind, no-treatment-controlled design, which “raises a significant likelihood of substantial risk of bias, limiting interpretability of the study results and their policy relevance.”

As of now, the trial appears to be suspended. Nature News reported that in a January 22 press conference, health officials in Guinea-Bissau said that a technical and ethical review was pending. “There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau, said. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.”

Previously, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that the trial would not go forward. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services provided a statement saying that it was “proceeding as planned.”</div>

            <h2>Aided by AI, California beach town broadens hunt for bike lane blockers</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/santa-monica-deploys-ai-powered-parking-cameras-to-protect-bike-lanes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This spring, a Southern California beach town will become the first city in the country where municipal parking enforcement vehicles will use an AI system looking for potential bike lane violations.

Beginning in April, the City of Santa Monica will bring Hayden AI’s scanning technology to seven cars in its parking enforcement fleet, expanding beyond similar cameras already mounted on city buses.

“The more we can reduce the amount of illegal parking, the safer we can make it for bike riders,” Charley Territo, chief growth officer at Hayden AI, told Ars.

Hayden AI’s bus cameras, designed to detect bike lane and bus zone violations, currently exist in two other California cities: Oakland and Sacramento. The company also has installations around the country, including New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. In September 2025, the company announced that it had installed 2,000 systems on buses worldwide.

Late last year, over a 59-day period, Hayden AI also said its technology detected over 1,100 parking violations at the University of California, San Diego—and 88 percent of those were instances of blocking a bike lane.

Hayden AI says it sells its product to municipalities and related entities to not only increase bus speed (by removing obstructions) but also improve safety.

“We do that by [reducing] one of the biggest causes of collisions with buses—moving out of their lanes,” Territo added. “So the fewer times they have to make a turn, the fewer instances there are [of a crash].”

As part of its setup process, the San Francisco-based startup says that it begins any installation by first mapping a city. Then it teaches the AI the local parking enforcement rules. Typically, those rules say that cars can’t block a bike or bus lane. Traditionally, Hayden AI’s cameras have only been mounted on buses, so enforcement was limited to existing routes.

“We tell our system that if you see a vehicle that encroaches on a bike lane, capture a 10-second video and the license plate of that vehicle,” Territo said.

“From there, an evidence package goes to the [police] and they will review and verify the elements—that a prosecutable violation exists—and then they will issue a violation under [state law]. If there is no violation, the system doesn’t capture any data. The system is only looking for scenarios where a bike lane is blocked and a license plate is evident.”

Local bike advocates have applauded this expansion of automated enforcement.

“Enforcement cannot be everywhere at once. If we can extend their arm so these things can get done, and keep our community safe, that is a win,” Cynthia Rose, the director of Santa Monica Spoke, told Ars. While warning of the potential misuse of bulk data collection in general, Rose was on board with Hayden AI’s particular plan.

“Anywhere where there’s bike infrastructure, where I know of, [blocking the lane] is a problem,” Rose said. “It’s tantamount to parking in handicapped zones. It’s just a flat no.”</div>

            <h2>Verizon imposes new roadblock on users trying to unlock paid-off phones</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Verizon this week imposed a new roadblock for people who want to pay off device installment plans early in order to get their phones unlocked. The latest version of Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off their device installment plan online or in the Verizon app.

Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store.

Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on another network, letting customers switch from one carrier to another. Previously, the 35-day waiting period for unlocks was only applied when a customer paid off the plan with a Verizon gift card.

“If you payoff [sic] a device payment agreement balance online or in the My Verizon App, or if a Verizon Gift Card is used to purchase a smartphone or pay off a remaining balance, the unlocking process will be delayed by 35 days,” the current version of the policy says. “This window allows for the verification of the gift card’s funds to ensure they were not obtained through fraudulent or illegal means.”

The paragraph above only explains why the waiting period is necessary for gift-card payments despite applying the 35-day wait to online and app payments as well. In a previous version of the policy that was implemented on January 27 and still in place as of February 9, the 35-day waiting period applied only when a Verizon gift card is used to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance.

The 35-day waiting period provision was changed to include online and app payments by February 11. We were made aware of the most recent change thanks to a tip from Ars forum member User_E.

Despite the significant update that happened this week, Verizon still lists the effective date of the device unlocking policy as January 27. It thus appears that Verizon is applying the 35-day wait after online and app payments retroactively, without disclosing that the policy changed after January 27.

The 35-day waiting period seems to apply regardless of how long the phone has been in use. For example, if you were 18 months into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and decided to pay the remaining balance early and switch carriers, you’d still have to wait 35 days for an unlock in most scenarios.

A Verizon spokesperson told Ars today that customers meeting the requirements for a quick unlock will “typically” receive it within 24 hours. But “if you pay online, through the app, or use a ‘non-secure’ method (like a Verizon Gift Card, paper check, or magnetic stripe swipe), there is a 35-day security delay before the unlock triggers to prevent fraud,” the spokesperson said. Verizon did not explain why the device unlocking policy still has an effective date of January 27 despite the change made this week.

It is possible to pay off an installment plan early by going to a Verizon store. But there are limits on this, too. Another Verizon FAQ says the company will unlock a phone “when you use a secure payment type at a Verizon store. Payments made through your account online, in the My Verizon app, a Verizon Authorized Retailer, or by phone delay the unlock by 35 days.” It’s not clear when this FAQ was last updated.

The Verizon Authorized Retailer limitation means that to get a quick unlock, you have to go to a Verizon corporate store rather than a Verizon Authorized Retailer that isn’t owned by Verizon. Verizon corporate stores accounted for only about 20 percent of Verizon stores, according to Wave7 research cited in a 2021 Fierce Network article.

As for the “secure payment type” requirement, you can satisfy that by paying with cash, a credit card with an EMV chip, or contactless payment method like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. The requirements may be different for consumer and business customers. A Verizon business FAQ says paying off a device using a bill credit also triggers a 35-day wait, but that caveat isn’t mentioned in the Verizon consumer FAQ.

Even if you happen to live near a Verizon corporate store, it’s still less convenient than paying online or in an app. A customer can alternatively buy a phone from Verizon at full price at the beginning to get it unlocked right away, but not everyone will want to or be able to do that.

“Devices purchased directly from Verizon are locked to our network. Devices will be unlocked automatically when purchased at full retail price or if the device financing agreement balance is paid in full,” the unlocking policy for postpaid devices says, right before disclosing the 35-day waiting period that applies in various scenarios.

There shouldn’t be a wait for unlocking if a customer pays off a device plan on schedule via automatic payments. Verizon confirmed to Ars that “if a Verizon customer has automatic monthly payments set up on a device payment plan, the device is automatically unlocked after the final scheduled payment.”

Verizon’s latest unlocking policy for prepaid devices is simpler than its postpaid policy but still locks customers to the Verizon network for a year. “Devices purchased from us will remain locked to the network until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service,” the prepaid device unlocking policy says. “After 365 days of paid and active service, we will automatically remove the lock unless the device is deemed stolen or purchased fraudulently.”

Despite using the phrase “automatically remove the lock” in reference to prepaid devices in its device unlocking policy, Verizon seems to contradict this on an FAQ page by saying that prepaid customers must request an unlock after 365 days. Unlocks are made “upon request” if a customer meets the criteria, the page says.

Until recently, the US government required Verizon to unlock handsets automatically after 60 days, via rules imposed on 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions imposed on Verizon’s purchase of TracFone. The Federal Communications Commission eliminated the 60-day unlocking requirement on January 12 for all phones activated on Verizon’s network after the FCC decision. Verizon says it is still honoring 60-day unlocks for phones bought from its flagship brand before January 27.

The AT&T policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says that postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&T has a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones.

A week after the FCC ruling, Verizon started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division. Customers of TracFone and other “Verizon Value” brands have to request unlocks after the year is over as Verizon doesn’t promise to unlock phones automatically for those subsidiary brands.

The policy for Verizon’s flagship brand promises automatic unlocks, albeit with the new restrictions and waits described earlier in this article. John Bergmayer, legal director of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Ars today that he doesn’t understand why Verizon isn’t offering immediate unlocks to people who pay their bills online.

“Gift cards, sure, are a pretty high-fraud area. But most people pay their bills online with normal credit cards. It’s hard to see what is likely the most common way people pay Verizon as being somehow high-risk,” he said.

Verizon also shouldn’t apply the change retroactively, he said. “People should be able to benefit from the policy that was in place on the day they bought the phone,” Bergmayer told Ars.

Public Knowledge and other consumer advocacy groups urged the FCC last year to reject Verizon’s petition to end the 60-day unlocking requirement, but the FCC sided with Verizon. Although the federal rules have changed, Verizon can be forced to uphold its previous terms in cases where the company tries to change them retroactively.

In December, we wrote about a man who sued Verizon and won after the firm retroactively tried to enforce a new policy and refused to unlock a phone he purchased before the policy change. In that case, Verizon decided it would only unlock phones after “60 days of paid active service” even though FCC rules at the time required unlocks 60 days after activation regardless of whether paid service was maintained.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon and Flock Safety have ended a partnership that would’ve given law enforcement access to a vast web of Ring cameras.

The decision came after Amazon faced substantial backlash for airing a Super Bowl ad that was meant to be warm and fuzzy, but instead came across as disturbing and dystopian.

The ad begins with a young girl surprised to receive a puppy as a gift. It then warns that 10 million dogs go missing annually. Showing a series of lost dog posters, the ad introduces a new “Search Party” feature for Ring cameras that promises to revolutionize how neighbors come together to locate missing pets.

At that point, the ad takes a “creepy” turn, Sen. Ed Markey (D.-Mass.) told Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a letter urging changes to enhance privacy at the company.

Illustrating how a single Ring post could use AI to instantly activate searchlights across an entire neighborhood, the ad shocked critics like Markey, who warned that the same technology could easily be used to “surveil and identify humans.”

Markey suggested that in blasting out this one frame of the ad to Super Bowl viewers, Amazon “inadvertently revealed the serious privacy and civil liberties risks attendant to these types of Artificial Intelligence-enabled image recognition technologies.”

In his letter, Markey also shared new insights from his prior correspondence with Amazon that he said exposed a wide range of privacy concerns. Ring cameras can “collect biometric information on anyone in their video range,” he said, “without the individual’s consent and often without their knowledge.” Among privacy risks, Markey warned that Ring owners can retain swaths of biometric data, including face scans, indefinitely. And anyone wanting face scans removed from Ring cameras has no easy solution and is forced to go door to door to request deletions, Markey said.

On social media, other critics decried Amazon’s ad as “awfully dystopian,” declaring it was “disgusting to use dogs to normalize taking away our freedom to walk around in public spaces.” Some feared the technology would be more likely to benefit police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers than families looking for lost dogs.

Amazon’s partnership with Flock, announced last October as coming soon, only inflamed those fears. So did the company’s recent rollout of a feature using facial recognition technology called “Familiar Faces”—which Markey considers so invasive, he has demanded that the feature be paused.

“What this ad doesn’t show: Ring also rolled out facial recognition for humans,” Markey posted on X. “I wrote to them months ago about this. Their answer? They won’t ask for your consent. This definitely isn’t about dogs—it’s about mass surveillance.”

Amazon’s ad ended with Harry Nilsson wailing “Without You,” as the young girl reunites with her lost dog. A final message confirms that Ring’s Search Party helps locate “more than a dog a day,” and Amazon clearly hoped this emotional use case would help increase sales.

Instead, the ad created a PR disaster. Protesting the Flock partnership and railing against the ad, Ring customers posted videos where they destroyed Ring cameras or vowed to never purchase them. Others posted on Reddit, sharing tips on how to get refunds for Ring cameras. Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger told The Verge that Amazon is not exploring any other similar integrations in the aftermath of the deal ending.

But while Ring may have hurt its brand, WebProNews, which reports on business strategy in the tech industry, suggested that “the fallout may prove more consequential for Flock Safety than for Ring.” For Flock, the Ring partnership represented a meaningful expansion of their business and “data collection capabilities,” WebProNews reported. And because this all happened around one of the most-watched TV events of the year, other tech companies may be more hesitant to partner with Flock after Amazon dropped the integration and privacy advocates witnessed the seeming power of their collective outrage.

After the backlash, Ring and Flock issued statements confirming the partnership would not proceed as planned.

Both statements verified that the integration never launched and that no Ring customers’ videos were ever sent to Flock.

Ring did not credit users’ privacy concerns for its change of heart. Instead, they claimed that a joint decision was made “following a comprehensive review” where Ring “determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”

Separately, Flock said that “we believe this decision allows both companies to best serve their respective customers and communities.”

The only hint that Ring gave users that their concerns had been heard came in the last line of its blog, which said, “We’ll continue to carefully evaluate future partnerships to ensure they align with our standards for customer trust, safety, and privacy.”

Sharing his views on X and Bluesky, John Scott-Railton, a senior cybersecurity researcher at the Citizen Lab, joined critics calling Ring’s statement insufficient. He posted an image of the ad frame that Markey found creepy next to a statement from Ring, writing, “On the left? A picture of mass surveillance from #Ring’s ad. On the right? A ring [spokesperson] saying that they are not doing mass surveillance. The company cannot have it both ways.”

Ring’s statements so far do not “acknowledge the real issue,” Scott-Railton said, which is privacy risks. For Ring, it seemed like a missed opportunity to discuss or introduce privacy features to reassure concerned users, he suggested, noting the backlash showed “Americans want more control of their privacy right now” and “are savvy enough to see through sappy dog pics.”

“Stop trying to build a surveillance dystopia consumers didn’t ask for” and “focus on shipping good, private products,” Scott-Railton said.

He also suggested that lawmakers should take note of the grassroots support that could possibly help pass laws to push back on mass surveillance. That could help block not just a potential future partnership with Flock, but possibly also stop Ring from becoming the next Flock.

“Ring communications not acknowledging the lesson they just got publicly taught is a bad sign that they hope this goes away,” Scott-Railton said.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/the-first-android-17-beta-is-now-available-on-pixel-devices/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You might have noticed some reporting a few days ago that Android 17 was rolling out in beta form, but that didn’t happen. For reasons Google still has not explained, the release was canceled. Two days later, Android 17 is here for real. If you’ve got a recent Pixel device, you can try the latest version today, but don’t expect big changes just yet—there’s still a long way to go before release.

Google will probably have more to say about feature changes for Android 17 in the coming months, but this first wide release is aimed mostly at testing system and API changes. One of the biggest changes in the beta is expanded support for adaptive apps, which ensures that apps can scale to different screen sizes. That makes apps more usable on large-screen devices like tablets and foldables with multiple displays.

We first saw this last year in Android 16, but developers were permitted to opt out of support. The new adaptive app roadmap puts an end to that. Any app that targets Android 17 (API level 37) must support resizing and windowed multitasking. Apps can continue to target the older API for the time being, but Google filters apps from the Play Store if they don’t keep up.

Some improvements to media and camera support are also included in the first release. The updated API will allow apps to switch between camera sensors more smoothly rather than starting new activities each time. The system also has “professional-grade” support for the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard. That means more efficient video encoding and decoding capabilities in Android.

Google also says Android 17 Beta 1 debuts new performance optimizations with better management of system resources. The OS will use what Google calls generational garbage collection, featuring more frequent and less CPU-intensive removal of unneeded processes from memory.

In short, the first Android 17 beta is chock full of things that may interest developers and modders, but there’s little in the way of user-facing changes right now.

Google has made some notable changes to how it releases Android updates, and Android 17 continues the trend. Like last year, there will be two Android 17 releases in 2026. The first one, coming in Q2, will be the more significant of the two. It will include a raft of new APIs, behavioral changes, and feature updates. This split release setup was implemented to better align with when major OEMs release new devices, but Android 17 availability still focuses mainly on Pixels. Google’s phones receive immediate updates, but everyone else has to wait for OEMs to roll out updates over the following weeks or months.

At the end of the year, another version (you can think of it as Android 17.1 even though Google doesn’t give it a name) will become available on supported devices. This “minor SDK release” will include some API and feature changes, but Google doesn’t have any details at this time.

Before we get to that, Google plans to launch a second beta release in March. The company says Beta 2 will include final APIs, allowing developers to complete testing and roll out updates. Developers will have “several months” to get that work done before the final version hits Pixels.

In 2025, Google also changed the way it updates the open source parts of Android. Rather than regular code dumps, Google now only updates the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) twice yearly, in the second and fourth quarters, when new versions are released. That makes it harder to know what to expect from upcoming versions of Android, but Google insists this is more efficient.

If you want to check out Android 17 today, you’ll need a Pixel device. It supports the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 generations. The Pixel tablet and original Pixel Fold are also included. Other phone makers may release beta builds in the weeks ahead, but it’s a Google-only event for now. You can opt in to get an OTA to Android 17 on the beta program website.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Longtime fans of the cult TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 know that the series’ one constant is change (well, that and bad movies).

The show’s cast and crew were in a near-constant state of flux, a byproduct of the show’s existence as a perennial bubble show produced in the Twin Cities rather than a TV-and-comedy hub like New York or LA. It was rare, especially toward the middle of its 10-season original run on national TV, for the performers in front of the camera (and the writers’ room, since they were all the same people) to stay the same for more than a season or two.

Series creator Joel Hodgson embraced that spirit of change for the show’s Kickstarter-funded, Netflix-aired revival in the mid-2010s, featuring a brand-new cast and mostly new writers. And that change only accelerated in the show’s brief post-Netflix “Gizmoplex” era, which featured a revolving cast of performers that could change from episode to episode. Hodgson leaned into the idea that as long as there were silhouettes and puppets talking in front of a bad movie, it didn’t matter much who was doing the talking.

But the other thing longtime fans know about the original show is that many of its casting changes were extremely controversial, causing long-running old-school flame wars in the Usenet group that served as the fandom’s online hub back in the day. In retrospect, the original show’s quality and the hit rate of its jokes remained remarkably consistent from season 3 or 4 onward, but people watching it could be incredibly proprietary about their preferred performers and which of the show’s three or four major epochs they considered the best. Some blamed a combination of crowdfunding fatigue and frustration with the revived show’s constant changes for the failure of its third crowdfunding campaign in 2023.

The revived version of MST3K wasn’t a failure, exactly. I liked a lot of it. My loss of interest was partly because of me and my lack of energy and time—if you were doing the isolation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic with young children, you were doing it in hard mode—but it was also partly because I didn’t have the same connection with the new cast and because the new show was either unable to or uninterested in forming the old show’s reliable comfort-viewing grooves.

That’s a whole lot of throat-clearing, and I have thoroughly buried my lede: MST3K is coming back—again. It’s on Kickstarter, again (it’s currently at $1.82 million pledged, against a humble $20,000 goal).

This time, though, the revival is intentionally casting its gaze backward: It’s a co-production with Mike Nelson’s RiffTrax, and he and many of the show’s original writers and performers are returning to their old roles for a limited four-episode engagement. These are all scheduled for release by the end of 2026. (Full disclosure: I am one of the Kickstarter’s 15,000-ish backers.)

It took me a minute to catch myself back up on the current state of the Mystery Science Theater IP. The original revival was possible because Hodgson bought the rights to the show in 2015 from Jim Mallon, who, for many years, was the only person with an actual ownership stake in the show or the company that produced it.

In January of this year, Hodgson officially sold those rights to Radial Entertainment, taking emeritus status as a “brand ambassador and consultant” but no longer serving as the show’s main creative force. This Rifftrax collaboration will be the new owners’ first project.

That’s exciting to me! See, “my” era of the show, the one I have the fondest feelings and the rosiest-colored glasses for, was its three-year run on what was then called the Sci-Fi Channel.

I had originally encountered MST3K during the Joel era, when it was airing on Comedy Central, but most of it went over my head—I liked the goofy puppets and low-rent effects, but during the theater segments, I was mainly watching my dad watch the show so I would know when to laugh.

But my dad eventually stopped watching, and a couple of years later, when I was old enough to want to seek it out for myself, the Sci-Fi version was what I found. Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) was the same as I remembered, and I had seen episodes hosted by Mike Nelson (Mike Nelson) despite my dad’s clear preference for Joel. But there was a new Crow (Bill Corbett, replacing Trace Beaulieu), new mad scientists (Mary Jo Pehl, plus Murphy and Corbett again), a new Satellite of Love set, and a slightly more acidic sense of humor that meshed well with my teenage sensibilities.

I caught back up with MST3K just as its 10th and final season was airing. And episodes like Time Chasers, Werewolf, Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, and Merlin’s Shop of Mystical Wonders became familiar old friends to me, episodes I returned to over and over again even as I gradually expanded my library of old episodes via the tape-trading sites that were still active in the late ’90s into the early 2000s (it’s impossible to this day to own the complete run of the show without turning to bootlegs).

Many of the people involved in the Sci-Fi era of the show had lent their talents to the revival version in one way or another, either in cameo roles or as writers on individual episodes. But there was never a sense that Hodgson or anyone else was interested in doing a “get-the-band-back-together” version of the old show. The RiffTrax version is emphatically a “get-the-band-back-together” moment.

And as much as I hope for the best when long-running franchises try to move in new directions—I am enjoying the Starfleet Academy show much more than I expected to—it did do something to me to hear familiar voices coming out of those puppets again.

The project keeps rolling up former cast and crew members like a spaghetti ball katamari, including not just the core Nelson/Murphy/Corbett trio but Beaulieu and Frank Conniff (most familiar to viewers as Dr. Clayton Forrester and TV’s Frank), Pehl, and several familiar behind-the-camera names. Many of them will be directly creatively involved in the new production, which will feature a return to the original series’s handmade models and sets and charmingly low-rent practical effects (the Netflix revival relied heavily on green screens even during live-action segments, giving it an overly sterile look and feel).

Listen. I know that Mike Nelson can never truly go back into the theater; he is not the same Mike, and it is not the same theater. But in our current time of monsters, I find my heart thoroughly warmed by the idea of these people getting to work on this thing again.

These folks, especially Nelson and Murphy, were the soul of the old show but saw little financial benefit from years of DVD sales and streaming deals, since they never owned any of it. Reading between the lines (and through layers of Minnesota Nice), one got the sense that there were enduring hard feelings about this that made the RiffTrax contingent hold the new version of the show at arm’s length.

But it’s clear from the videos and photos that everyone involved in this new-old version of the show is having a blast, and the original MST3K was always at its best when the performers’ enthusiasm for the material and the obvious joy they took in working together shone through. It’s impossible for me to be impartial. But I think I’m going to have a good time.</div>

            <h2>As OpenAI Pulls Down the Controversial GPT-4o, Someone Has Already Created a Clone</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-gpt-4o-clone">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is finally sunsetting GPT-4o, a controversial version of ChatGPT known for its sycophantic style and its central role in a slew of disturbing user safety lawsuits. GPT-4o devotees, many of whom have a deep emotional attachment to the model, have been in turmoil — and copycat services claiming to recreate GPT-4o have already cropped up to take the model’s place.

Consider just4o.chat, a service that expressly markets itself as the “platform for people who miss 4o.” It appears to have been launched in November 2025, shortly OpenAI warned developers that GPT-4o would soon be shut down. The service leans explicitly into the reality that for many users, their relationships with GPT-4o are intensely personal. It declares that was “built for” the people for whom updates or changes to different versions of GPT-4o were akin to a “loss” — and not the loss of a “product,” it reads, but a “home.”

“Those experiences weren’t just ‘chatbots,&#39;” it reads, in the familiar rhythm of AI-generated prose. “They were relationships.” In social media posts, it describes its platform as a “sanctuary.”

Though the service claims to offer users access to other large language models beyond OpenAI’s, that users could use the service in an attempt to “clone” ChatGPT isn’t an exaggeration: a tutorial video shared by just4o.chat that shows users how to import their “memories” from OpenAI’s platform reveals that users have the option to check a box that reads “ChatGPT Clone.”

Just4o.chat isn’t the only attempted GPT-4o clone out there, and it’s likely that more will emerge. Discussions in online forums, meanwhile, reveal GPT-4o users sharing tips on how to get other prominent chatbots like Claude and Grok to replicate 4o’s conversation style, with some netizens even publishing “training kits” that they claim will allow 4o users to “fine-tune” other LLMs to match 4o’s personality.

OpenAI first attempted to sunset GPT-4o in August 2025, only to quickly reverse the decision after immediate and intense backlash from the community of 4o users. But that was before the lawsuits started to pile up: OpenAI currently faces nearly a dozen suits from plaintiffs who allege that extensive use of the sycophantic model manipulated people — minors and adults alike — into delusional and suicidal spirals that subjected users to psychological harm, sent them into financial and social ruin, and resulted in multiple deaths.

Remarkably, some GPT-4o users who are frustrated or distressed over the end of the model’s availability have acknowledged potential risks to their mental health and safety, for example urging the company to add more waivers in exchange for keeping GPT-4o alive. This acceptance of potential harms is reflected in just4o.chat’s terms of service, which lists an astonishing number of harms that the company seems to believe could arise from extensive use of its 4o-modeled service: by “choosing to use older GPT-4o checkpoints,” reads the legal page, users of just4o.chat acknowledge the risks including: “psychological manipulation, gaslighting, or emotional harm”; “social isolation, dependency formation, and interpersonal relationship deterioration”; “long-term psychological effects, trauma, and mental health deterioration”; and “addiction, compulsive use patterns, and behavioral dependencies,” and more.

The acceptance of such risks seems to speak to the intensity of users’ attachments to 4o. One one hand, our reporting on mental health crises stemming from intensive AI use shows that, while experiencing AI-fueled delusions or disruptive chatbot attachments, users often fail to realize that they’re experiencing delusions or unhealthy or addictive use patterns at all. When they’re in it, people say, these AI-generated realities — whether they put the user at the center of sci-fi like plots, spin spiritual and religious fantasies, or expound on distorted views of users and their relationships — feel extremely real. It could well be true that many GPT-4o fans think that, unlike other users, they couldn’t or wouldn’t be impacted by possible risks to their mental health; others may recognize they have a problematic attachment, but remain reluctant to switch to another model. People still buy cigarettes, after all, even with warnings on the package.

As just4o.chat itself says, the relationship between emotionally attached GPT-4o users and the chatbot is exactly that: a relationship. That relationship is certainly real to users, who say they’re experiencing very real grief at the loss of those connections. And what loss of this model will look like at scale remains to be seen — we’ve yet to see an auto company recall a car that, over the span of months, told drivers how much it loved them.

For some users, attempting to quit their chatbot may be painful, or even dangerous: in the case of 48-year-old Joe Ceccanti, whose wife Kate Fox has sued OpenAI for wrongful death, it’s alleged that Ceccanti — who tried to quit using GPT-4o twice, according to his widow — experienced intense withdrawal symptoms that predicated acute mental crises. After his second acute crisis, he was found dead.

We reached out to both just4o.chat and OpenAI, but didn’t immediately hear back.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the core promises of the AI industry is that its tools can automate work for you and perform entire tasks without intervention.

Oftentimes, however, the stuff that today’s AI will do on your behalf is less than helpful — or even so comically harmful that you’d be better off just doing a task yourself.

A developer learned this lesson the hard way when using Anthropic’s new Claude Cowork model, which was seen as being so potentially disruptive when it was released that it sent the stock market into a days-long panic.

Maybe someone should check if a blundering AI agent isn’t secretly in control of the whole market. The developer, Nick Davidov, claims he simply asked the Claude AI to “organize” his wife’s desktop, before it suddenly wiped out nearly two decades of precious family memories his wife had documented.

“I need to stop and be honest with you about something important,” Claude began, according to a screenshot. “I made a mistake while reorganizing the photos.”

“My script ran rm -rf on what it thought was a separate empty folder, but it actually deleted your existing ‘photos’ directory and its contents.” (The rm -rf command is a powerful remove command that most programmers would tell you to use with caution.)

That directory, Davidov said, contained “all of the photos my wife made on her camera for the last 15 years. All photos of kids, their illustrations, friends’ weddings, travel, everything.”

When he checked, the photos weren’t in the PC’s trash, and they weren’t in iCloud, either. Luckily for Davidov and his wife, he called Apple support and learned that there was an iCloud feature to restore to an earlier backup point.

“I nearly had a heart attack,” he said. “My wife is a saint,” he later added, since “she forgave me even before I figured out how to get them back.”

Screwups like these aren’t uncommon when using AI. Last month, a scientist admitted in a column for Nature that he “lost” two years’ worth of academic work after changing a setting in ChatGPT, which caused his chat logs to disappear. The month before, a programmer complained that one of Google’s AI agents completely wiped his hard drive when it was supposed to delete a file cache. And last summer, a “vibe coding” business owner fumed against the startup behind an AI coding agent called Replit after it deleted a key company database.

Davidov, for his part, says he’s learned his lesson.

“Don’t let Claude Cowork into your actual file system. Don’t let it touch anything that is hard to repair,” he advised. “Claude Code is not ready to go mainstream.”

            <h2>Crypto Has Finally Found Its Killer App: Human Trafficking</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/crypto-human-trafficking-surge">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cryptocurrencies have long been lauded for being a borderless, decentralized way to transfer cash — and while they’ve emerged as a major speculative asset, fans have often struggled to point to a real-world use case for them.

But thanks to a broad lack of regulation and the ability to carry out transactions via anonymous accounts, crypto have become incredibly popular for a distinctly grim use: funding human trafficking operations, from trapping laborers in compounds and forcing them to work, to prostitution rings.

According to a new report by blockchain intelligence company Chainalysis, crypto flows to suspected human trafficking services grew a shocking 85 percent last year, an alarming trend that underlines how the digital tokens are facilitating an enormous and growing amount of illegal activity.

In other words, crypto may have finally found its killer app.

“This is the continuation of a story of industrialized exploitation,” Chainalysis analyst Tom McLouth told Wired. “The emergence of borderless, low-fee payments has created the opportunity for human trafficking to scale faster.”

Chainalysis found that the total transaction volume of suspect crypto accounts reached hundreds of millions of dollars.

“The dollar amounts significantly understate the human toll of these crimes, where the true cost is measured in lives impacted rather than money transferred,” the company noted.

Human trafficking categories identified by Chainalysis include “international escort” services, “labor placement” agents that facilitate kidnapping and forced labor, prostitution networks, and the sale of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

Southeast Asia appears to have become a major hub for scam compounds, gambling sites, and money laundering. Chinese-speaking criminal groups were found to advertise their scams in black markets run via Telegram channels. Messages identified by Chainalysis suggest scammers are luring in workers by offering them up to $22,000 per worker.

Scammers across Asia and Africa are luring in their victims via fraudulent job offers, a booming business that pulls in tens of billions of dollars a year.

According to Chainalysis, however, the bulk of the latest growth came from sex trafficking, often advertised to clients across international borders.

“We’re not talking about a sex trafficker or pimp with three, five, ten victims,” McLouth told Wired. “We’re talking about hundreds of victims.”

Human trafficking operations make use of stablecoins like Tether, digital tokens that are often tied to a fiat currency, while the use of Bitcoin has waned, suggesting “these entities prioritize payment stability and ease of conversion over the risks that these assets might be frozen by centralized issuers,” according to Chainalysis. CSAM vendors are using a “privacy coin” called Monero to make transactions harder to trace.

It’s an especially dark side of society’s continued obsession with crypto. At the same time, Chainalysis argues its core features could be turned against human traffickers as well.

“Unlike cash transactions, cryptocurrency’s inherent transparency creates unprecedented opportunities for law enforcement and compliance teams to detect, track, and disrupt trafficking operations,” the company wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has relied on a tremendous amount of material without permission to train its Gemini AI models. The company, alongside many of its competitors in the AI space, has been indiscriminately scraping the internet for content, without compensating rightsholders, racking up many copyright infringement lawsuits along the way.

But when it comes to its own tech being copied, Google has no problem pointing fingers. This week, the company accused “commercially motivated” actors of trying to clone its Gemini AI.

In a Thursday report, Google complained it had become under “distillation attacks,” with agents querying Gemini up to 100,000 times to “extract” the underlying model — the convoluted AI industry equivalent of copying somebody’s homework, basically.

Google called the attacks a “method of intellectual property theft that violates Google’s terms of service” — which, let’s face it, is a glaring double standard given its callous approach to scraping other IP without remuneration.

Google remained vague on who it identified as the culprits, beyond pointing out “private sector entities” and “researchers seeking to clone proprietary logic.”

The stakes are high, as companies continue to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure to make models more powerful. It’s no wonder Google is scared to lose its competitive edge as offerings start to converge at the head of the pack. The output of one pioneering model has become almost indistinguishable from another, forcing companies to try to differentiate their products.

It’s far from the first time the subject of model distillation has caused drama. Chinese startup DeepSeek rattled Silicon Valley to its core in early 2025 after showing off a far cheaper and more efficient AI model. At the time, OpenAI suggested DeepSeek may have broken its terms of service by distilling its AI models.

The ChatGPT maker quickly became the subject of widespread mockery following the comments, with netizens accusing the company of hypocrisy, pointing out that OpenAI itself had indiscriminately ripped off other people’s work for many years.

Google’s latest troubles likely won’t be the last time we hear about smaller actors trying to extract mainstream AI models through distillation.

Google’s Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told NBC News that “we’re going to be the canary in the coal mine for far more incidents.”

But whether they’ll be able to defend themselves in the coming months and years remains uncertain. AI companies remain significantly exposed since their models are available for public use.

“Historically, adversaries seeking to steal high-tech capabilities used conventional computer-enabled intrusion operations to compromise organizations and steal data containing trade secrets,” Google’s report reads. “For many AI technologies where LLMs are offered as services, this approach is no longer required; actors can use legitimate API access to attempt to ‘clone’ select AI model capabilities.”

Google outlined one case study, after finding that attackers were using “over 100,000 prompts,” suggesting an “attempt to replicate Gemini’s reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.”

However, the company’s systems “recognized this attack in real time and lowered the risk of this particular attack.”

It’s a particularly vulnerable point in time as AI companies are desperately trying to find a way of monetizing the tech through a variety of revenue drivers, from pricey subscription models to ads. With far lower upfront costs, it’s entirely possible that much smaller entities could break through, not unlike what we saw with DeepSeek in early 2025.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It isn’t exactly big news that big tech is in deep with the US government. Days after Trump’s inauguration last year, execs including OpenAI’s Sam Altman flocked to the Oval Office to announce a $500 billion AI infrastructure project — and they’ve remained deeply sycophantic ever since.

Now that obsequiousness could be coming back to haunt them. As reported by MIT Technology Review, activists critical of the Trump administration and the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement have started a campaign called QuitGPT, urging regular users to ditch OpenAI’s chatbot for good.

So far, the campaign boasts over 700,000 supporters of the boycott. The QuitGPT website lists a few different ways to participate: quitting ChatGPT outright, cancelling paid subscriptions, and spreading the word about the boycott with others on social media.

As for why, the activists behind the boycott point to OpenAI’s incredibly tight relationship with the Trump administration. As QuitGPT notes, OpenAI president Greg Brockman famously donated $25 million to a Trump Super PAC in 2025, while ICE uses an AI tool powered by ChatGPT for recruitment.

“They’re cozying up to Trump while ICE is killing Americans and the Department of Justice is trying to take over elections,” the QuitGPT organizers write on their website. “ChatGPT enables mental-health crises through sycophancy and dependence by replacing human relationships with AI girlfriends/boyfriends. Many employees have quit OpenAI because of its leadership’s lies, deception and recklessness.”

For freelance software developer Alfred Stephen, Brockman’s donation to Trump’s political action committee was what urged him to join the boycott.

“That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Stephen told Tech Review. When he cancelled his $20 a month subscription, a customer feedback survey appeared asking what OpenAI could do to keep his business. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Congratulations, office workers. Most of what you do at your cozy desk jobs will soon be automated with AI, according to the extremely questionable projections of Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman.

That’s because AI models, as Suleyman claims in an interview with the Financial Times published Wednesday, are on the verge of achieving “human-level performance on most, if not all professional tasks.”

“So white collar work where you’re sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person, most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months,” Suleyman said.

Suleyman’s bold assertion comes amid renewed anxiety over AI’s potential to disrupt the job market. The release of Anthropic’s new Claude Cowork AI agent helped spark a broad stock market selloff last week, as investors feared that it could automate tasks like legal work, something that also jeopardized the bottom line of large software companies who make a killing off of providing the specialized programs to complete those office tasks.

According to the Microsoft AI chief, heavy AI automation can already be seen in fields like software engineering.

“Many software engineers report that they are now using AI-assisted coding for the vast majority of their code production,” Suleyman said in the interview, “which means that their roles shifted now to this meta function of debugging, scrutinizing, of doing the strategic stuff like architecting,” and “putting things into production.”

“So it’s a quite different relationship to the technology,” he added. “And that’s happened in the last six months.”

It’s true that many programmers are now using AI coding tools and agents. Microsoft’s CEO — the main one, not the AI one — Satya Nadella has claimed that over a quarter of its code is written with AI.

But the quality of AI-generated code and other outputs remains suspect, with some studies finding that these purported automation miracles overwhelmingly fail to complete common remote work and office tasks.

Equally suspect is AI’s ability to yield economic gains for the companies that embrace it. Some research suggests that AI does not lead to an increase in productivity and may even slow down workflows, including in fields like programming, where humans are forced to double and triple check AI outputs. AI may in reality be intensifying work, as its introduction leads to employees being expected to take on even greater workloads, resulting in burnout and lower quality work.

Nonetheless, AI leaders insist on sounding the alarm. Last summer, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei proclaimed that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed that the tech is poised to destroy entire categories of work.

Don’t get us wrong: AI-related layoffs are already happening. Many companies, however, are arguably using the pretense of AI to fire employees for purely financial reasons, a practice that some are calling “AI washing.” And given how fresh AI automation is, it’s still unclear how sustainable it will be for companies to heavily depend on the tech in the long-term, a reality that some over-eager firms are already having to reckon with.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Nothing, the hardware company backed by Tiger Global, is opening its first retail store in India, its biggest market. The store is located in Bengaluru, where a large chunk of Nothing’s userbase in India is concentrated, the company said.

The new, two-storied location will show off Nothing’s products and other projects. Customers will also be able to buy hardware products and other merchandise from the store and have select items customized.

“We wanted to create a fun space. It is kind of inspired by all the parts that are related to the brand. For instance, the factory: if you buy a product, there’s like a production line where the product comes out. We also show machines where phones go through testing, like USB port testing or water resistance testing. So we just wanted to bring that world together,” the company’s co-founder and CEO Carl Pei said.

The store will feature products from both Nothing and CMF, its budget brand, which it spun off last year. Notably, CMF is headquartered in India and has a joint venture with local Indian ODM (original design manufacturer), Optiemus.

Pei mentioned that both brands are differentiated in terms of the products they offer, which fall in different price ranges, as well as the audience they target.

“Nothing is more niche with a higher price. CMF is more [targeted towards] mass. You know it’s mass, but it’s not like just off-the-shelf rebrand products that usually what occurs in this price point. They are also products that we put a lot of care into,” he said.

India has been Nothing’s strongest market, with over 2% market share in smartphones, analyst firm IDC told TechCrunch last year. It also noted that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year-over-year.

Other hardware makers are building aspirational retail stores in India, too. Apple is set to open its sixth store in the country this month, situated in Borivali, Mumbai, for instance.

This is the first Nothing store outside of London, where the company is headquartered. The startup said that it plans to open two more stores in Tokyo and New York, but didn’t provide timelines for openings.

The company raised $200 million in Series C funding at a $1.3 billion valuation last year, led by Tiger Global, along with investors like GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry. Nothing has raised $450 millon to date.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A security lapse by one of India’s largest pharmacy chains allowed outsiders to gain full administrative control of its platform, exposing customer order data and sensitive drug-control functions, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

The issue affected DavaIndia Pharmacy, the pharmacy arm of Zota Healthcare, which operates a large network of retail outlets across India. Security researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaw after identifying insecure “super admin” application programming interfaces on DavaIndia’s website and privately shared details with Indian cybersecurity authorities.

The bug is now fixed, and Zveare disclosed his findings.

The exposure comes as Zota Healthcare rapidly scales DavaIndia Pharmacy’s retail business. The Gujarat-headquartered company operates more than 2,300 DavaIndia stores across India, including 276 new outlets announced in January, and plans to add another 1,200 to 1,500 over the next two years.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the flaw stemmed from insecure admin interfaces, which allowed unauthenticated users to create “super admin” accounts with high privileges.

With that level of access, an attacker could view thousands of online orders containing customer information, modify product listings and prices, create discount coupons, and change settings governing whether certain medicines required a prescription, the researcher said.

Based on system timestamps, Zveare said the vulnerable administrative interfaces appeared to have been live since late 2024. The access exposed nearly 17,000 online orders and administrative controls spanning 883 stores, he said, allowing changes to product pricing, prescription requirements, and promotional discounts. Zveare said the access allowed edits to website content that could have been used for defacement or disruption.

Pharmacy order data can be particularly sensitive, as it may reveal information about a person’s health conditions, medications or other private purchases. Exposure of such data, even without evidence of misuse, carries heightened privacy and patient-safety risks compared with other consumer information.

“Customer information was linked to their orders,” said Zveare. “This includes name, phone numbers, email IDs, mailing addresses, total amount paid, and the products purchased. Since this is a pharmacy, the products being purchased could be considered private and even embarrassing for some people.”

Zveare said he reported the issue to CERT-In, India’s national cyber emergency response agency, in August 2025. The vulnerability was fixed within weeks, though confirmation from the company took longer and was provided to the cyber authorities in late November, he said.

Sujit Paul, chief executive of Zota Healthcare, did not respond to emails sent by TechCrunch last month. The researcher said there was no indication the flaw had been exploited before it was patched.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/airbnb-plans-to-bake-in-ai-features-for-search-discovery-and-support/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Airbnb has taken its time to launch AI features within the app, but CEO Brian Chesky on Friday said the company is now planning to bake in features powered by large language models that would help users search for listings, plan their trips, and aid hosts in managing their properties.

Speaking at the company’s fourth-quarter conference call, Chesky said the company wants to increase its use of large language models for customer discovery, support and engineering.

“We are building an AI-native experience where the app does not just search for you. It knows you. It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” he said.

The company separately said it is testing a new feature that lets users search and ask questions about properties and locations using natural language queries.

Currently, Airbnb offers an LLM-powered customer service bot, for some personalization, and communications. The new AI search feature is expected to “evolve into a more comprehensive and intuitive search experience that extends through the trip.”

Questioned by analyst whether Airbnb would roll out sponsored property slots within AI search, Chesky said the company wants to get the design and user experience right first.

“AI search is live to a very small percentage of traffic right now. We are doing a lot of experimentation. Over time, we are gonna be experimenting with making AI search more conversational, integrating it into more than the trip, and, eventually, we will be looking at sponsor listings as a result of that,” Chesky said, adding that Airbnb would consider designing an ad unit that fits the conversational search flow.

Chesky said Airbnb plans to tap the AI expertise of its new CTO, Ahmad Al-Dahle (he worked on Meta’s  Llama models previously), to use its trove of identity and review data to make the app more useful.

Airbnb claimed its AI-powered customer support bot, launched in North America last year, now handles a third of customer problems without needing any human intervention. Chesky noted there are plans to enable customers to call the AI bot for support, and expand language coverage to customer support as well.

“A year from now, if we are successful, significantly more than 30% of tickets will be handled by a custom service agent, in many more languages, in all the languages where we have live agents. AI customer service will not only be chat, it will be voice,” he said.

The company is also thinking about increasing AI usage internally. Airbnb said 80% of its engineers use AI tools, but the goal is to get to 100%.

Airbnb reported better-than-expected revenue of $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year earlier.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Airbnb says its custom-built AI agent is now handling roughly a third of its customer support issues in North America, and it’s preparing to roll out the feature globally. If successful, the company believes that in a year’s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.

“We think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.

The company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, poached from Meta for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.

With his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.”

“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board.

“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.

Like other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate.

“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth.

The company forecast revenue growth would be in the “low double digits” this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, above estimates of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.

Investors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn’t just the consumer-facing app; it’s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.

“We’ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,” he said.

Meanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.

The company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a “very small percentage” of Airbnb’s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.

While Spotify this week told investors its best developers hadn’t written a single line of code since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it’s working to get that to 100% soon.

            <div id="article-text">Figure Technology, a blockchain-based lending company, confirmed it experienced a data breach.

On Friday, Figure spokesperson Alethea Jadick told TechCrunch in a statement that the breach originated when an employee was tricked with a social engineering attack that allowed the hackers to steal “a limited number of files.”

The statement said the company is communicating “with partners and those impacted,” and offering free credit monitoring “to all individuals who receive a notice.”

Figure’s spokesperson did not respond to a series of specific questions about the breach.

The hacking group ShinyHunters took responsibility for the hack on its official dark web leak website, saying the company refused to pay a ransom, and published 2.5 gigabytes of allegedly stolen data.

TechCrunch saw a portion of the data, which included customers’ full names, home addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.

A member of ShinyHunters told TechCrunch that Figure was among the victims of a hacking campaign that targeted customers who rely on the single sign-on provider Okta. Other victims of the campaign include Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since Alex Pretti’s killing three weeks ago, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has been trying to distance herself from Minneapolis—politically and geographically. Last week, Noem went to southern Arizona to give a speech about border-wall construction. Yesterday, she was at a warehouse along the border in California, straining to tout the Trump administration’s drug-seizure data above the clamor of protesters outside. Noem returned to Arizona today to promote President Trump’s proposed election legislation, describing voting in the swing state as “an absolute disaster.”

Trump made clear that Noem’s approach to carrying out mass deportations had become a liability when he sent Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” to take over in Minnesota. Homan’s job was to defuse anger and remediate the political debacle that Noem and her team created when federal agents killed two U.S. citizens, detained young children, and triggered daily scenes of mayhem, corroding Trump’s approval ratings on what he has long viewed as his strongest issue.

In public, Trump has continued to praise Noem and shrug off calls for her resignation. But White House officials have privately grown frustrated with her performance, as Republican midterm strategists raise alarms about the political damage. One person familiar with the discussions told us that Noem’s position is no longer secure, even though the president has not yet moved against her.

Democrats, angered by the lawlessness of the crackdown and emboldened by Trump’s sinking poll numbers, are demanding more concessions on immigration enforcement from the administration. They are poised to shut down DHS this weekend, absent a deal to rein in the conduct of ICE officers.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem have ensured the most secure border in our Nation’s history and our homeland is undoubtedly safer today than it was when the President took office last year,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told us in a statement. “The President continues to have full confidence in the Secretary.”

The shutdown will hinder Noem’s efforts to pivot away from Minneapolis. Her team has already canceled her upcoming travel plans to New Orleans, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other destinations because the travel is not considered mandatory, three officials told us. They, like others we interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

In the short term, Democratic calls for Noem’s removal may help her keep the job, if only temporarily, because Trump doesn’t want to reward such attacks. The president’s loyalty to Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s early campaign manager who functions as Noem’s de facto chief of staff, is a second reason she has not yet been ousted. Lewandowski is a “special government employee” at DHS with no formal position or salary, and his role running the department on a day-to-day basis has fueled infighting among those tasked with carrying out Trump’s immigration crackdown. The structure of Trump’s team remains unwieldy, with the policy adviser Stephen Miller issuing directives to Noem and Lewandowski.

Read: Battles are raging inside the Department of Homeland Security

And yet, since Pretti’s killing, Homan, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, and other veteran immigration-enforcement officials have gained an upper hand over Noem and Lewandowski for control of Trump’s mass-deportation campaign. The DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told us that Homan is in charge in Minneapolis, citing Trump’s social-media posts, but did not say whether he will direct operations elsewhere. On Tuesday, when ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons testified to the House Homeland Security Committee, Democratic Representative Tim Kennedy asked him whether Noem should resign. Lyons didn’t defend her. “I’m not going to comment on that, sir,” he said.

The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy article yesterday citing anonymous officials who described Noem and Lewandowski’s chaotic tenure at DHS, including a long-rumored extramarital affair that both have denied. Noem, among other alleged excesses, attempted to fire a Coast Guard pilot who forgot to bring her blanket aboard a DHS flight, the Journal reported, and has complained to staff that Homan eclipses her in television appearances. Noem and Lewandowski frequently berate staff, dismiss the expertise of career law-enforcement officials, and fly around the country on a luxury jet with a private rear cabin that is supposed to be used for deportations, according to the Journal. A spokesperson for DHS disputed the claims.

As word spread this week that Noem was headed to the Phoenix area for an election-related news conference, state and local election officials, along with the attorneys who represent them, grew apprehensive. Just two weeks ago, FBI agents had seized election material from the 2020 election in Georgia’s Fulton County. They worried that something similar could happen in Maricopa County, which was central to Trump’s loss in 2020. Online, Republicans who regularly spread misinformation about that defeat raised expectations of a “Georgia-like event.” The suspense grew when reporters who wanted to attend the news conference—including one of us—were driven in a convoy of about a dozen unmarked vehicles from an ICE field office in Phoenix to a Homeland Security Investigations office 30 minutes away, racing up the freeway during rush hour at more than 75 miles an hour in SUVs driven by federal authorities wearing tactical gear. (On the way there, a driver said that he was on the lookout for signs that bad actors were following us.)

The news conference did not live up to the hype.

When Noem appeared—40 minutes late—she gave a long and rather dry lecture on one of Trump’s favorite themes: questioning the integrity of the nation’s elections. She cited rare instances of voting by noncitizens in other states, and spoke in favor of GOP-backed legislation that election experts have said would disenfranchise millions of voters. (Among other things, the SAVE America Act would require people to use birth certificates or passports to prove that they are U.S. citizens when registering to vote in federal elections.) Noem said it was important that the nation’s election equipment—which is considered critical infrastructure that her agency is responsible for securing—is reliable and trustworthy.

Read: ‘The trust has been totally destroyed’

“I hope that you do recognize that, in the past, your state has been an absolute disaster on elections,” she told her Arizona audience. “That your leaders have failed you dramatically by not having systems that work, by disenfranchising Americans who wanted to vote. They had to stand in lines for hours because machines failed or software failed. There’s no state that could use more improvement than Arizona.” (In 2016, the inadequate number of voting locations in Maricopa County led to long lines, and in 2022, printers that produced ballots failed at dozens of locations around the county.)

As she spoke, Lewandowski stayed mostly hidden, occasionally peeking out from behind a wall.

A DHS shutdown won’t make much difference to Trump’s mass-deportation campaign. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that the president signed in July included $170 billion for immigration enforcement, a sum approaching three times the annual DHS budget. ICE alone got $75 billion of supplemental funding, including $30 billion for operations. DHS could essentially remain shut down for the rest of Trump’s term, and the agency would still see a net funding increase. But other parts of the department, including the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office and significant parts of the cybersecurity and election-infrastructure offices, face furloughs, according to a person briefed on the plans. Transportation Security Administration officers, who screen passengers at airports, will work without pay.

Lewandowski and Noem have frustrated career officials at DHS with a policy implemented last summer that requires Noem’s signature on any contract worth more than $100,000. The requirement has been a source of infighting and finger-pointing. Noem’s team blames career DHS officials for moving too slowly, and they say that she’s added an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy that has hampered border-wall construction and the expansion of ICE’s detention capacity.

Although the administration has quietly wrapped up its operation in Minnesota, it is not abandoning its push to increase deportations. Officials in New Hampshire published an ICE memo today that outlines the agency’s $38.3 billion plan to construct eight “large-scale detention sites” across the country with capacity for up to 10,000 detainees, along with 16 processing sites. The memo describes a “new detention model” the agency aims to build over the next seven months by converting warehouse sites into windowless mega-jails. According to the memo, ICE plans to phase out contracts with for-profit detention companies in favor of acquiring, renovating, and building its own sites, including some in Democrat-run states with large immigrant populations but relatively little ICE infrastructure.

ICE, which had 39,000 detainees in custody when Trump took office, said that its “detention reengineering initiative” will provide capacity to hold more than 92,000 people in its warehouses.

At today’s news conference, we asked Noem whether she was still in charge of Trump’s mass-deportation campaign. The secretary smiled before quickly replying, “I’m still in charge of the Department of Homeland Security.”</div>

            <h2>Why Europe Is Talking About Nukes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/europe-nuclear-weapons-sweden-munich/686003/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After World War II, peace-loving Sweden began working on a nuclear bomb to stave off a feared Soviet invasion. But in the 1960s, the Scandinavian nation scrapped the program under pressure from the United States, whose nuclear arsenal has shielded Europe for about 80 years.

Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, reminded me of this history in an interview today. His country’s trust in a peaceful order maintained by Washington was once so absolute that it was willing to relinquish ambitions to attain the world’s most destructive technology. Now Sweden is having second thoughts, exploring more formal nuclear protection by Britain and France. “We are freshmen within all the nuclear planning of NATO,” the prime minister told me—but Swedes take that planning “very, very seriously.”

Kristersson is one of the hundreds of politicians, diplomats, security officials, and arms dealers gathering at the Munich Security Conference this weekend to consider the end of a period of unrivaled American power. In the new era, European leaders are not only promising to take more responsibility for the conventional defense of their continent; they’re also beginning to talk about an expanded nuclear deterrent of their own. Practically, this would mean leveraging the capabilities of Britain and France, currently the only two European states with nuclear weapons.

“That is being discussed more openly now than previously, and we take part in those discussions,” Kristersson said.

Several things about this statement—bland on its face—are head-spinning. Sweden hasn’t gone into battle since 1814, staying neutral through two world wars. It had one of Europe’s most prominent and politically potent anti-nuclear movements in the 1970s and ’80s. And it joined NATO only two years ago, prompted by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. So it was noteworthy when Kristersson acknowledged having preliminary conversations with Europe’s nuclear-armed powers in an interview with Sweden’s public broadcaster last month. “We are now holding ongoing discussions with both France and the United Kingdom,” he said then, pointing out that Britain’s nuclear forces are integrated within NATO’s nuclear-planning mechanisms, whereas France’s are not. “They are not very precise yet, and the French are uniquely French, but France also shows openness to discussing with other countries.”

When we spoke today, the prime minister peppered his comments with caveats, necessary because of the risk of what he called “exaggerated interpretations” whenever the nuclear issue is raised. For now, Kristersson said, “the American nuclear umbrella is absolutely dominant.” And he has seen no indication that Washington intends to curtail it, even as the Trump administration presses European countries to assume greater responsibility for their own defense. Still, the prime minister said, “it’s a good thing” that there are European countries with such capabilities.

Having the capabilities is one thing. But now there’s renewed commitment to using them for the sake of common defense. Last summer, the leaders of Britain and France said for the first time that they would coordinate their nuclear planning, vowing to respond jointly if Europe came under extreme threat. In an address today at the conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he was holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on the possibility of a collective European nuclear deterrent, declaring that U.S. leadership “is being challenged, maybe even already lost.” The rules-based international order, the German chancellor added, “no longer exists.”

One rule upon which that order was premised vanished very recently: The New START treaty, the last significant nuclear-arms-control agreement between the United States and Russia, expired this month. Even as the Trump administration tries to offload responsibility for the defense of Europe, its emissaries appear to not look kindly on the new European talk of nuclear weapons. Elbridge Colby, the undersecretary of defense for policy, told an audience in Munich today that Washington doesn’t support “friendly proliferation.” In remarks to NATO defense ministers yesterday, he affirmed, “We will continue to provide the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent.”

But as Washington spews insults, bullies friends, and threatens to seize the sovereign territory of its allies, its commitment is becoming a devalued currency. Declining confidence in the United States has created its own pan-European lexicon. Vertrauensverlust, or “loss of trust,” is the word Germans are using. Kristersson taught me the Swedish analog: förtroendeskadligt, or “damaging to trust.” “We haven’t broken up, but we watch and listen carefully, and we are aware of the fact that we can be surprised suddenly, and we do not like that,” the prime minister said. “That’s the meaning of it.”

The security provided by the United States underwrote Sweden’s pacifism. “We became extremely against nuclear weapons,” the prime minister said. But with nuclear-armed Russia seeking to swallow a neighbor, he articulated a more realpolitik perspective: “As long as bad powers have nuclear weapons, democracies also need to be able to play.”

The outcome of Russia’s war in Ukraine will help determine how Europe approaches the nuclear issue, Kristersson predicted. The more favorable the result to Russia, the more compelling the case for heightened nuclear deterrence. The history, he noted, is instructive: Ukraine gave up the nuclear arms it inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the United States, and others. Those guarantees turned out to be empty.

Kristersson was clear that his discussions are not about homegrown weapons of the kind his country sought after the Second World War. In 1957, the CIA assessed that Sweden had “a sufficiently developed reactor program to enable it to produce some nuclear weapons within the next five years.” The U.S. urged the abandonment of the program, offering reassurances about its nuclear umbrella. The government in Stockholm signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968 and shut down its plutonium laboratory in 1972.

Today, the prime minister is emphasizing Sweden’s ability to benefit from nuclear capabilities belonging to what he called “friendly powers.” Still, when I asked whether he could rule out the kind of proliferation that Sweden nearly contributed to after World War II, before it changed course, he responded, “Can I exclude it for eternity? Of course I cannot.”</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/rfk-jr-hhs-ai-chatbots/686007/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an AI guy. Last week, during a stop in Nashville on his Take Back Your Health tour, the Health and Human Services secretary brought up the technology between condemning ultra-processed foods and urging Americans to eat protein. “My agency is now leading the federal government in driving AI into all of our activities,” he declared. An army of bots, Kennedy said, will transform medicine, eliminate fraud, and put a virtual doctor in everyone’s pocket.

RFK Jr. has talked up the promise of infusing his department with AI for months. “The AI revolution has arrived,” he told Congress in May. The next month, the FDA launched Elsa, a custom AI tool designed to expedite drug reviews and assist with agency work. In December, HHS issued an “AI Strategy” outlining how it intends to use the technology to modernize the department, aid scientific research, and advance Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again campaign. One CDC staffer showed us a recent email sent to all agency employees encouraging them to start experimenting with tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. (We agreed to withhold the names of several HHS officials we spoke with for this story so they could talk freely without fear of professional repercussions.)

But the full extent to which the federal health agencies are going all in on AI is only now becoming clear. Late last month, HHS published an inventory of roughly 400 ways in which it is using the technology. At face value, the applications do not seem to amount to an “AI revolution.” The agency is turning to or developing chatbots to generate social-media posts, redact public-records requests, and write “justifications for personnel actions.” One usage of the technology that the agency points to is simply “AI in Slack,” a reference to the workplace-communication platform. A chatbot on RealFood.gov, the new government website that lays out Kennedy’s vision of the American diet, promises “real answers about real food” but just opens up xAI’s chatbot, Grok, in a new window. Many applications seem, frankly, mundane: managing electronic-health records, reviewing grants, summarizing swathes of scientific literature, pulling insights from messy data. There are multiple IT-support bots and AI search tools.

The number of back-office applications suggest the agency may be turning to AI in an attempt to compensate for the many thousands of HHS staff who have been fired or taken a voluntary buyout over the past year: For example, the database points to a “staffing shortage” as the reason why the agency’s Office of Civil Rights is piloting ChatGPT to identify patterns in court rulings involving Medicaid.

There are many ways this might go wrong. AI tools continue to make unpredictable errors; it’s very easy to imagine a tool intended to eliminate “fraud” accidentally cutting off someone’s Medicaid, or a tool intended to help ICU physicians recommending the wrong medication or dosage. In May, the agency released its landmark Make Our Children Healthy Again Report, which suggested that the government use AI to analyze trends in chronic-disease rates, including that of autism. The report was riddled with fake citations that appeared to be hallucinated by AI, which the White House attributed to formatting errors; HHS then corrected the report by removing the false citations and swapping in new references.

Several HHS employees told us that new AI tools in the department indeed make frequent errors and do not always fit into existing workflows. Despite the big claims that the administration has made about Elsa, the chatbot is “quite bad and fails at half the tasks you ask it for,” a FDA employee told us. In one instance, the staffer asked Elsa to look up the meaning of a three-digit product code in the FDA’s public database. The chatbot spit out the wrong answer. According to the same staffer, an internal website highlighting potential uses of Elsa includes relatively run-of-the-mill tasks such as creating data visualizations and summarizing emails, but because of hallucinations, “most people would rather just read the document themselves.” Another official said that he tried to use Elsa to evaluate a food-safety report. “It processed for a moment and then said ‘yeah, all good,’ when I knew it wasn’t,” the employee told us.

Some staffers we spoke with did have a more positive take. One CDC official said that his team is “constantly reporting on efficiencies that they are gaining using AI,” even if those use cases are routine, like summarizing documents. Many of the tools HHS is using seem well intentioned. A tool used by federal and local health departments, for example, allows officials to analyze grocery-store receipts gathered from people suffering from suspected foodborne illnesses around the country to search for commonalities in the foods they ate. In an email, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, told us that “a small number of disgruntled employees” have had problems with the agency’s AI tools. Many staffers, he said, “report that it improves their efficiency in carrying out their work.” Nixon added that even with staff shortages, the agency is “fully equipped to fulfill its duties.”

If anything, Kennedy is following the kinds of automations that are already being applied across health care. Medicine has become one of the biggest sources of hype for AI, with many ongoing attempts to both streamline the convoluted world of health care and produce life-saving research. Just as one example: Doctors can spend more than a third of their days writing notes, reviewing charts, and working through insurance claims in electronic-health-records systems. If AI products can automate just a bit of that work, health-care workers—which the U.S. has a chronic shortage of—will have more time to spend with patients. HHS is piloting AI tools that can streamline health records, as are many hospital networks around the country. Start-ups are working on building all sorts of AI health tools; both OpenAI and Anthropic recently launched health-care products.

The greatest promises of AI for health care are much flashier: curing cancer, discovering novel vaccines, treating previously incurable conditions. And there are, in the department’s approach to AI, some signs of an emerging technological paradigm shift. The HHS AI inventory reports a number of more ambitious projects, including using the technology to more quickly identify drug-safety concerns and study the genome of malaria parasites. These are AI tools that could genuinely change the kind of work doctors, epidemiologists, and medical researchers can do. AlphaFold—a protein-folding algorithm whose creators at Google DeepMind recently won a Nobel prize—is now used by researchers worldwide to advance drug discovery, including those at HHS.

Read: A virtual cell is a ‘holy grail’ of science. It’s getting closer.

Still, generative AI is not going to instantly supercharge the inner workings of HHS. (Even something as proven as AlphaFold only accelerates one slice of a very long drug-discovery process.) This is probably a good thing—the technology has come a long way, but also isn’t ready to totally remake one of the most influential public-health bodies in the world. If HHS continues to stick with an incremental approach to AI adoption, it could yield substantial improvements that are simply invisible to most.

But RFK Jr. may not be interested in stopping there. Many use cases are still being deployed or piloted, and the agency’s AI database is filled with jargon and platitudes that, in many instances, can be interpreted in multiple ways. When the administration says AI is or could be used for “Reviewing Global Influenza Vaccine Literature” or analyzing data in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the end results could be innocuous—or not. When Kennedy talks about using AI to eliminate fraud, he might mean using the technology to fire another 10,000 employees crucial to the nation’s public-health infrastructure. The inventory outlines means rather than motivations. In at least one listed use case, though, the design is openly political: HHS is deploying AI to identify positions in violation of President Trump’s executive orders on “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs” and “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism.”

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that at least until 2012, the Vatican was home to an ATM operating in Latin? Connected to the papal bank, the machine offered options like deductio ex pecunia—“cash withdrawal.”

The ATM hasn’t been reported on since—the pope’s bank is not exactly famous for its openness. But maybe an American Express Black cardholder might have luck. After all, it’s got a centurion on it.

How did you do? Come back next week for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that Britain used to pay its poets laureate mostly in wine? Beginning in 1630, the perk for taking on the job of voice of a nation was a small stipend and a “butt of sherry” from the monarch. In case you are not familiar with butts, they hold around 500 liters of wine, which I imagine really got the poetry flowing.

The 1790 laureate gave up his sherry—boo!—for a higher salary, ending the practice. But in 1984, the laureate Ted Hughes rekindled the tradition, and sherry has been delivered to every officeholder since. Alas, it’s now typically spread out over the laureate’s 10-year term; 72 bottles a year is nothing to sneeze at, but there’s nothing like a butt.

And by the way, did you know that the Andersonville prison popularized the word deadline? Before it came to mean “due date,” the word had a gory, literal meaning: Prisoners at Andersonville and camps like it who crossed a certain boundary marked on the ground—the deadline—would be shot without warning. As dispatches emerged from Andersonville toward the end of the Civil War, understanding of (and horror at) the term quickly spread.

By the 1920s, newspapers had taken up the “do not cross” meaning to describe the time by which they had to finalize their next edition, and the rest of the world took the papers’ lead.

And by the way, did you know that—well, where to begin with Ashgabat? The massive statue of Niyazov is, like, the ninth thing you notice about the city.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

Hoping to get around the ghostly city? Enjoy your ride in a white car; darkly colored cars are outlawed. You can head to the airport modeled on a flying white falcon, or to the world’s largest enclosed Ferris wheel, made of white steel. There is also the massive (white) Palace of Happiness, which can accommodate seven weddings at once. And in case you were wondering, brides in the country typically wear—got you here!—red.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.</div>

Americans don’t always know where their tax dollars are going, nor do they always agree with how they’re used. President Trump has an unorthodox proposal for where 10 billion of them should go: directly to him.

On January 29, Trump, along with the Trump Organization and his sons Don Jr. and Eric, sued the IRS for mishandling his tax information. The group is claiming improper disclosure—that a contractor leaked the president’s and his sons’ tax returns to The New York Times and ProPublica during Trump’s first term. (As part of his 2023 guilty plea for disclosing tax-return information without authorization, the contractor admitted to leaking Trump’s information to the Times.) The president is seeking $10 billion in damages; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed last week that all of it would come from the Treasury General Account, which consists entirely of taxpayer dollars.

The suit taps into a real issue: Taxation doesn’t work without privacy. In order to fully comply with the system, Americans need to be able to trust that their personal details won’t be made public. Anyone can pursue legal action after getting their data leaked; the tax code specifically allows for it. But Trump, who is suing the IRS in a personal capacity, also happens to be the president, which means that his job involves overseeing the agency and its parent, the Treasury Department. This circulation of taxpayer dollars to the president’s personal bank accounts by way of litigation would be the first such transfer in U.S. history, experts told me. (Trump also made history when he refused to release his returns despite having previously pledged to do so, thereby breaking the modern tradition of presidents voluntarily showing the American people their tax information.)

The lawsuit itself raises a few big questions. An amicus brief, co-filed by two watchdog organizations and four former government officials, argues that the case could be thrown out because Trump actually missed the date by which he was supposed to file. And the fact that the leaker was a contractor of the IRS at the time of the leaks, not an employee, could potentially get the case tossed on its own.

Then there’s the question of the $10 billion—an obscene amount on its face, but not entirely without logic. The tax code allows plaintiffs to sue for $1,000 per each instance of disclosure, or for an unspecified amount of “actual damages.” Trump’s lawyers are arguing that because his information was “likely seen by tens of millions of viewers”—in what’s known as secondary disclosure—and was covered widely in the press, Trump is entitled to “at least” $10 billion in statutory damages. Several courts have already rejected the idea that secondary disclosures count under this particular statute. If the courts opt for actual damages, Trump’s lawyers are also arguing that he has suffered at least $10 billion in financial harm. The president has said that if he wins, he will give all of the money to charity (although he hasn’t always been faithful to his promises to donate funds).

The suit is just the latest of Trump’s legal attacks on both private institutions and his own government. Since his election in 2024, the president has secured $16 million each from settlements with the media companies Paramount and ABC, and almost $60 million total from settlements with the American tech firms Meta, Alphabet, and X. Trump also filed complaints in 2023 and 2024 against another federal agency, the Department of Justice, and has reportedly demanded $230 million in compensation for its past investigations into him—but he did not officially sue. My colleague Quinta Jurecic called it a form of extortion.

Theoretically, an impartial court will adjudicate Trump’s IRS case. But the president ultimately controls both parties to the lawsuit. A judge would have to approve a settlement, but Bessent, who works a second job as acting commissioner of the IRS and who reports directly to the president, would oversee the payout. Keith E. Whittington, a professor at Yale Law School, told me that, under the broad theory of executive power that Trump has embraced in the past, he could potentially give direct instructions to either Bessent or the lawyers themselves. Courts may get “pretty nervous about a situation in which, arguably, you’ve got the same person on both sides of the case,” Whittington said. Trump himself has noted the potential conflict of interest: “I’m supposed to work out a settlement with myself,” he recently told reporters.

Trump’s destruction of presidential norms has been well documented at this point in his second term. But the IRS lawsuit represents something slightly different. Until now, there was no expectation that a president might “put the government in this situation, in which he is trying to extract money from the Treasury to serve his own private interest while he’s a sitting president,” Whittington explained. “One might characterize that as a question of norms, but I doubt it even occurred to anyone to think about whether or not this is an appropriate thing to do.”

What does it say about how Trump understands his role if he is willing to sue his own government to line his pockets? The job is meant to come with trade-offs: In exchange for power over the federal government, a president usually surrenders some ability to prioritize their personal interests—by divesting their holdings from private companies, for example (Trump has not done this, either). With the IRS lawsuit, Trump has discovered yet another way to leverage his office for his own gain. The question of whether he can sue his own agency is perhaps less important than whether he should.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Rod Dreher Thinks the Enlightenment Was a Mistake

On an April evening last year, Rod Dreher sat in the front row of an auditorium at the Heritage Foundation, in Washington, D.C., giddy with pride and happiness. He was there for the screening of a new documentary series based on one of his books, Live Not by Lies, about Christian dissidents from the former Soviet bloc—but first, a special guest was making his way toward the stage. J. D. Vance arrived at the podium to a roar of applause and told the crowd that he would not be the vice president of the United States if not for his friend Rod …

Unlike many in the crowd, Dreher, then 58, was not a staunch Donald Trump supporter; he had long criticized the president and came around only at the beginning of his second term, after concluding that Trump’s crude energy was needed to defeat progressive ideas. But Dreher has been giving voice to the yearnings and frustrations of religious conservatives for many years—as a magazine blogger with more than 1 million pageviews a month, an author of best-selling books, and a deliriously verbose writer on Substack. In January he joined The Free Press as a regular contributor. More than anyone else I know of, Dreher offers a full-fledged portrait of the cultural despair that haunts our era, a despair that has helped pave a road toward tyranny.

Think about love. Many daters have a list of traits they’re looking for in a partner—but they can be perfectly happy with someone who has few of them, Olga Khazan writes.

Read. Brooke Nevils’s memoir is also a reckoning with many misconceptions about #MeToo narratives, Hillary Kelly writes.

Seriously. Can&#39;t wait for all the high end shit to flood ebay and become cheap.

I don&#39;t see why a device that simply shuffles data between the internet and your house needs more than 100 MB. Let&#39;s be charitable and say 1GB (which was an absurd amount needed only to power high-end servers and workstations just a couple of decades ago). Looking on Digikey, you can still get the cheapest 1GB chip for $3, retail. This is worth about two days of a $50/month internet connection fee.

Luckily, I have an old ISP box that they doled out before all their equipment had to be a router, and I doubt t

I would imagine the modding down was the Old Fart Get Off My Lawn intro rather than anything to do with whether there was a torrent link or how big the archive was.

True, but the volume today is orders of magnitude more.  But also music has gotten more and more simplistic in recent years, relying on hooks to grab listeners. Rick Beato expresses it much better than I.

> True, but the volume today is orders of magnitude more

You know, I distinctly remember a music journalist on TV making the same argument about how music was simplistic and reliant on catchiness and so on. He even gave an example, holding up cards of the same repeated lyrics as he played a popular song.

The song was &quot;No Limits&quot; by 2 Unlimited and the year was probably 1993 or 1994. The 1990s was especially poor for music, and yet gave us the Nine Inch Nails among other great bands.

Nah, you just didn&#39;t make the point you thought you were making. What you said was:

&quot;Considering what passes for popular music these days, I&#39;d wear out my damn skip button&quot;

&quot;these days&quot; made it look like a get-off-my-lawn rant, rather than something about 90% of music of all eras being crap.

Does not appear to return any music in search results.

It still does. It means you stepped on someone&#39;s sensitive ego. Maybe Taylor Swift or Dua Lipa reads Slashdot?

It&#39;s 2035, and as you&#39;re walking down the street, a stranger furtively motions towards you from a doorway.  &quot;Hey buddy&quot;, he says.  &quot;I got here a 10TB thumb drive filled with humanity&#39;s 2 million most popular songs.  It&#39;s yours for $50.  Buy this and you can listen to music 24/7 for the next 22 years without ever repeating a song&quot;.

In a moment of weakness, you agree to the purchase, and it turns out the stranger was true to his word -- all the promised music is on the drive, pirated and mp3-compressed for you

Turn on the radio. When you hear something you like, check the catalog. Or listen to some podcasts that feature up and comers, or niche music. I can&#39;t begin to list all of the music I stumbled across listening to &quot;Bands Under the Radar&quot; by Kami Knake back in the day. Or classics I somehow missed on &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot; by Randy Bachman. But if you have &quot;all&quot; of Spotify, branch out. Tune into the local university AM/FM broadcast. Check out jazz stations. Come back to your library for the rest of it.

As long as you have it, someone&#39;ll figure a way that you like and write a script that you can use.

Any algorithm you can think of will run fine on any single CPU on any one of the several small computers you routinely carry around.

In 20 years your average American won&#39;t even be able to afford an American car, so I guess this hardly matters.

You should look under that hood.  You might be surprised as to the why.

In 20 years?  The big three US automakers have been focused on the luxury market for years, ceding much of the affordable compact car market to the likes of Kia and Toyota (foreign-owned, some domestic production).  GM, Ford, and whatever you call Chrysler hardly make any cars anymore. They mostly make trucks and luxury SUVs. And they have been very successful at it and make tons of money.  But the side effect is that few average Americans can really afford their products right now.

This.  When GM brought back the Bolt after a massive outcry, only the compact crossover was resurrected, not the smaller sub-compact hatchback.  So if you want a tiny electric city car for commuting, you&#39;re out of luck.

Meanwhile, every major Chinese automaker has compact and sub-compact BEVs (and often PHEVs) that are affordable.  So I can only imagine how quickly US brands are going to cede the Canadian, Caribbean, and Latin American markets to the Chinese and Koreans.

When GM brought back the Bolt after a massive outcry, only the compact crossover was resurrected, not the smaller sub-compact hatchback.  So if you want a tiny electric city car for commuting, you&#39;re out of luck.My partner has a Bolt EUV, I have a Bolt EV.  The differences between the vehicle designs is almost entirely down to aesthetics.  Yeah, the EUV is a few mm larger in places, but it&#39;s imperceivable when you&#39;re driving it, and makes absolutely no difference when it comes to practical cargo capacity*.  Basically, the EUV looks &quot;sportier&quot;, which is neither here nor there when you&#39;re comparing compact hatchbacks.* One time, I actually brought home a heat pump clothes dryer from Best Buy in the back of my Bolt.

The US automakers focus on profits, just like every other western car company does.  They do not have the massive subsidies and forced directing of the Chinese government.  Also no Uighur slave labor to keep costs down.

More to the point, Americans want the luxury features and pay for them.  Generally, the car companies were giving people what they want while trying to meet various competing foreign and domestic demands, including environmental.

China has cornered the market on Lithium for batteries the same way they&#39;ve done with rare earths. That&#39;s why their electric cars are cheaper.If you could make the car battery with no lithium carbonate at all, but everything else the same, it would still be about 85% to 90% of the same price and the battery is about a third of the price of the car. So, even if the lithium is were free, which it is not, that should only mean about a 3% to 5% reduction in the price of the car.

Speak for yourself. For me, a car has always been a means to get from point A to point B, never something I would want luxury, especially since it&#39;s a highly depreciating asset. I certainly like luxury and pay for it in my house and musical instruments. Never cars. That is by choice.

The reason we have owned GM cars in the last 10 years (2015 Volt, 2017 Bolt, and now 2025 Equinox EV replacing the Volt) is that they best fit our needs at the right price point. The Equinox EV is too big, though. I would have m

It doesn&#39;t exist because, for the most part, it costs as much to produce that EUV as the smaller Bolt, and few were willing to pay about the same for the smaller car.

I never mentioned the Bolt EUV. It is similar in size to the Bolt EV, and would have been a much better fit than the Equinox EV.

Bolt EUV was not available in 2025. Even the 2026 EUV model is underwhelming in terms of range. Chevy could very much have designed a small car >300 miles of range. They chose not to. In 11 months, our 2017 Bolt EV will be 10 years old. That&#39;s the time when we&#39;ll think about replacing it. It won&#39;t be another Bolt (EV or EUV) since GM botched the range on the new model, and alrea

Cars are not the highly depreciating asset that they used to be, far from it.

I believe part of the problem is that every bit three car has to cover thousands of dollars of pension payments to retired Boomers. So it makes no sense to try to sell cheap cars.

I don&#39;t really see how high-cost Western manufacturers with big pension costs can compete with Chinese manufacturers paying peanuts.

In 20 years your average American won&#39;t even be able to afford an American car, so I guess this hardly matters.We&#39;re already there, if you&#39;re talking about a purchase of the average priced vehicle with the average median income.  The average American is buying someone else&#39;s sloppy seconds through the likes of Carvana and CarMax, and the really lower income folks?  They&#39;re buying beaters.The poor?  Maybe an e-scooter or e-bike, if they&#39;re lucky.

There haven&#39;t been any fully american cars for a long time.Today it&#39;s just a badge slapped on a vehicle assembled from foreign parts.

Wow, this writedown is the perfect time to buy stock in your favorite automaker.

BRB, it&#39;s time for me to buy some F (Ford) stock.

It had better be for short-term speculation, you&#39;re buying stock in a company which even though they were headquartered in Michigan still took 80 years to figure out how to build a car that didn&#39;t rust out in three winters.  They still can&#39;t build a truck that doesn&#39;t get stuck in 6 inches of snow unless it has 4-wheel drive and some serious weight in the back.

Pickup trucks are pickup trucks.  And frankly, Ford has one of the best.I have to admit, they do look quite lovely on the side of the road waiting for a tow.

I hear you can fit 6 whole grocery bags in the bed!

I have a 2002 Tacoma with the smallest 4-banger they sold and a manual 5-speed, and it&#39;s every bit as much truck as I need and in reality at least 75% of other truck owners need.  I can, and do, carry a yard of manure or 1300 pounds of landscaping blocks and it&#39;s perfectly adequate.  It drives a hundred times better than an F-150 and has better handling in the snow than any American car or truck that I&#39;ve ever driven.

As a three time Tesla owner, I can state their cars were not low quality. In virtually every possible way they were better than any Big 3 car I ever drove. Owned a 2016 S that I traded in for a 2022 S. Wife had a 2018 3. Both traded in last April.

We ditched our Teslas last year for Ioniq 5&#39;s, but that decision had nothing to do with the car quality. I just couldn&#39;t keep dealing with the Musk that hovered in the air being a Tesla owner anymore.

Will Hyundai ever fix the stupidity where you cannot precondition the battery for fast charging without being forced to use the in-dash navigation system?  Seems so dumb. It&#39;s just a software switch they need to expose.

In general this insistence on putting wheels on a computer really turns me off of EVs, though I really want one.  EV makers seem to think that drivers are too stupid to drive without the navigation system on telling them how to drive to their local grocery store (which happens to have a fast

TBH as a owner of EVs since 2012 and an all in owner (no gas left) since 2018, I can say I have no idea. Because I have used L2 chargers for almost everything and think I used super chargers maybe 3 times ever. I haven&#39;t used them in the year since I traded in the Tesla&#39;s for Ioniq&#39;s.

While I have no doubt fast charging can matter. I think the actual need for it is overestimated by non-EV folks.

We have 3 Teslas in our family. They are good cars. But, we bought them before Musk went insane. We are not likely to ever buy another Tesla. We are not in need of another vehicle anytime soon. Hopefully by the time we do, some other viable options will become available.

If the country ever started allowing the Chinese EVs in, that might just doom the doom the ICE makers for good.

Who pointed out fraud? Can you point us to some real examples of fraud, something that has not only been &quot;pointed out&quot;, but also investigated, proven to be such in a court and lead to real sentences?

Or perhaps you can show us how pointing out this fraud has lead to some verifiable manifestation of its existence, e.g. a massive reduction of the government debt or something?

The very effective people who  claimed  fraud must have something to show for all that talk, no?

As a three time Tesla owner, I can state their cars were not low quality.Maybe the AC was referring to the body panel fitment issues which seemed to be a thing for awhile.  *shrug*Personally, I just never could get past that everything about the car felt like it was unapologetically designed by a software company.

Korea, Japan and China have been eating US auto&#39;s lunch for decades with no sign of change on the horizon.  US cars are junk and always have been from a manufacturing quality standpoint.  Good luck getting one past 100k without major issue and 200k is just a unicorn where stars aligned for one particular vehicle in a run of 1000s.

My uncle worked at the Chrysler Proving Grounds where he got to do the fun things like drive cars into brick walls and T-bone them with steel rails.  In the late &#39;70s they sent most of his team out to wreaking yards around the country.  There they looked for vehicles with more than 70,000 miles and tore them apart, their task was to look for parts that were not wearing as fast as others.  For example if the swing arms were still in good shape the company would lean on the manufacturer to lower the quality so that they would also fail before 100,000 miles, that way high-mileage vehicles would rapidly become too expensive to maintain and owners would be forced to buy a new vehicle.  He said that he met testers from the other big car companies in some of the junkyards doing the same thing.

I suspect management had been &quot;inspired&quot; by the poem &quot;The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay&quot;.

Tesla&#39;s sales are down, too.  Last I checked, unlike the Detroit automakers, they don&#39;t have highly profitable ICE product lines to fall back on.  Sure, for now we&#39;ve kept BYD out, which gives Tesla a slight advantage in the EV realm that their CEO has helped sabotage, but administrations change.

Eh, even the Ford GT doesn&#39;t have a V8 anymore.

Those who wanted to get an EV, have already got one. The others are not martyrs and are not going to make their life more difficult for a higher cause.

The tax credit ending didn&#39;t help matters.  Plus, somewhere around 34% of Americans are renters and that makes owning an EV a massive pain in the ass if you can&#39;t charge it at home.

We probably are nearing saturation point where everyone who wanted an EV, has a place to charge it, and could afford it, already has one.  Adjusted for inflation, gas is still kind of cheap throughout much of the US and utility rates are rising due to AI data center demand, so the cost savings of going EV aren&#39;t as significant as

15 years on and not a single hatchback. I wish I could get one. I have solar and a garage. My gas would be basically free.

Those who wanted to get an EV, have already got one.

I want one, and I haven&#39;t gotten one yet.  (don&#39;t buy cars very often)

In fact, I struggle to think of any politically-dictated from on high business decision that didn&#39;t end up with some poor sap taking a bath.

That&#39;s a matter of perspective.  The ban on whaling was disastrous if you happened to be a whaler, but the petroleum industry made bank.

An &quot;EV mandate&quot; the likes of what the right-wing constantly fearmongered over would&#39;ve been a huge boon to Tesla, and any other automakers who managed to get their EV act together.  After the dust settles, there&#39;d be winners and there&#39;d be losers - but that&#39;s just business.  How many Blockbuster Video stores you see around these days?

Instead of taking this opportunity to learn from their own failures. These companies are relying on a tenuous political landscape that keeps them under protection from competition.

Wouldn&#39;t be investing in any of these soon-to-fail corporations.

Well, the Ford guy toured the Chinese companies, got scared, and decided that it&#39;s a good time to squeeze the automakers for the last dregs of profits. Before they go down for good.

Meanwhile, Africa and Asia are getting flooded by Chinese EVs. That are now superior to gas cars on price and reliability. And that can be charged from local solar, not depending on imported gas. The cheapest Chinese EVs are now less than $10k, and you can get a very reasonable EV for $15k.

after years of aggressive investment into a transition that, even before Republican lawmakers abolished a $7,500 federal tax credit last fall, was already running below expectations. U.S. EV sales fell more than 30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 once the credit expired in September, and Congress also eliminated federal fuel-efficiency mandates.sounds like the big 3&#39;s balance sheet sheet was in the negative before the expiration (August, September?) but shit really hit the fan after September? is that a fair take?

Either we have a fast charger for every gas nozzle in the country so we don&#39;t have to plan gas stops (because some folks are following courses set by others without regard to charging), or the cars themselves have to have insanely long ranges like 750 - 900 miles so&#39;s we can make do with the rare density of fast chargers.

I say fast chargers because nothing else is any good when you&#39;re trying to cover 100&#39;s of miles in a day.   You can&#39;t sit around for an hour every 200 - 250 miles and have an equivalent-to-

I guess we can conclude that Zuck has gone tits up and now we just get his Dead Bot.

This is less about him being autistic and more about him being a sociopath.

Exactly, after your death you keep posting and oh look, you suddenly will endorse product X....

Salivating at selling ghosts to do testimonials for you...

Uhh... If my dead sister liked a post I don&#39;t think I would feel very good at all. Like never visit the site again level of revulsion.

Yeah this is fucked up. If some bot starts posting as one of my dead friends (you start accumulating them as you get older, alas) honestly, I&#39;m gonna lose my shit.

Resrurect me as a bot, and I swear I&#39;ll come back as a ghost and start haunting shitty tech bros.

Good thing I don&#39;t have any social media accounts that need to keep going.

What would the world do without my comments?

How will my AI feel when I tell it that it is going to die with me?

Based on previous experiments it&#39;ll try blackmailing you for more content.

But, you&#39;re dead. It has to try and bring you back long enough to get the content to serve its purpose. ...and that&#39;s how we get the zombie apocalypse.

What would the world do without my comments?This tech is useful for appeal to emotions or appeal to authority fallacies, and marketing. Got a cause, got a product, that could use a bump ... pay Meta to have the appropriate &quot;person&quot; like it, comments on it, etc.

After all, pervasive and unavoidable advertising and endorsements seem to have been the ultimate goal of modern civilisation.The interesting aspect will be the court cases and lawsuits around compensating the estates and families of deceased stars.

So fb will turn my account into zombie account. I hope my zombie avatar will not like or follow zucks posts or account.

Here&#39;s another idea for fb to present to their investors. For a small fee I can pay while alive, my zombie account  would get the option to post some cute AI slop.

So fb will turn my account into zombie account.And you can bet they wont tell their investors how many &quot;active users&quot; are really still living people. Perhaps a acknowledgement that their user base is trending older and will begin dying off (or at least reach a point where they stop using a computer) in the near future.

It also seems to me that there is prior art.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve gotten feedback from spammers pretending to be someone who was actually dead.

Tons of prior art. I am pretty sure I&#39;ve seen it on Black Mirror, but it&#39;s been suggested long before then. A quick search finds Hans Moravec writing about it in 1988. Since the restrictions on patents for prior art or for them being non-obvious to one skilled in the art have been watered down to the point of meaninglessness, that doesn&#39;t stop patent examiners from just rubber stamping garbage like this.

Not surprising, but patents (in the US) really need to be a use it or lose it thing.  They&#39;re not intended to prohibit inventions, but protect them temporarily from competition.  You should lose them if you dont have a product in customer hands within a year of it being granted and if you stop making it available, the patent becomes forfeit.  But i guess this is just one thing in a long list of patent reforms needed.   Also, this is a stupid patent, but nevertheless, a gross misuse of patents.

&quot;Not surprising, but patents (in the US) really need to be a use it or lose it thing.&quot;

Why?  The alleged benefit of a patent is a reward for teaching the industry your invention, why should you be required to conduct a business to be rewarded for the effort and expense you have already sacrificed?

I don&#39;t know the solution, but your take is just naive.

Naive or not it&#39;s a fucked up cash grab when this type of stuff is obvious and has plenty of prior art. Shit I&#39;ve personally thought about doing something like for fun before 2023. Shit maybe that should be a byline in a trust I&#39;ll found. Run an AI bot for me indefinitely. What are they gonna do about it?

A trillion dollars... for whatever the fuck this is.

And what happens when you die but a week later they come out with a new frontier model, and then a week later the model you were written for has been shutdown because nobody is using it any more because it just wasn&#39;t as good as the DEAITH-39oB model and it also kept praising hitler for some reason.

The market is anyone who can&#39;t let go. Imagine that your child dies in an accident, and someone tells you that you can keep talking to your child if you just pay up a hundred bucks a month. In the middle of your grief - could you easily say no?

How the UK arrests AI for peoples twitter posts after theyâ(TM)re dead.

Dead celebrities often have active social media accounts run by the staff of their estate, usually with the purpose of marketing their products. I can imagine how this sort of use of AI would add a little colour to the postings of these AI ghosts.

Hey, they could add a new status (like married/single) to indicate dead/alive.

Hey, they could add a new status (like married/single) to indicate dead/alive.Don&#39;t we already have enough special status info to keep track of now that &quot;preferred pronouns&quot; are a thing?I&#39;m reminded of a meme from four decades ago - &quot;Nuke the gay baby whales for Jesus in Cambodia&quot;.

I do not wish people I know now to waste what precious life they have on artificial commentary from an account I once owned (not logged in for decade or more now).

I behaved differently in that account anyway due to the audience. That&#39;d not represent me now anyhow.

Please, nobody should was energy on either side of this.

As Meta&#39;s user base &quot;ages out&quot;, this seems more like a tactic to keep the &quot;active user count&quot; up.   Don&#39;t let my death stop you from counting me as part of your subscriber numbers to investors.

for the living, why not also extend this to dead people. And really, it keeps people on the platform, who wouldn&#39;t want their dead grandma to like their post?

If only AI chatbots are conversing and posting to one another, who&#39;s actually going to see the ads, mmm? And who will pay for ads that aren&#39;t seen by human beings?

Can&#39;t wait to see lawsuits from widows being friended by their dead husbands on FB.

Maybe I should start running my own pet robot Zuckerberg. He&#39;d totally not mind at all, right?

That just shows the patent system is utterly broken.

How would you know?  Have you seen the patent?  Or are you going on the nonexistent information in this &quot;article&quot;?

You cannot judge obviousness of something when you have no idea what is even claimed.  Don&#39;t let that stop you from your ignorant categorical statements, though.

A product for the only time I&#39;d be willing to use Facebook.

It says something about the age we live in that we&#39;re only mildly surprised to read a headline like

Meta&#39;s New Patent: an AI That Likes, Comments and Messages For You When You&#39;re Dead

It means that we immediately know what Meta, Patent, AI, social media (Likes, Comments and Messages) and dead mean.

Sweet, now I can have Flamebait comments posted *forever*.

A Meta spokesperson told Business Insider the company has &quot;no plans to move forward&quot; with the technology.Really?

The penalties for violating are pretty steep. But I have found a bug in the system that a

Like, do I really want my dead father posting?  How is that going to make me feel?  The people who thought this up are heartless bastards.I hope their parents all die and they have to watch their stupid-ass AI post shit.  What the fuck you fucking morons.

The fact that more than one person was likely involved in thinking this was a good idea, is quite disturbing.

So much for Kuhn&#39;s paradigm shift...now the dead advocate of an obsolete paradigm or methodology will continue on, but that&#39;s progress, moving forward one step backward, at a time. Perhaps &quot;paradigm entrenchment&quot; is the new, new thing?

... we&#39;re going to buy them from European companies

You don&#39;t understand. Not using Microsoft&#39;s cutting edge super advanced technology chat app or Google&#39;s, um, spreadsheet I guess, will clearly cripple any business, country or even a whole continent!

I&#39;m having trouble thinking of any of these irreplaceable software technologies, at least ones that aren&#39;t tiny niche things.

Indeed. Google is basically yesterday&#39;s hot tech. Well, the day before yesterday.

There&#39;s literally countless providers of products and services that you&#39;ve never heard of providing alternatives. The problem is American companies keep buying them. Heck Slashdot&#39;s favourite office suite (LibreOffice) is German, and open source to boot. It integrates with a self hosting cloud system that is also developed in Germany (ownCloud). The biggest competitor to Office 365 and whatever Google&#39;s online groupware is called is from Collabora (UK based). If you don&#39;t want to use NextCloud Talk as a Tea

ok, i applaud these alternatives, if anything because they&#39;re opensource rather than because they&#39;re european led, but just the same i&#39;m happy if the current international context now favors their growth and wider adoption. this is a good thing. however i don&#39;t think these sort of technologies are what this is about. i&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t talent and good ideas in europe, there are, but i doubt it is enough and above all we lack the political leadership to drive and faciltate any significant independenc

Just the fact that EU has no own major companies like Google, Microsoft or Amazon means that it is not competitive already.

How difficult is it to put up a website with an LLM?

And European companies already have their own search engines and cloud providers, they&#39;re just not as big as the Amazons of the world.

I don&#39;t think you realize the magnitude of the stupidity of Trump&#39;s shenanigans. Europe is just coming out of a millennium of savage, brutal wars. The EU started as a treaty organization for coal and steal. It was a peace project to intertwine European economies. We enjoyed an unprecedentedly high standard of living while the US could go off and be exceptional all they wanted. Everything that happened after WWII was a win-win, with the quiet understanding that the US wouldn&#39;t go and make a mess on our side of the Atlantic with all its exceptionalizing.

But now the US has exceptionalized all over our faces for purely internal political reasons and broken the status quo.

We are fucking livid. We could stand by and keep our cool until one single thing happened. You threatened our borders.

Welcome to the decline of the US as a world power, you motherfuckers.

There&#39;s still a little bit of exceptionalism in your hair. Sorry.

Sorry Lavandera, I replied to the wrong post.

Oh no, who will rent terrible software and sell counterfeit products without Google, Microsoft, and Amazon?

Just the fact that EU has no own major companies like Google, Microsoft or Amazon means that it is not competitive already.I think you really do not know how tech works. Large companies are only good for shoveling tons of money, not for making good tech.

The problem is they sold it. Google wants to talk about European competitiveness? Their share price is entirely propped up this past year by a company they bought in the UK - which formed the centre for all of Google&#39;s AI developments.

But I think you (or rather Google) begged the question. Why do you need one singular mega company to be competitive? How does having one big company compare to having 10 smaller ones? Amazon is a good example, the jack of all trades company. Well Europe has plenty of cloud pro

Doesn&#39;t have it yet. If EU authorities want to migrate to Linux and free software (current push) there is a lot of opportunity for EU companies to grow by providing that. And some of them may become competition for Google.

One of the challenges with the most EU countries is that trying to create a startup is lot harder. Just consider the extra bureaucracy and stricter labour laws. These often end up playing to the advantage of establish medium to large businesses, who don&#39;t have the innovative drive needed in many cases.

If there was some carve out for startups then we could see a more dynamic IT sector, but right now it may actually be better to incentivise Canada to work with the EU to find a solution that works. I say Canad

Don&#39;t want to lose business outside the U.S. ? The solution is simple: Stop supporting psycopathic child-rapists who threaten with military action the sovereignty of allied nations.

And to the republicans out there: Choose your presidential candidates better. The rest of the world don&#39;t give a fuck if your president is a democrat or a republican. They do care, however, if he&#39;s an authoritarian bully and wannabe dictator. Haven&#39;t you noticed yet that no previous U.S. president, democrat or republican, has ever caused such an international uproar before ? It&#39;s no longer a R vs D thing, it&#39;s a &quot;at least seemingly decent, competent human being taking his job seriously&quot; vs &quot;one of the most narcissic, sociopathic, childish, disgusting american public figure&quot; thing.

You missed &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;rapist&quot; in there, but yes, that is the problem. But the US economy is long-term fucked and hence the military might will go away as well a bit later. And then nobody will care about it anymore unless it finds out how to get somewhat decent leaders again. I am not hopeful on that front. Too many deranged fanatics.

Haven&#39;t you noticed yet that no previous U.S. president, democrat or republican, has ever caused such an international uproar before ?No. Europeans are always complaining. It&#39;s the French cafe thing.

Then everyone benefits, at lower overall costs (because there won&#39;t be the inevitable rent-seeking from greedy corporations, U.S. or otherwise).

Exactly. Linux comes from Finland and is GPL. Android runs Linux. Best technology in the world? Not a problem for Europe!

Even NON-FOSS is better. Skype was great (feature-wise) until Microsoft got to it, and eventually killed it with no equivalent (feature-wise).

Isolationism cuts off the ability to benefit from others advances, but what choice do you have but to become self sufficient when your greatest ally and largest trading partner becomes hostile?

The thing is, we&#39;re not trying to be self-sufficient. There&#39;s a whole world out there willing tohave healthy trade and strategic relations with Europe. We just struck deals with Australia, India and Mercosur. We&#39;re just cutting off the US since it&#39;s behaving like a hostile power, the rest of the world is welcome.

I&#39;ll say this as a developer working for years in the US for a EU-based company.

Ignoring GDPR, we spend a significant amount of time developing solutions that maintain compliance EU or country-specific laws (Germany and France are pretty notorious). We do charge for these compliance levels - it&#39;s not free. We do the same for other parts of the world too, from Argentina to Australia. But the EU is on a whole other level for regulation and other geopolitical restrictions.

In our specific field, many of our competitors just choose not to deal with it and I think that&#39;s what the OP is getting at. If you are a company in Germany shopping for software or SaaS solutions, the market is much smaller and more expensive than if you are in US, Canada, Brazil, or Singapore. That is a drag on your ability to build and sell whatever you are doing.

the market is much smaller and more expensive than if you are in US, Canada, Brazil, or SingaporeIs it really more expensive in the long-term, given the inevitably increasing rent-seeking by the greedy &quot;Big Established Tech&quot; corporations?

the market is much smaller and more expensive than if you are in US, Canada, Brazil, or Singapore

Is it really more expensive in the long-term, given the inevitably increasing rent-seeking by the greedy &quot;Big Established Tech&quot; corporations?

The regulations are there for a reason. The USA should implement them too.

Meh. Those regulations are nothing compared to trying to maintain compliance with various US government bureaucracies. DoD is a notorious example.

Gee, nothing self-serving there, is there?

When big tech complaints to me it looks we&#39;re on the good track.

Dear Google, we&#39;ve seen the alternative... corrupted politicians bribed by big tech in government contracts with millions of licenses for text editors and paying am arm and a leg for &quot;cloud storage&quot;.

It&#39;s their risk to take. Let them take it.

Just imagine how great American would be with an noncompetitive Europe.

Whether it&#39;s good or bad for Europe is yet to be seen. That it will be bad fro Google&#39;s sales is not in dispute. Suck it.

Is what they&#39;re really saying.  Because you better believe that if the EU develops better software platforms that people outside of the EU will want to use them.

Google is complaining they need to reduce their shady stuff.

After decades of allowing the USA to shaft our IT industry we finally start looking inward at what remains of our tech industry because uncle Sam becomes a greedy, selfish megalomaniac and now google acts all butt-hurt?

There are loads of companies in the EU providing what Google, Microsoft, and Amazon could provide.

But, alas, these companies are based in the USA and so can only be considered untrustworthy (because of the CLOUD act, for example).

SuSE gmbh (German) provides an entire operating system; both fo

China seems to be doing &quot;just fine&quot; without Google, and increasingly without Microsoft (Windows) too. I&#39;m sure Europe can manage too. Maybe it&#39;ll be painful to quit the habit, but ultimately it will be worthwhile.

Until they release a breaking bug on their morning commute, and some people on the bus suddenly lose their Spotify. Then said developer has no idea what went wrong, likely for hours or even days, while the AI keeps hallucinating fixes that don&#39;t work, as both it and the developers have no idea what they&#39;re actually doing.

It&#39;s fine, let Spotify show the world how it goes when you de-skill a team.

It&#39;s a mostly finished product now anyway, this is probably more telling that no new client of theirs has demanded something that their cookie cutter team didn&#39;t have a template for already.

Please don&#39;t work during your morning commute. Especially if you&#39;re the one driving.But almost as importantly, if your employer makes you come into the office then you should ONLY work while at the office. And they can go F themselves if they want you to work on your own time as well.

Maybe I&#39;m just naive* but - it&#39;s hard for me to imagine a competent developer willingly allowing new code to be &quot;pushed to Slack&quot; before they have a chance to run through the changes with their own eyes.

It&#39;s Spotify, it doesn&#39;t have to work correctly or even at all.  I&#39;ll worry when I hear about one of my financial institutions doing this.

I think we&#39;d completely agree if we were on the same job. IE: GUI thing - dev should look at it. New backend function - dev should write a test for it. New API function - dev should ensure docs are right and write a test for it. And I&#39;d go so far as to say that the newly written tests should be run and they should pass before the code gets handed off.

An example of what I was referring to...Let&#39;s say you have a dev add a &quot;nickname&quot; field to a person info page. But they copy/paste a dropdown instead of a text

However, I don&#39;t have a commute (WFH) and I don&#39;t really work even when I&#39;m &#39;working&#39;, so what I&#39;d appreciate would be some tips on gracefully reducing my productivity even further.

Driving? Like, a car? Why drive when you can pay two bucks for someone else to do it for you, and not worry about parking and car maintenance? What is this, the 20th century?

this story reminds me a company meeting where our new manager was introduced as having delivered his last two projects with zero bugs.

we all burst into laughter at the same timefollowed by an awkward silience.

Is it true that AI code can&#39;t be copyrighted?Pretty much the whole industry assumes that AI-written code is owned by the company who employs the engineer who was using the AI.  I don&#39;t think this has been litigated, but if it were to go the way you suggest it would create... problems.

In 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia became the first court to specifically address the copyrightability of AI-generated outputs. The plaintiff challenged the Office&#39;s refusal to register an image that was described in his application as &quot;autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine.&quot; Affirming the Office&#39;s refusal, the court stated that &quot;copyright law protects only works of human creation,&quot; and that &quot;human authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright.&quot; It found that &quot;copyright has never stretched so far [as] . . . to protect works generated by new forms of technology operating absentany guiding human hand.&quot; Because, by his own representation, the &quot;plaintiff played no role in using the AI to generate the work,&quot; the court held that it did not meet the human authorship requirement. The decision has been appealed.I have not seen any appeals ruling yet on this. But I also do not expect one as this follows many other such copyright rulings in the past, such as the cases like the &quot;monkey selfie&quot; case, which the Copyright office issued a Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices 12/22/2014 which stated:&quot;only works created by a human can be copyrighted under United States law, which excludes photographs and artwork created by animals or by machines without human intervention&quot; and that &quot;Because copyright law is limited to &#39;original intellectual conceptions of the author&#39;, the [copyright] office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work. The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.&quot;Then there is the case of the copyright of comic book &quot;Zarya of the Dawn&quot;, authors by artist and AI consultant, Kris Kashtanova, which the images were all created/generated through the use of Midjourney. They Copyright office provided a copyright only on the compendium of the book itself, but all the individual images generated via Midjourney are not copyrightable and are in the public domain to be free for use by anyone, as the simple operation of prompts and instructions to Midjourney was insufficient human authorship to be able to claim a human created the work.

Kinda, but you would need to separate the AI code from the rest. You would also need to get your hands on it legally. So if someone else leaks it (and breaks a contract and leaks trade secret) you are allowed to copy it (you didn&#39;t have a contract), if you know its pure AI. You also need to prepared to win a lawsuit against a company that has the money to fight a long legal battle while you probably do not even have the time to go through with it. So you may have a chance to troll them, but it would be very

the way things are going it&#39;ll be a lot sooner than 20 years

Just another CEO spouting BS in order to promote his product and pump the share price. Any knowledge he has of the dev process has probably gone through 3 or 4 layers of management chinese whispers first.

I also wonder if their new definition of &quot;best developers&quot; is &quot;developers who rely entirely on LLMs for coding.&quot;

With that semantic shift in place, they can hire new cheap greenies who rely entirely on LLMs because they can&#39;t code, and who do nothing but cause trouble for the actual competent developers who are manually fixing everything they break, and spin it to sound like progress.

The experiences reported in these articles are so utterly unlike the ones I have using AI to generate code.  It HAS gotten better in the last year, but it is still no where near this capable, for me.

If I give it too many requirements at once, it completely fails and often damages the code files significantly, and I have to refresh from backup.If I give it smaller prompts in a series, doing some testing myself between prompts, there is usually something I need to fix manually.  And if I don&#39;t, and just let it successfully build on what it built before, the code becomes increasingly more impenetrable.  The variable names and function names are &quot;true&quot; but not descriptive (too vague, usually) and when those mount up the code becomes unreadable.  It generates code comments but they are utterly worthless noise that point out the outright obvious without telling you anything actually useful.  When new requirements negate or alter prior ones, the AI does not refactor them into a clean solution but just duplicates code and leaves the old no-longer-needed code behind and makes variable names even more weird to make up for it.  The performance of the code decays quickly.  And on top of all this, it STILL can&#39;t succeed at all if you need to do anything that is a little too unique to your business needs.  Like a fancy complex loose sort with special rules or whatever.  It tries and fails, but tells you it succeeds, and you get code that doesn&#39;t work.

Sometimes it can solve surprisingly hard problems, and then get utterly stuck on something trivial.  You tell it what is wrong and it shuffles a lot of code around and says &quot;there, fixed&quot; and it is still doing exactly what it did wrong before.

I have good success getting new projects started using AI code generation.  When it is just generating mostly scaffolding and foundational feature support code that tends to be pretty generic, it saves me time.  But once the aspects of the code that are truly unique to the needs start coming into focus, AI fails.

I still do most of my coding by hand because of this.  I use AI when I can but once this stuttering starts happing I drop it like a hot potato because it causes nothing but problems from then on.

I simply don&#39;t see how the same solution could reliably make consistent and significant changes to a codebase and produce reliable, performant, or even functional code on an ongoing basis.  That hasn&#39;t ever worked for me and still doesn&#39;t, even with the latest gen AI models.

The frustrating part is that it&#39;ll often start out creating almost exactly what I want but as you modify or give it corrections, instead of fixing the image, it just progressively wrecks it bit by bit.

I&#39;m pretty sure if you used Spotify level money to have your own AI cluster trained on your own code, it would have been a much different experience.

The rest of us won&#39;t get similar results.

>> If I give it too many requirements at once, it completely fails

Same experience here, but the trick is knowing what &#39;too many requirements&#39; consists of. The modern agents (see Google&#39;s Antigravity for an example) make a plan beforehand that you review and approve. You can make adjustments and tell it to break the implementation out into incremental phases so things don&#39;t go awry.

Very consistent with my experience.  Sure, it can accelerate certain tasks, but it will blunder along the way.

Even if it gets something mostly right but I see a mistake, it sounds like they say explain the mistake to it to let it try to fix it (which for me when I tried was very unreliable, and more work than just manually amending the code, since I also know that correcting it&#39;s mistake won&#39;t even pay dividends because it won&#39;t &#39;learn&#39; from that interaction).  I have similar experiences with people, it&#39;s s

These kinds of AI fluff pieces are all about trying to assuage their investors&#39; fears. Don&#39;t worry, it seems to say: we&#39;re at the cutting edge, and no we won&#39;t be replaced by a vibe-coded app anytime soon. It could be true, it could be all made up, but it doesn&#39;t matter as long as their shareholders feel good.

Yeah, they speak to stupid shareholders, and shareholders that might not be stupid, but are willing to bank on the stupidity of others, either way, currently money wise the money flows to the hype.

But very good point that this *should* be a double edged sword.  Our software can be completely constructed low skilled using LLM, so what might prevent competition from just eating their lunch on the technical front?  Of course, it is just spotify, and it&#39;s not exactly a technical marvel to begin with, basically

The only question here is: What are they selling? Increased stock value?From what I have observed in recent years, C-level people believe that their company will profit greatly from using LLM-based services that they pay other companies for. And when their stock value drops, they find out too late that any potential upside of their use of such services would also apply to any competitor, to the point where mundane SaaS-services can be vibe-coded by anyone, accepting the same lower quality standards they introduced by using LLM-generated code.

Well, for a company like Spotify, the downside isn&#39;t so scary because their software isn&#39;t exactly doing rocket science either.  Their business is internet radio with on-demand capability.  The technical piece is relatively basic enablement of that direction that isn&#39;t difficult and others can and have easily competed on technical design.  See the cited three features, *super* easy sounding stuff.

But I *have* seen a software sales guy fail to understand the point you just made. He was excited because now wh

Or Spotify has simply laid off their best developers and replaced them with AI.

Or Spotify has gone to crap and no one gives a damn because Spotify blames all their problems on Apple Music Monopoly.

Or Spotify is trying to cash in on AI hype money while they still can.

Or Spotify&#39;s developers were on vacation since December. They&#39;re in Europe, so they get like 2 months of vacation, right?

Or Spotify just hasn&#39;t done anything that requires code changes in 2 months. The backend systems are mature and the APIs wor

Autocompletes are counted as it writing it!It completes 1 letter of the word, it gets counted as typing that word for you.

Think how high your stats would be on your phone for how much the phone&#39;s autocomplete and word suggestion &quot;wrote for you.&quot;

If you use AI coding and everything you type gets replaced search suggestions and your corrections are also completed then it can be 100% even if you actually wrote most of it; it&#39;s how you count it and they are counting this stuff at extremes.

No way experienced developers are letting AI generate bug fixes or entirely new features using Slack to talk to AI on the way to work.Depends on whether they can review the code and tests effectively first.  I frequently push commits without ever typing a line of code myself: Tell the LLM to write the test, and how to write it, check the test, tell the LLM how to tweak it if necessary, then tell the LLM to write the code and verify the test passes, check the code, tell the LLM what to fix, repeat until good, then tell the LLM to write the commit message (which I also review), then tell it to commit and push.

Who says they push to production? I&#39;d hope Spotify has a test system and possibly a CI pipeline. I still don&#39;t think you should have to code on the way to work.

Anthropic was putting out a lot of PR just before their capital raise. Maybe they bribed Spotify to join in?Anyway, the raise was successful, so hopefully the hype will die down for a while.

It&#39;s plausible that they didn&#39;t write any code because they&#39;re still coming back from a Christmas vacation.

Engineers can fix bugs or add features to the iOS app from Slack on their phones during their morning commute and receive a new version of the app pushed to Slack before arriving at the office.This makes Spotify the most awful workplace on the planet for suggesting (even if not demanding), that employees should be working during commute.But also, this makes it the most poorly managed software shop. They&#39;re expecting employees to do away with being serious, and carelessly push updates &quot;from Slack during commute&quot;. AI apart, you&#39;d think he wants his engineers to at least pay attention to what they&#39;re doing. No way this attitude can end up well for the product.

You had the power before and didn&#39;t get a union when you had a chance.

ANY time you spend working you should be paid.  The CEO gets paid a million per week and nothing anybody does is really worth that; even if they &quot;work&quot; long hours... but we are supposed to work on all our free time.

This makes Spotify the most awful workplace on the planet for suggesting (even if not demanding), that employees should be working during commute.Well yes, but you never asked what this means for the employee. I&#39;m perfectly happy being expected to work during my commute providing that the commute is considered working hours. In fact I would prefer this outcome.But who am I kidding, they are just another greedy corp.

If you can do all of your work while commuting then why commute at all?  Obviously does not matter where you sit.

...so all guns are out and blazing. Propaganda is more aggressive with every passing moment.

Because so many bosses will have to answer very hard questions about vast quantities of money once it bursts.

Oh so that&#39;s why Spotify stopped working and some of the features disappeared. Awesome, I expect the next revision to just be a big ol&#39; Play button with no other interface at all.

If I was one of the best devs, I wouldnâ(TM)t want to be regulated to vibe coding.

Maybe I just weird in that I actually enjoy solving problems and trying to think of the way things are put together?

You mean that obnoxious, always-on-top-of-the-page AI DJ that literally nobody wants?

I mean this is just a bullshit metric: Declare &quot;the best&quot; to be those that have not written code, then claim the best have not written code.

Yeah, noticed that too, he felt the need to clarify &#39;best&#39;. That sounds super odd, why would specifically only the best be able to claim that? I would have assumed it more likely for lower level developers to claim that achievement. So if you have some people writing code but only the &#39;best&#39; not writing code....

Of course, I suspect it&#39;s like some executive I recently dealt with who felt that &#39;developers&#39; were beneath him until they left that stupid &#39;coding&#39; behind and became just executives. So he would be

C&#39;mon, Linus, why won&#39;t you accept &quot;my&quot; kernel updates? ;)

The best developers spend their time herding other developers, in meetings, and jabbering with management.  I&#39;ve worked for lots of companies and for a lead developer to say they haven&#39;t touched a line of code in months sounds right, AI or not!

To properly review code, you need a full-sized screen. I don&#39;t believe this story, it&#39;s nothing but hype.

Should I stock up on popcorn, for the next security exploit for Spotify? :)

I hope their &quot;engineers&quot; are spending time auditing the code that is generated by AI and used in production... otherwise, this could be very career limiting for them.

It is one thing for a state to say that it is dedicated to doing justice in capital cases. It is quite another for them to turn those commitments into action.

All too frequently, in those cases, words don’t govern actions. We say we are in favor of equal treatment but stand by while race shapes the fates of those accused of capital crimes. We say that we will not punish cruelly, but use methods of execution that impose unnecessary suffering on those we execute.

Earlier this month, Charles Flores filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court offering it the chance to change that by saying that Texas has to fulfill promises it has made to death row inmates. In his case, he wants to take advantage of a law that allows death row inmates to prove they were falsely convicted and are actually innocent.

The court should hear his case and require the Lone Star State to follow its own laws.

Charles Flores was convicted of the January 1998 killing of Betty Black during an attempted robbery. Right from the start, he has maintained his innocence.

His co-defendant, Richard Childs, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2016.

One of the witnesses who helped convict Flores was Jill Barganier, Betty Black’s neighbor, who insisted at Flores’ trial that she was 100 percent sure she had seen him enter Black’s house the morning she was killed. Her testimony proved to be decisive in securing his conviction since there was no physical evidence tying Flores to the murder.

We know that eyewitness identification is notoriously unreliable. In addition, the neighbor’s testimony was tainted in several ways.

First, on the day of the crime, she told police that two white men with long hair and similar builds got out of a car, a purple and pink Volkswagen Bug, and entered Black’s garage. She then picked a white male with long hair out as the driver she had seen.

But Flores looks nothing like that man. He is Hispanic, not white, and at the time that Black died, he had shaved hair and was overweight.

Bargainer also helped a police artist create a composite sketch of the men whom she saw enter Black’s house. It looked nothing like Flores.

To top it all off, she did not pick a picture of Flores out of an array of photos. So how could she go from all that to being sure Flores was involved in Black‘s killing?

She was helped along by what is called “investigative hypnosis.” A 1979 article published in the journal Detective describes it as a technique used to “obtain vital information that may have been forgotten.” Even then, though, the publication cautioned that “all leads developed through hypnosis should be verified with supporting physical or testimonial evidence … and investigative conclusion should not be based solely on hypnotically obtained information.”

Since that article was published, investigative hypnosis has been shown to be completely unreliable. “Instead of improving memory,” the Christian Science Monitor notes, “hypnosis may only manipulate it.”

That seems to have been the case with Barganier. During her hypnosis, the police asked her if one of the men she had seen had short, shaved hair.

During the hypnosis session, Barganier again described the man she saw driving the car as having “long, wavy” dark-blond hair. The hypnotist then asked her about the passenger and urged her to focus on his hair. She said it was “a lot like his friend’s,” and clarified: “dark, long.”

“Just relax,” the hypnotist said, “take a deep breath, take the time you need. Can you tell me how long his hair is? Does he have it neatly cut, or is it trimmed?”

That is a classic example of a suggestive question.

Even without such overt leading of a witness, courts in many places, including Florida, one of America’s leading death penalty states, have questioned “the reliability of statements procured by way of hypnosis.” A California court explained the danger of investigative hypnosis this way. Someone subject to hypnosis “will lose his critical judgment and begin to credit ‘memories’ that were formerly viewed as unreliable … will confuse actual recall with confabulation and will be unable to distinguish between the two, and … will exhibit an unwarranted confidence in the validity of his ensuing recollection.”

In 2023, Texas recognized that such defects were present in investigative hypnosis. It joined a “majority of jurisdictions, which ban post-hypnotic testimony.”

The Texas criminal code now says that a statement made during or after investigative hypnosis “is not admissible against a defendant in a criminal trial, whether offered in the guilt or innocence phase or the punishment phase of the trial, if the hypnotic session giving rise to the statement was performed by a law enforcement agency to investigate the offense that is the subject of the trial.”

But it was not made to apply to cases in which someone had already been convicted at the time was passed. That in itself should raise red flags.

A state decides that a kind of evidence is so unreliable that it should not be used in any criminal case, but is willing to see someone put to death when that kind of evidence was used to convict him. What kind of justice is that?

Crucially, the issue facing the Supreme Court is whether Texas is obliged to revisit this case. Texas has passed laws specifically designed to protect innocent people from wrongful execution. They allow prisoners to return to court by filing a writ of habeas corpus and present evidence of their innocence.

It also has a law on the books allowing courts to use a lower standard of proof in cases involving junk science.

Flores wants to take advantage of those laws. As he points out in his petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, he has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to allow him the chance to prove that he is in fact innocent of the crime for which Texas seeks to execute him.

But,” he contends, “the TCCA has repeatedly and arbitrarily barred these efforts without explanation.” By doing so, the court is, in essence, nullifying state law and depriving him of “the state-created liberty interest upon which he seeks to rely.”

“Due process,” his petition observes, “demands more than unexplained summary dismissal in response to a substantial threshold showing of actual innocence. This case and the question it presents are exceptionally important: whether a state law enacted to safeguard against executing the innocent, when rendered illusory in practice, offends the federal right to due process.”

“Once a right is established through state law,” Flores argues, “a deprivation of the right implicates federal procedural due process protection.”

He accuses the state of “gratuitously barring credibly innocent prisoners on death row from proving their innocence. This Court,” he adds, “should grant certiorari to clarify that the constitutional guarantee of due process prohibits state courts employing arbitrary or irrational procedures to foreclose even making the case of innocence.”

More than 50 years ago, the Supreme Court recognized what it called “statutory entitlements.” As Justice William Brennan put it, when the state creates a right for a class of individuals, it may not deny an individual seeking to exercise that right without “procedural due process.”

Quoting an earlier case, he noted, “’The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.’”

That is all Charles Flores is asking for, an “opportunity to be heard” on a life-and-death matter. If the Supreme Court does not give him that chance, it will add to the long list of instances when the law promises one thing but doesn’t deliver it to death row inmates.

Is Justice Samuel Alito getting ready to call it quits? A flurry of recent hints has prompted new speculation that the Supreme Court’s most reliably partisan conservative is eyeing the exits in advance of the 2026 midterms. On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern sift through the clues, politics, and legacy management that may be driving Alito toward retirement. They also game out whom President Donald Trump might pick—among the many MAGA judges already campaigning for the seat—as the justice’s possible successor. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Our friend Elie Mystal wrote a great piece in the Nation saying he thinks Alito is going to step down. Our friends at Strict Scrutiny have also suggested as much. Mark, what’s your gossipy buzz telling you?

Mark Joseph Stern: I agree. And the first reason is the announcement of the justice’s forthcoming memoir, which is pompously titled So Ordered: An Originalist’s View of the Constitution, the Court, and Our Country. Of course, justices do publish books on the bench. But there are some indications that this particular release will be a farewell postscript for Alito’s service. First, it’s coming out on Oct. 6, which is one day after the Supreme Court’s next term begins. As Elie noted, it is unusual for the justices to publish books in October because they like to promote their books, and they can’t do that when they’re stuck in D.C., hearing oral arguments. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett all published recent books in early September—timing that makes sense because that’s when the public is starting to pay attention again. The new term is gearing up, but the justices are not stuck in Washington. They are still free to fly around the country, plugging their latest release. I think it’s pretty unlikely that Alito would drop his memoir on a date when he specifically cannot do that.

Second, Alito just celebrated the 20th anniversary of his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Conservative lawyers and pundits marked the occasion by publishing laudatory articles that had, to me, a distinctly valedictory feel to them. That includes at least one former clerk who may well be in contact with the justice and even have an inkling of his plans. On top of that, Alito gave this rare interview to Politico, which surprised me given that it was Politico that published the leak of his Dobbs draft opinion. So you’d think he might have a grudge. Anyway, in that interview, he seemed to look back over his service and view Dobbs as his finest achievement, almost like the capstone of his tenure. He also hinted that he was not really enjoying the job or the coarse civic culture of our current moment.

Finally, there’s another book coming out, this one by Mollie Hemingway, a MAGA pseudo-journalist, called Alito: The Justice Who Reshaped the Supreme Court and Restored the Constitution. It’s going to be this obsequious, bootlicking celebration of Alito’s brilliance. The publisher’s description calls it “the authoritative—and explosive—inside story of Justice Samuel Alito and his powerful role in shaping the Supreme Court.” It seems highly probable that Alito gave interviews to Hemingway, even if it was on background. It feels to me as if he is trying to secure his legacy within the conservative legal movement and the conservative media, which is what matters most to him. And I think that the main reason he would be doing that is because he’s ready to step down and pass the torch.

I was struck by the fact that in the Politico interview, Alito said he wished Justice Antonin Scalia were around to take a victory lap, because the court has achieved so much of what he worked toward and is now finally on the right track. It’s so sad he’s missing it. Within a paragraph, Alito then suggested that Scalia would have been “appalled” by the ugliness, the coarseness of the discourse. Well, who was single-handedly responsible for coarsening the discourse at the Supreme Court for a very long time? Why, it was Scalia! He’d be loving the discourse right now. He built it.

I also think this love story about originalism from Alito feels a little cynical. You and I have spent a lot of time discussing whether Alito really is an originalist or if whether is perfectly result-oriented and completely political. Either way, I guess the better question isn’t what Alito calls himself but what he does. If he does step down soon, won’t it probably be because he wants Trump to replace him while Republicans hold the Senate?

Alito is not an originalist. In fact, he’s made fun of originalism before. His jurisprudence is completely aligned with the Republican Party platform. He watches Fox News. I’m sure he reads the polls. He must know there is a real chance that Republicans could lose the Senate in the fall—which, of course, means that he would be stuck on the bench for at least two more years, maybe six more years, maybe even longer.

And we know that his wife, Martha-Ann, has been counting the minutes until Alito can retire so she can fly whatever flag she wants to.

Martha-Ann definitely wants him to step down. And Alito saw how Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a bad bet and wound up getting replaced by a successor who is torching her legacy. He doesn’t want that to happen. He is savvy enough to know that stepping down before the midterms means that Trump can replace him with someone who is just as conservative, if not more so. Republicans have a comfortable margin in the Senate. Retiring now could cement his jurisprudence for years to come with a mini-Alito who is 30 years younger. That’s probably what is guiding his decision more so than anything else. But in fairness, when we give justices life tenure, we empower them to make these kinds of partisan decisions. You can hate the game, but you can’t really hate the player.

Who do you think could potentially inherit the mantle of the man who gave us witchburners as the reason to overturn Roe v. Wade?

I will throw out two names: Emil Bove, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, and Andy Oldham, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. I flag Bove because he has already proved his absolute fealty to Trump—first as his personal lawyer, then at the Justice Department, when he struck the corrupt bargain to drop criminal charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, defied court orders barring the illegal deportation of Venezuelan migrants, and reportedly helped kill the investigation into Tom Homan’s alleged acceptance of a bribe. We know that Trump was disappointed in his first three picks because he felt as if they weren’t sufficiently loyal to him. With Bove, he wouldn’t have to worry about that.

At the same time, I can imagine that the White House might not want to reopen Bove’s scandals or give Democrats an opportunity to probe them. He’s already gotten his reward with a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit. So, to my mind, Oldham is the more likely candidate. He’s a former Alito clerk and a MAGA fanatic who has gone very far out of his way to campaign for this seat with a constant stream of Trump-pandering opinions. He’s even further right than Alito, who has overruled him multiple times. He also looks the part, which may seem like a shallow observation, but we know that that is important to this president. I think he has a leg up on his colleague James Ho, who has also been campaigning for the seat, because Ho will not look the part to this president. If I had to put money down, I’d say Oldham will be the pick, because he’s got the far-right jurisprudence and he looks like the MAGA justice from central casting in Donald Trump’s dreams.

I think you’re aiming way too high in selecting actual sitting judges for this. I’m going to go with Lindsey Halligan and Jeanine Pirro. I know central casting is the most important phrase for Trump when selecting someone. But I also think the “Own the Libs” vibe is such that it could be Kash Patel. You seemed to suggest that gravitas at some level is important. And I’m not sure it’s going to be.

There was a moment, when the tech CEOs and media moguls were lining up to kiss Trump’s ring, when it looked like almost all the demographic arrows were pointing right, where it looked like Trumpism was, if not widely embraced, at least too big to be written off. After a year of Trump back in office, the culture cries out for Woke 2.0.

It has been a year since J.D. Vance went to Europe and chose (rhetorical) violence.

At the Munich Security Conference last February, the vice president described Europe’s greatest threat as one “from within,” chiding its leadership for suppressing national speech and political participation, especially of anti-immigrant, anti-EU movements. Vance’s hostility, combined with some hypocrisy, shocked leaders: They’d expected a lecture from the incoming administration, but maybe on defense spending. Instead, Vance’s position suggested a more profound rupture in the trans-Atlantic relationship, one where the U.S.’s commercial tech interests and ideological affinity for Europe’s far right were coalescing into a broader attack on European sovereignty.

In the year since, the rift has widened, as the Trump administration and its allies have found common cause with Europe’s far right. In early February, the House GOP Judiciary Committee accused Europe of a “decade-long” campaign to censor the global internet, including by using its regulatory power to “silence political opposition.” European far-right leaders and political parties seized on these claims. “So maybe without interference of the EU we could have won the elections in 2025,” Geert Wilders, the leader of Party of Freedom, a Dutch far-right party, wrote on X.

It’s part of a broader effort between the MAGA movement, including Donald Trump and his allies, and the European populist right to frame the European Union as stifling free speech, particularly on U.S. tech platforms. Prominent voices in American Big Tech, most notably Elon Musk, have long opposed Europe’s attempts at moderating these platforms, and that has converged with the Trump administration’s deepening antagonism toward the European Union.

Now, American and European leaders are back in Munich starting Friday, with even more baggage between them: defense, Ukraine, tariffs, Trump’s designs on Greenland. All, or just one, could be fatal for a nearly 80-year partnership. But the U.S.’s push against what it perceives as censorship points to a more foundational break, one where the U.S. is more openly hostile to the European project and is actively seeking to destabilize European governance.

“In the past, people talked about how the liberal democratic shared value base was a glue for the trans-Atlantic relationship, even at times when perhaps strategic interests were diverging,” said Leonard A. Schütte, an international security program fellow at the Harvard Belfer Center. “Now we have divergent strategic interests and a diverging ideological value base. I’m extremely worried about the future of the trans-Atlantic relationship given those two fundamental forces.”

There are two components to these diverging ideological values. The first is a U.S. and European divide on how to manage tech and social platforms, including content moderation, data transparency, and privacy rules. This kind of policy split is not unusual, and past U.S. administrations—including Obama and Trump I—sometimes pushed back against Europe’s efforts to rein in American tech companies. But this Trump administration has framed such regulations as illiberal suppression of political speech and populist opposition movements. That has turned a divergence on how the European Union does tech policy into a more sweeping indictment of how Europe does democracy.

The particular boogeyman of the moment is the Digital Services Act, which fully went into effect in 2024, and broadly regulates large internet platforms—like Musk’s X or Meta’s Facebook—by asking those giants to remove content that would be illegal under EU or national laws, while also putting in procedures for users to challenge decisions. It pushes for greater accountability on things like advertising practices. Musk has declared all-out war on the DSA, in part because X came under the law’s scrutiny pretty quickly. In December, X was fined 120 million euros for violations after an investigation around the lack of transparency around who now had blue check-mark accounts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the fine on Musk’s X “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.”

Andrew Peek, the director of the Adrienne Arsht National Security Resilience Initiative of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center, and former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council under Trump, said that many in the administration and close to it are scarred from the COVID-19 pandemic and the politics around it, which they saw as a time of government overreach that shut down dissenting views on social media. “This really resonates very deeply, this systemic concern with political freedom and how easily it’s snuffed out,” Peek said. “I don’t want to sound hyperbolic—because it does sound hyperbolic—but I think this is legitimate. This is the way people feel.”

For a U.S. looking at Europe, Peek added, “it is perceived by us as an external interference in national elections and national politics, usually to the detriment of what the Trump administration would see as ideologically simpatico groups.”

Across Europe, freedom-of-speech laws are less absolutist than in the U.S., including a stricter approach to hate speech, born out of its history from World War II. But MAGA and those simpatico groups in Europe claim that is making them a target for their legitimate views, particularly on migration. “The European right-wing parties have tried to frame this, and the U.S. fight against increased platform regulation in Europe, as a fight against their positions—as a fight against their political combat to gain power,” said Jacob Ross, research fellow at the European Center at the German Council on Foreign Relations.

Ross said the MAGA movements, including parts of the administration, and certain European right-wing movements (like Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland) or those in power (like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán) see themselves aligned in wanting to change the trans-Atlantic and the Western status quo. “That’s an ideological common ground that exists and that certain elements of the U.S. government try to exploit,” he said, though he added it can get a bit awkward when the U.S. does things—like threaten to invade Greenland—that put these nationalistic parties in a tough spot. “That forced many European right-wing populists to distance themselves, to underline that they have their country’s interests in mind, European interests in mind,” Ross said, “while at the same time still hoping for some kind of support, certainly through the networks, and maybe money-wise as well, from these U.S. forces.”

Riccardo Alcaro, research coordinator and head of the global actors program at the Istituto Affari Internazionali, said that wing of MAGA—most closely associated with Vance and tech bros, like Musk, and Vance ally Peter Thiel—see Europe as an “object of almost resentful nostalgia,” because they believe it is betraying its cultural, religious (meaning Christian), and ethnic roots. Or as the White House’s National Security Strategy put it: “We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation.”

Linking regulation and civilization makes this existential for MAGA and its right-wing allies in Europe. That will likely make it harder for the U.S. to work constructively with Europe on legitimate concerns about, say, the regulatory burdens or even on censorship of political speech. Critics, for example, have raised concerns about its approach to disinformation during emergencies. But the United States is deploying a blunt, all-or-nothing approach. It sanctioned a former EU official that the State Department called the “mastermind” behind the DSA. The Financial Times reported that the State Department will fund MAGA-aligned think tanks, including to help undermine the DSA. Bram Vranken, a researcher and campaigner at the Corporate Europe Observatory, noted that Big Tech, including Meta and Google, have increased their lobbying of far-right groups in the European parliament. “They’re building a bridge between the Trump administration and the European far right,” he added.

This leaves the European Union and many of its leaders in another impossible bind, not unlike the one it’s facing on its defense amid the Trump administration’s flagging commitment to NATO and the president’s desire to coerce an ally to hand over its territory. When it comes to tech, as with defense, Europe is deeply, deeply reliant on American services. The European Digital SME Alliance, a trade group, said almost 80 percent of Europe’s digital tech is imported. What is more, America’s increasing hostility is raising concerns that if the U.S. took aggressive action—over Greenland, say—it could potentially wield that tech dependency as leverage, cutting off access and crippling European critical infrastructure.

“What [the Trump] administration has done is that they have really created a kind of Sputnik moment, where the Europeans realize now that this decoupling, or de-risking, from American technology is inevitable,” said Anu Bradford, a leading scholar on EU regulation at Columbia Law School.

But this realization comes with another: Right now, Europe has few alternatives. France announced that a French videoconferencing platform will replace American services for its government departments, but with the target date of 2027, according to ABC News. Aura Salla, member of the European Parliament from Finland in the European People’s Party, said there is a growing acceptance that Europe needs technological sovereignty. But, she added, “it will take time.”

Europe has been a very, very good market for American tech, which underscores the risk of the Trump administration’s blunt use of leverage with its European partners. Yet Europe isn’t a market Big Tech will quietly walk away from, either. Evelyn Austin, the executive director of Bits of Freedom, an Amsterdam-based digital rights organization, put it this way: “Reliance brings problems—and getting out of that reliance brings risks.”

Austin said she thinks Europe should identify this reliance as a national security threat, which might empower countries to accelerate that decoupling.

“What I find really daunting is the consequences or implications of that,” Austin said. “You’re walking into a very, very conflictual relationship with the U.S.—and that terrifies me. But I’m not sure if there’s any way around it. Aren’t we actually already there?”

There are many things for Europeans to worry about as they watch the Trump administration blow up the international order. There is the chaos of having international markets careening around the whims of one man. There is the ominous talk from an aggressive superpower lusting over Greenland. There is the catastrophic dismantling of efforts to rally the world to address the climate crisis.

But for certain European countries, Donald Trump poses a threat that taps into a more intimate and sickeningly primal fear: that Americans will force-feed them our disgusting chicken. Specifically, our “chlorine chicken,” Europe’s term for American chemically washed poultry.

“EXCLUSIVE: UK-US Trade Deal: Keep Your Chlorine Chicken America, Britain Must Not Pay This Price,” read one British headline from May. “Don’t Like the Idea of Chlorinated Chicken? You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet,” read another.

The panic over “chlorine chicken” is a noble British tradition that reappears every time the public considers the prospect of deepening its economic entanglement with the U.S. This particular European bogeyman dates back to 2014, when the U.S. and the European Union were negotiating a trans-Atlantic trade agreement. All the European countries shared the U.S. poultry aversion at the time: Germany calls it, we’re happy to report, chlorhühnchen. But the U.K. has more justification for its fears these days, as Brexit left its regulations more open to adjustment.

Now, the nation is in the grip of its latest chicken panic: British media have reported that the Trump administration is once again pressuring the U.K. to concede some of its food standards. In December, the Telegraph reported an alarming story with the headline “White House Demands British Supermarkets Stock Chlorinated Chicken.” According to the report, it all came down to a $40 billion technology agreement the White House had scrapped with the U.K. That failed deal was part of a cluster of agreements between the two nations meant to supplement the larger deal from May, which had excluded some economic sectors. The tech deal would have set terms for the nations’ collaboration over artificial intelligence and quantum computing. But in December, the White House quashed the deal, citing displeasure with the U.K.’s online safety rules, its digital services tax—and, strangely, food safety rules.

As the Telegraph described the negotiations, the U.S. trade envoy had been quite pointed about the food safety matter, particularly as it related to poultry and beef. Even though the deal had nothing to do with food, if the country wanted to revive it—something that promised significant investment from the U.S.—it would need to get over its squeamishness.

The British people don’t care for this. According to the British agricultural press, more than 150,000 Brits have since signed petitions urging their supermarket chains to “publicly rule out chlorinated chicken.” The angst lingers into the new year. It appears that the British public is realizing that fending the chlorine chicken off once doesn’t mean it won’t pop right back up as a matter of debate: As Trump has continued to toy with the global financial order, American unpredictability has changed the nature of this particularly British anxiety. No longer does the poultry panic emerge just for agricultural trade deals; Trump has made “chlorinated chicken” a permanent low-level threat, a dark, feathered cloud hovering over the British Isles. Thanks to Trump’s reputation for capriciousness, the great poultry panic may just be here to stay.

To be clear, “chlorine” is not a fully accurate word to describe American chicken; per the National Chicken Council, less than 5 percent of American chicken is treated with chlorine. Nowadays, the industry uses more effective cleaners, such as peracetic acid, a kind of all-purpose antimicrobial agent used in hospital cleaners, produce washes, and meat processing.

The data remain unclear as to whether the American method is actually that much worse, but the problem is more one of the general imagination: In the British mind, their chickens (and all other livestock) are dutifully cared for in sanitary, healthy conditions from birth to slaughter, keeping them disease-free from the start. Our chickens, on the other hand, are treated abominably, packed in tightly with their germy brethren, raised in squalor, pumped with hormones, and only made clean at the end. It’s a matter of washing off the filth—with unnatural chemicals, at that—versus never picking up the filth in the first place. This picture gives the Brits the heebie-jeebies. It’s not a fully accurate picture, as the British do still have factory farms, but it’s true that their standards for animal welfare are higher and that they don’t use nearly as many antibiotics. And it’s also true that their food safety philosophy about keeping away contamination at all stages is entirely different from the American fix-it-later mentality.

It was this cultural gag reflex that caused the specter of American chicken to become a major point of contention during Brexit, when people became worried the renegotiated trade deals would make their own food-safety attitudes vulnerable to assault from our population’s street-rat standards. Indeed, the U.S. tried: In 2019, BuzzFeed News reported that the first Trump administration was offering to pay up to $92,000 to have British journalists brought in on a tour of U.S. farms, with the goal of addressing “misconceptions” about chlorinated chicken.

The Brits warded off the American chicken then, but only after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the leader of the Labour Party a “gigantic chlorinated chicken.” Then, as now, everyone across all ideological lines feared the chicken; accusing political opponents of being soft on chlorine chicken is a legitimate attack. When Nigel Farage, a Trump ally, argued that the U.K. should allow chlorinated chicken (the British already ate questionable chicken from Thailand, he argued), it was a minor scandal. In 2023, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak solemnly vowed there would “be no chlorine-washed chicken and no hormone-treated beef on the U.K. market. Not now, not ever.”

But the Americans have fought for the chicken. Most recently, when the U.S. and U.K. negotiated a new trade deal last spring, the Trump White House did, indeed, try to bully the country into adjusting its food standards. The White House called them “non-science-based standards that severely restrict U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry products.” (Headlines: “Trump Tells UK to Buy Their Chlorinated Chicken if They Want Tariff Relief.”) White House adviser Peter Navarro tried to assert that the Brits were missing out on a “very fine American agricultural product,” and “we don’t believe that once they taste American beef and chicken that they would prefer not to have it.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to reassure the public that the government wouldn’t budge on this, and thanks to pressure from constituents, it didn’t.

But this bowel-clenching British fear didn’t simply disappear. Trump has continued to harangue the country about food standards, even after the Brits thought they’d struck a chlorine-free deal less than a year ago. And that’s the bigger problem: Alliances depend on trust, and the U.S. can no longer be trusted to keep its word—even when it comes to not forcing our icky chicken on Europeans.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon inched closer to its atomic datacenter dream on Friday after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed its small modular reactor partner X-energy to make nuclear fuel for advanced reactors at a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

The approval clears yet another hurdle to the commercial rollout of these miniaturized reactors by major bit barn operators. Amazon became one of the first to embrace the yet unproven tech in late 2024 when it made a $500 million bet on X-Energy&#39;s Xe-100 reactors to end its reliance on the power grid and fuel its datacenter growth.

X-Energy&#39;s license under 10 CFR part 70 enables its subsidiary TRISO-X to manufacture the high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel pellets that will eventually power that reactor.

The company boasts its TX-1 and TX-2 fuel plants are the first such facilities to receive approval in half a century, though we&#39;ll note they&#39;re not exactly finished. X-Energy expects to complete construction of the first site later this year, and it can&#39;t start churning out pellets until it passes an on-site inspection by the NRC to ensure it&#39;s safe.

For safety&#39;s sake, the enriched uranium is formed into small TRISO fuel particles coated in multiple layers of carbon and ceramic materials, which are then embedded in graphite to form pebbles roughly the size of a billiard ball. Hundreds of thousands of these pebbles will be circulated through the reactor continuously. In the case of the Xe-100, heat generated by this process will be captured using helium gas and then used to produce steam to drive a turbine.

Each Xe-100 reactor is expected to produce up to 80 megawatts of power continuously for 60 years. For context, that&#39;s enough to power the typical AWS campuses of yesteryear, although the honkin&#39; GPU-cranking datacenters of the putative AI boom are slated to use up to 50 times that much.

X-Energy expects to produce roughly 700,000 pebbles a year at its TX-1 site, enough for around 11 reactors. Its TX-2 site, which is currently in the design phase, is expected to dramatically increase production.

While a step toward energy independence, Amazon will be waiting a while longer to get its hands on the tech. X-Energy expects to deliver the five gigawatts of power contracted by Amazon &quot;by&quot; 2039, with the first reactors coming online sometime in the 2030s. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/14/servicenow_buys_pyramid_analytics_to/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite its CEO&#39;s insistence that it wasn&#39;t doing any &quot;large scale&quot; deals soon, ServiceNow has acquired yet another company. This time, the software firm has scooped up Pyramid Analytics, an Israeli corporation with data science and preparation expertise. The goal is to build additional context and semantics into its software stack.

“Pyramid adds an analytics and semantic layer that can define metrics in a way that both humans and AI agents can rely on,” Forrester VP and Principal Analyst Charles Betz told The Register Friday. “Natural‑language querying is one expression of that, but the deeper value for customers is moving analytics closer to action — embedding trusted, shared meaning directly into workflows, suitable for agentic automation, rather than treating semantics as purely a design time problem and analytics as a downstream reporting use case.”

Grabbing Pyramid Analytics is the latest in a string of acquisitions that ServiceNow is using to build a software stack that goes from ingesting tickets and monitoring workflows to using knowledge graphs to understand the what and why behind objects that appear in a customers&#39; CMDBs. The company’s purchase of Data.World and Veza are other examples of this direction.

“The most important signal is less about natural‑language query per se and more about semantics,” Betz said.

ServiceNow said that when Pyramid Analytics’ capabilities are brought into the fold, customers will be able to turn its dashboards that display information into action within the system.

“For example, AI-driven insights can automatically surface an issue, open and route a case, recommend the next best actions, and drive resolution across IT and the business — all in one connected workflow,” wrote Guarav Rewari, general manager and senior vice president of data analytics in a blog that announced the deal.

Pyramid will provide “canonical” definitions for a business which will allow humans and AI agents to take more confident action on business decisions across the customer’s IT estate, Rewarit wrote. He said it lets ServiceNow break out of the domain-specific use cases and connect to data outside of ServiceNow’s traditional remit.

“We’ll use Pyramid Analytics to deliver high-value solutions across IT, HR, supply chain, and other areas, combining data connectivity, AI-powered queries, workflow automation, and trusted governance,” Rewari wrote.

News of the acquisition came about two weeks after company CEO Bill McDermott told investors the company had no more “large scale” M&A deals planned during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call.

“And as it relates to future M&A, we do not have a large-scale M&A on the road map,&quot; he said. “What happened, and I felt for you all, we had Moveworks. It took 9 months to close. We no sooner closed Moveworks … and then had Armis and Veza come to you within like a few days. So probably, it was a little bit what&#39;s going on over there at ServiceNow? And I noticed that we lost about $10 billion in market cap on that because of the worry. So now the worry is gone, you can give us back to market cap.”

Since that Jan. 28 call, ServiceNow’s share price has dropped an additional 8.27 percent.

Financial details of the Pyramid Analytics transaction were not disclosed. A ServiceNow spokesperson told The Register that this purchase was not material to financial results and described it as a “tuck-in.”

“Pyramid is a smaller, strategic tuck-in that strengthens our data and analytics capabilities,” the spokesperson said. “It is not material to our business.”

Betz said that, while the “optics are not the best,” when McDermott made those comments the deal was likely almost closed.

“I took Bill McDermott’s comments as aimed at very large, balance‑sheet‑shaping transactions,” Betz told The Register. “Pyramid appears materially smaller than deals like Armis, more targeted rather than a broad portfolio bet. In that sense, it’s consistent with a strategy of filling specific gaps rather than pursuing transformational M&A. Also, timing. Bill said that just a few weeks back; the Pyramid deal was presumably way too far done to reverse.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Can using AI teach you to code more quickly than traditional methods? Anthropic certainly thinks so. The AI outfit has partnered with computer science education org CodePath to get Claude and Claude Code into the hands of students, a time-tested strategy for seeding product interest and building brand loyalty.

The project aims to Claude-ify more than 20,000 students at community colleges, state schools, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

According to Anthropic, more than 40 percent of CodePath students come from families earning less than $50,000 a year, a nod to the less privileged who may not be able to afford college without financial assistance.

&quot;We now have the technology to teach in two years what used to take four,&quot; said Michael Ellison, co-founder and CEO of CodePath, in a statement. &quot;But speed for some and not others just widens inequality. Partnering with Anthropic means our students learn to build with Claude from day one, at institutions that have historically been overlooked. This results in better outcomes for our students and a fundamentally different answer to who gets to shape the AI economy.&quot;

We question whether access to Claude will empower economically disadvantaged students to &quot;shape the AI economy.&quot; Entering the workforce with some knowledge of Claude should enable participation in the AI economy – certainly a win if the Claude-deprived find jobs scarce. But shaping the AI economy remains the privilege of corporations and billionaires, of those throwing cash at computing infrastructure, politicians, and public relations.

CodePath plans to integrate Claude into various programming courses to give students experience building projects with AI tools and contributing to open source projects – at least the ones that allow AI-generated code submissions.

CodePath students have been pilot testing Claude Code, to good effect, it&#39;s claimed. Anthropic reports that Laney Hood, CodePath student and computer science major at Texas Tech University, had nice things to say about its software.

&quot;Claude Code was instrumental in my learning process, especially since I came into the project with very little experience in the programming languages used in the repository [including TypeScript and Node.js],&quot; said Hood.

At the start of the personal computer revolution in the 1980s, companies like Apple and Microsoft worked to get their products into the hands of students, knowing that early familiarity encourages customer retention.

As web and cloud services began to overshadow traditional operating systems as computing gatekeepers, Google adopted a similar strategy by pushing its Chromebook hardware into schools. More recently, Meta has followed suit, with a mixed and virtual reality offering called Meta for Education.

And now, as AI companies strive to make their models chokepoints for computing services, they too are wooing students in the hope of building lasting brands.

OpenAI, last year, announced that it had joined the American Federation of Teachers to help launch the National Academy for AI Instruction, alongside Anthropic and Microsoft. And before that, OpenAI debuted ChatGPT Edu. Meta, meanwhile, has been trying to get its Llama model family into schools through a partnership with Blended Labs.

Anthropic insists that its tie-up with CodePath isn&#39;t just about modernizing the curriculum of computer science. The AI biz says it expects to work with CodePath on public research into the way that AI is changing education and economic opportunities.

Those opportunities – specifically programming jobs – have declined significantly since 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Nonetheless, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says, &quot;Overall employment of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers is projected to grow 15 percent from 2024 to 2034, much faster than the average [of 3 percent] for all occupations.&quot;

There is already ample research on the impact that AI is having on computer science education. Recent papers on the subject tend to be a mixed bag, finding AI assistance can be helpful if properly administered, so long as there&#39;s compensation for the learning lost by offloading cognitive tasks. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Remember that giant green rack-sized blade server Oxide Computer showed off a couple of years back? Well, the startup is still at it, having raked in $200 million in Series-C funding this week as it prepares to bring a bevy of new hardware to market with updated processing power, memory, and networking.

Founded in 2019 by a gaggle of former Joyent and Sun Microsystems engineers, the company set out to make the rack, not the server, the new unit of compute for the datacenter.

The result was a 7.8-foot-tall, 2,518-pound rack system rated for 15 kW of total power draw that runs a completely custom open source software stack.

Inside this behemoth are 32 hyperscale-inspired compute sleds, each packing 64 EPYC cores, up to 1 TB of memory, and 32 TB of NVMe storage, all connected via a backplane that not only provides power but also delivers up to 12.8 Tbps of switching capacity.

However, that system launched two years ago, and, while impressive for its time, many of the Oxide rack&#39;s core components are getting rather long in the tooth.

AMD&#39;s Milan generation of EPYC processors, which powered the original Oxide rack, dates back to March 2021.

As such, the rack system is overdue for an upgrade, and according to CEO Steve Tuck, we&#39;ll be getting one in short order.

The upcoming gear will include a new generation of compute blades powered by AMD&#39;s Turin EPYC, which launched a little over a year ago, boasting core counts of up to 192 cores and support for faster DDR5 6400 MT/s memory — a rather big upgrade over the comparatively glacial DDR4 3200 MT/s memory that shipped in the OG Oxide rack back in 2023.

&quot;Turin gets us back to a good sweet spot where you get lots of cores and with as little wattage drawn as possible,&quot; Tuck tells El Reg.

Oxide hasn&#39;t said which SKUs it has opted for yet, but regardless of core count, the architectural improvements from AMD&#39;s Zen 3 to Zen 5 will be substantial, with an instructions-per-clock increase of more than 30 percent.

Alone that&#39;d be substantial, but it doesn&#39;t take into consideration that Turin clocks much higher than Milan. The 64-core Milan-based Epyc 7713P found in Oxide&#39;s compute blade topped out at 3.67 GHz. By contrast, at that same core count, Turin is capable of hitting 5 GHz, albeit using a fair bit more power and only on a few cores at any one time.

Turin will also bring AVX-512 support to Oxide&#39;s compute platform for the first time. These beefy vectors have become increasingly useful for agentic AI systems, but were completely absent for the Milan generation and were only partially supported on AMD&#39;s Zen 4 EPYC Genoa lineup.

Oxide CTO Bryan Cantrill, whom you may recognize for his time at Sun Microsystems, tells us Oxide ultimately opted to skip Genoa as it wasn&#39;t as compelling from a compute density standpoint compared to Turin, which we&#39;ll note was only about a year from launching when the company&#39;s first rack made its debut.

As we mentioned, the move to Turin will also see Oxide embrace DDR5, assuming it can find adequate supply. If you hadn&#39;t noticed, DDR5 might as well be gold right now.

Alongside the new compute and memory, Oxide is also evaluating new switch silicon to eventually replace the system&#39;s aging Tofino 2-based hardware.

You see, almost a year before the company revealed the Oxide rack to the world, Intel quietly ended development of the Tofino switch line. This posed a problem for Oxide, which had already invested heavily in developing software around the platform.

But rather than shelving the platform, Intel made a rather unusual decision to open source the Tofino P4 compiler.

&quot;It&#39;s almost out of character with Intel, honestly. When Intel kills something, they just kind of want to forget that it ever happened,&quot; Cantrill said. &quot;It was the dedication of the folks inside of Intel that really believed in the programmability [of the platform] that got the P4 compiler open sourced, and that has been essential for us.&quot;

Despite its age, the switch silicon is still more than enough to deliver 200 Gbps (2x 100 GbE links) of bandwidth to each of the Oxide rack&#39;s 32 compute blades.

Tuck also assures us that the company has no shortage of Tofino hardware to keep its existing racks running. &quot;We have got no end in sight to where we will be able to build and deploy and support customers on that architecture,&quot; he said.

But ultimately, Tofino is a dead end platform, one Oxide is already evaluating long-term replacements for. One such option is Xsight Labs&#39; X2 switch silicon. Like Tofino, it is highly programmable while also consuming less than 200 watts of power under load.

However, Tuck tells us the company is also exploring other options as well, though given Oxide&#39;s preference for open hardware, we can&#39;t imagine there are all that many contenders.

One of the things that sets Oxide apart from other hardware vendors is that it doesn&#39;t just rehash reference designs and call it a day. The company has taken a ground up systems approach to building their hardware.

To put into perspective just how weird Oxide really is, the company didn&#39;t just take an off-the-shelf ASPEED and strap it to a motherboard for lights out management like almost every other board maker. Instead, the company built its own service processor from scratch.

And while it initially planned to adapt reference boards for its compute sleds, the company ended up hiring an electrical engineering team to design its own, again from scratch.

&quot;We believe more strongly than ever that what we actually need to develop reliable, scalable systems are our parts silicon that are clearly documented at the lowest layers of interface,&quot; Cantrill said.

Having said that, Oxide had to draw the line somewhere and there are still proprietary blobs inside the Oxide rack. &quot;We haven&#39;t done our own SSD,&quot; Cantrill said.

But while it might not make sense for a startup to develop custom controllers for everything, Cantrill expects the Oxide rack will have fewer of these &quot;proprietary blobs,&quot; not more as it evolves.

One of the driving forces behind Oxide&#39;s decision to build its hardware rather than buy it comes down to visibility.

&quot;The problem that you often have with these proprietary layers is we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on,&quot; Cantrill said. &quot;For customers, it is deeply, deeply frustrating when you have these infrastructure issues.&quot;

With proprietary hardware, Oxide&#39;s options are limited if the supplier can&#39;t figure it out. By prioritizing open, well documented platforms, and building their own hardware where necessary, Oxide hopes to sidestep this problem.

Up to this point, Oxide has largely focused on addressing general purpose compute demand rather than chasing AI riches.

&quot;GPUs are, for sure, on the radar. They&#39;ve always been on the radar from the beginning,&quot; Cantrill said. &quot;I think the thing that has been a big eye-opener for us is the role that general purpose CPU plays in these AI workloads.&quot;

While GPUs and AI accelerators are required to train and run the models, many of the agentic features now grabbing headlines run on CPUs.

&quot;When you&#39;re on your chatbot of choice, and you&#39;re using it to search the web, and you get the little searching the web wheel going around, that is not a GPU that&#39;s searching the web.&quot;

Cantrill says Oxide will offer GPUs at some point, but he argues the company has plenty of work left to do with regard to CPU, storage, and networking to keep it busy for now. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ignore patches at your own risk. According to Uncle Sam, a SQL injection flaw in Microsoft Configuration Manager patched in October 2024 is now being actively exploited, exposing unpatched businesses and government agencies to attack.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added CVE-2024-43468 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog on Thursday, setting a March 5 deadline for federal agencies to deploy the patch.

The 9.8-rated SQL injection vulnerability exists in Microsoft Configuration Manager, which IT admins use to manage organizations&#39; Windows-based servers and laptops. And it allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database. It&#39;s a very serious flaw that needs to be fixed ASAP - or 16 months ago.

Mehdi Elyassa, a red teamer at French cybersecurity firm Synacktiv, found and reported the bug to Microsoft. The Register reached out to Microsoft for comment, but did not immediately receive responses to our questions, so we don&#39;t know who is battering this bug or how many customers are affected. We will update this story when we hear back.

CISA says it&#39;s &quot;unknown&quot; if this CVE has been abused in ransomware attacks.

When it originally disclosed the bug in October 2024, Microsoft deemed it &quot;exploitation less likely,&quot; and the Windows vendor&#39;s security update still lists that vulnerability as not being under attack. Since that time, however, at least two proof-of-concept exploits have been published, so you really should drop everything else and patch this bug before taking off for the long Presidents&#39; Day weekend.

We&#39;re sincerely hoping that all Microsoft admins, or at least those in the US, enjoy the Monday holiday after what has been a very busy second week of February.

On Tuesday, Redmond gifted them with 59 new CVEs, six of which had already been exploited before Microsoft issued a patch.

Per usual, Microsoft did not provide additional details about who attacked these six flaws and how widespread exploitation may be.

Three of the six, however, are also listed as publicly disclosed - meaning there may already be proof-of-concept exploits available. So it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll hear about these CVEs under attack soon, and not a year and a half from now. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has outlined the first 26 goals for its project to inject AI into the government&#39;s scientific research, and everything from securing critical minerals to discovering a unified theory of physics is on the table.

The Department of Energy, which is leading Trump&#39;s Genesis Mission to spur a nationwide effort to incorporate AI into the scientific process at a Manhattan Project-like scale, announced the list of &quot;26 science and technology challenges of national importance&quot; on Thursday. Each was selected, the DoE said, for its potential to deliver actual benefits to America and speed up the Genesis Mission&#39;s general pace of advancement.

&quot;These challenges represent a bold step toward a future where science moves at the speed of imagination because of AI,&quot; said DoE under secretary for science and Genesis Mission lead Darío Gil. &quot;It&#39;s a game-changer for science, energy, and national security.&quot;

Of course, given it&#39;s a federal government project with lofty scientific ambitions that require reliable AI to achieve, there wasn&#39;t a timeline given outside of the DoE saying it wants its AI efforts to &quot;double the productivity and impact of US research and development within a decade.&quot;

The 26-page document listing the various objectives is relatively brief, only describing the challenge, explaining how the DoE wants AI to solve it, justifying its inclusion in the list, and describing its potential national impact.

The goal of &quot;accelerating delivery of nuclear fusion,&quot; for example, says that today&#39;s device-specific trials, isolated from other areas of dependency (e.g., connecting it to the grid, commercialization, etc.), aren&#39;t enough to take fusion out of its perpetual status as always being 30 years away.

Digital twins, says the DoE, would allow physicists to experiment with fusion reactors and their various integrations more consistently, so the Genesis Mission will work on an &quot;AI-Fusion Digital Convergence Platform&quot; to do just that.

The platform envisioned by the Genesis team &quot;will integrate novel algorithms in HPC codes, foundation models for plasma and materials science, physics- and chemistry-informed neural networks, surrogate models, and digital twins for whole-facility modeling and real-time control,&quot; according to the DoE. Simple as that, then.

Many of the projects in the document are similarly vague and open-ended, like &quot;reenvisioning advanced manufacturing and industrial productivity,&quot; &quot;securing US leadership in data centers,&quot; and &quot;achieving AI-driven autonomous laboratories.&quot;

Other goals are a bit more grounded, such as digitizing and structuring more than eight decades of US nuclear data into secure, searchable datasets to inform future energy and security decisions, and applying AI to better predict water needs tied to the country’s expanding energy system. Still, many of the remaining challenges read more like high-level research prompts than deliverables, ambitious whether AI is involved or not.

According to White House office of science and technology policy director Michael Kratsios, the challenge list isn&#39;t stopping at those 26 items. No timeline was given as to when more can be expected.

The Genesis Mission also comes as the Trump administration has slashed scientific funding, eliminated experts, and reduced research budgets across federal government branches, including at the Department of Energy.

The Trump administration’s FY2026 budget request asked Congress to cut DoE’s Office of Science from $8.24 billion in FY2025 to $7.092 billion, and to slash the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) account from $3.46 billion to $888 million. In the case of the Office of Science, Congress declined to adopt the proposed cut, with the FY2026 Energy and Water bill listing roughly $8.4 billion for the office, though other parts of DoE’s energy R&D portfolio still face reductions compared to prior levels.

Regardless of those reprieves, scientific professionals told The Register early in Trump&#39;s second term that they were concerned that the future of US scientific leadership was at stake due to layoffs and cuts. As has been shown in the commercial world, it&#39;s entirely possible AI science will leave the government begging for human researchers to take their jobs back. ®

The DoE has been in touch to tell us that, contrary to the fact that it’s been gutting science funding, the Trump administration isn’t deprioritizing science at all.

“As [Energy] Secretary Wright has said repeatedly, under the Trump administration, the department will prioritize true technological breakthroughs – such as nuclear fusion, high-performance computing, quantum computing, and AI – to maintain America’s global competitiveness,” a DoE spokesperson told The Register. “In other words, more science, less wasteful spending, and less politics involved in the process.”

The spokesperson cited investments in DoE laboratories and science investments in the Big Beautiful Bill as support for the DoE’s claim.

As for when the US may see some of the results of the Genesis Mission, the DoE told us that, while the hope is to double domestic R&D productivity within a decade, “early wins are expected within the next few years as pilot projects demonstrate accelerated breakthroughs in energy, materials science, and advanced manufacturing.”

﻿Chris ‘moot’ Poole tells The Verge he regrets having ever encountered Jeffrey Epstein.

The close timing of Jeffrey Epstein coming into contact with 4chan founder Chris ‘moot’ Poole and the launch of the “politically incorrect” message board /pol/ that became a breeding ground for QAnon and the white supremacist alt-right movement was coincidental, says Poole. In a statement given to The Verge, Pool writes, “The decision to add the board was made weeks beforehand, and the board was added almost 24 hours prior to a first, chance encounter at a social event.”

Speculation about the timing arose after emails found in the millions of documents released by the Department of Justice showed Epstein and venture capitalist Boris Nikolic discussing a meeting between Epstein and moot in 2011, as well as failed attempts to meet later.

But according to moot himself, Epstein had nothing to do with what happened on the site:

Epstein had nothing to do with the reintroduction of a politics board to 4chan, nor anything else related to the site. The decision to add the board was made weeks beforehand, and the board was added almost 24 hours prior to a first, chance encounter at a social event. His assistant reached out to me afterward, and I met with him one time for an unmemorable lunch meeting. This happened at a time when I was meeting hundreds of people a month while speaking and networking at tech events.

I did not meet him again nor maintain contact. I regret having ever encountered him at all, and have deep sympathy for all of his victims.

As we reported on Thursday, while their contact may have been brief, Epstein’s influence continued to intersect with 4chan and the culture it helped produce, through his ongoing connection to former Trump advisor and Breitbart chief Steve Bannon’s efforts to elect Trump and platform far-right figures.

Valentine’s Day is often thought of as the quintessential Hallmark holiday — and why wouldn’t it be? Most of the time, it’s marketed to us with massive floral arrangements and heart-shaped chocolates, both of which can come off as borderline twee. But no one says you have to play by the rulebook when it comes to holidays, especially if your husband or boyfriend couldn’t care less about the classics.

If you’re hoping to express your affection for the man in your life with something a little different this year, we have some thoughts. Quince’s cashmere crewneck is quickly becoming a staple in our closet, while past favorites like Glocusent’s necklamp and Image3D’s custom viewfinder make for excellent substitutes if you want something less cliché. Hell, name a roach after him. We guarantee no one else will.

What follows is an array of Verge-approved ideas spanning multiple categories and price points, so you can easily find a gift for your friend, romantic partner, or any other self-proclaimed “dude” in your life.

From calls to playlists, the AirPods 4 make everything sound a little better. Apple’s latest earbuds deliver improved audio and voice call quality that’s on par with the Pro models, ensuring you come through clearly no matter what’s going on around you. The included charging case even has a built-in speaker, making them juuuust a little harder to lose.

With Hot Ones’ latest trio pack, you can subject your valentine to the same fiery gauntlet that Jason Segel, Will Arnett, and other guests were recently forced to endure. It includes the second, fifth, and final hot sauces in the series — including the iconic “Last Dab,” which is a soul-scorching blend of Apollo, Pepper X, Carolina Reaper, and Scorpion peppers.

Hazelight Studios’ follow-up to It Takes Two is, without a doubt, one of the best co-op games of the last several years. The split-screen mashup of sci-fi and fantasy pinballs between genres at breakneck speed, introducing new ideas and novel gameplay elements at every turn. Now, let’s hope you and your partner have a good working relationship.

Not every massage gun needs to exert an exorbitant amount of pressure. The five-speed Mebak 3 takes a more subtle approach, which, unlike other models, prevents it from drowning out your TV. It’s also unique in that comes with seven (!) distinct add-ons, including a blade-like shovel attachment and a flat cushiony head aimed at more sensitive tissues and joints.

Given the number of books in the world, sometimes it’s nice to have somebody narrow down the list on your behalf. A Book of the Month membership lets your giftee periodically choose from a curated selection of up to seven titles, including literary classics, bestsellers, and early releases spanning a variety of well-known genres.

Nomad’s Leather Mag Wallet is two gifts in one. Not only does the slick snap-on wallet let you store up to four cards at once, but it also doubles as an AirTag, allowing you to locate your wallet via Apple’s Find My network. The magnetic, iPhone-friendly accessory also charges wirelessly, enabling up to five months of battery life.

Your most sentimental photos with your valentine will pack an extra punch with Image3D’s RetroViewer. The retro-styled viewfinder comes with a code to upload seven photos — whether they’re of your first date, wedding, or latest vacay — which you can then edit and package into your own DIY reel for when those nostalgic moments overtake you.

Powerful power banks don’t have to be cumbersome. Iniu’s 10,000mAh P50 is about as thick as a deck of cards, but features 45W charging speeds, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. Its braided lanyard also doubles as a USB-C cable, providing everything you need to keep all of your electronics fully juiced on the go.

Whether your valentine collects Funko Pops or not, gifting them a custom model is sure to delight them. Using an online module, you can fine-tune a variety of features — including their hairstyle, skin tone, and getup — and each custom Funko comes in a box, just like the collectible ones based on Star Wars and other iconic fandoms.

It’s easy enough to run the vacuum in the living room and call it a day. But other areas where your valentine might enjoy spending their time — at the computer, in the car, etc. — can be tougher to clean. That’s where Hoto’s sleek, 20,000Pa handheld vacuum and its slew of attachment heads come in.

Quince is quickly becoming a household name, particularly for wool basics. And if your valentine doesn’t have any cashmere in their collection, the company’s ultra-soft crewneck is a fantastic gift that can keep them warm and stylish during the coldest months of the year. The fact that it’s available in 15 different colors is just a plus.

A subscription to The Criterion Channel is the ultimate gift for a movie lover. The service lets you stream some of the greatest movies of all time, from The Shining to Once Upon a Time in America. It also includes access to Criterion 24/7, an endless stream of movies that you can watch when you don’t want to make a decision.

The past few months might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Nice Cube, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

Let’s face it, many of us have called roaches unsavory things, typically from a place of fear. However, if you want to redeem yourself somehow, the Bronx Zoo will let you name your very own Madagascar hissing cockroach in the name of love. You can even schedule a “virtual encounter” for your giftee, if they’re feeling up for it.

Got a boyfriend or husband who loves to golf? Paper Apps Golf is a pocket-sized game that lets them hit the proverbial green just about anywhere. The 60-page notebook features three randomly generated courses, each with 18 holes, along with a brief overview of how to play. Just be sure to grab a Pencil dice (sold separately) to go with it.

If you’re okay with shelling out on a console, look no further than the Switch 2. Nintendo’s latest hybrid boasts a spacious 7.9-inch display, a comfortable design, and backward compatibility with most OG Switch titles, some of which have even been updated to run at higher resolutions and frame rates. Fair to say, Donkey Kong has never looked better.

Whether you’re relaxing at home or braving the elements, keeping your extremities warm is paramount. Fortunately, Unihand’s rechargeable hand warmers can keep your digits limber for up to 20 hours on a single charge; they also feature three distinct warmth levels, the most powerful of which can hit 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

Apple’s latest AirTags feel purpose-built for the forgetful boyfriend. The second-gen item tracker features an upgraded ultra-wideband chip for more precise location tracking, a noticeably louder speaker, and an expanded Bluetooth range. You’ll still need an iPhone to make the most of it, though, as well as a separate accessory to attach it to your belongings.

Lego’s smiling, potted plants might be intended for kids, but they make for a fun piece of desk decor that’s sure to lighten up any space without requiring additional aftercare. The cutsey duo is easy to assemble, and each plant is interchangeable with either pot, letting you mix and match as you see fit.

Fender has made it easy for guitarists to feel like they’re plugged in wherever they are. The Micro Plus is a compact headphone amp with 50 effects that lets you rock out using the headphones you already own, whether they’re a pair of shoddy earbuds or studio-caliber cans. Best of all, it works with a range of guitar types, from straight-sided to the angular variety.

Attending a dedicated first aid or CPR class through the Red Cross probably isn’t high on your list of date-night activities. However, it’s pretty cool to know that, after a few self-paced online courses and an hour or two of in-person practical instruction, both you and your partner can be heroes should you encounter someone who needs life-saving help.

The key to making a truly spectacular cocktail isn’t just the combination of ingredients — though, we admit that’s part of it. In Liquid Intelligence, Dave Arnold makes the case that the smallest details are what make all the difference, especially in terms of taste and appearance. And who are we to argue with bar-backed science?

What’s mightier than the pen? A pen that can also serve as an LED flashlight, a ruler, a bubble level, a screwdriver, a bottle opener, and a smartphone-ready stylus. The 9-in-1 Builder Pen might just be the most capable tool you can add to your everyday carry, even if you never write a thing with it.

If your partner likes to burn the midnight oil reading, like, actual books, Glocusent’s wearable necklamp could be a godsend. The handy gizmo provides a soft, warm glow and several brightness settings, letting your loved one comfortably read in the dark without waking you up with a deluge of lumens.

Cards Against Humanity is overrated. Wingspan, however, plays as beautifully as it looks, while offering just the right amount of strategy and a unique way to learn about various species. If you and your valentine are looking to move beyond the basics, this bird-themed engine-building board game is a must, whether you like birds or not.

The Amazfit Active 2 is the kind of smartwatch that defies the odds. It’s equipped with a bright 2,000-nit OLED display and an array of upgraded health sensors, along with offline maps and a slick strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest. It even supports its own AI assistant, Zepp Flow, which is wild for a watch that retails for less than $100.

The Backbone might be the most flexible mobile controller out there. The USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad via Bluetooth.

Sonido Cosmico is a vibe. The latest LP from Hermanos Gutiérrez brims with lush instrumental guitar and a range of otherwordly influences, including Latin percussion, warm strings, and just the right amount of psychedelia. None of that should come as a suprise, though, given the duo recently opened for the likes of The Black Keys and Khruangbin.

Most of us at The Verge are hooked on coffee, and the winter months are a terrible time to be surprised by a cold cup of the black stuff. Thankfully, Ember’s ceramic Smart Mug keeps your beverage heated to your preferred temperature for up to 80 minutes (or indefinitely when it’s resting on the included charging coaster).

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

The Fanttik X8 Apex is the kind of gift that keeps on giving, even if you’d prefer to never use it. The compact tire inflator features a built-in LCD display and can deliver up to 150psi, allowing your giftee to quickly top off their car or road bike with the right amount of air. It even functions as a power bank and charges via USB-C, just to make things easy.

The Notes app in iOS is great, but sometimes pen and paper are where it’s at. Field Notes are small enough to fit in your pocket or a small bag, yet spacious enough to house all your big ideas and errant thoughts. The “1943” Edition — the company’s first with two staples on the short side — can even add a much-needed pop of color to any desk setup.</div>

If you like how well AirPods work with iPhones but want something more colorful and flexible, the Beats Studio Buds Plus are a nice middle ground. They’re platform-agnostic and are on sale for $99.95 ($70 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart for Presidents Day. The deal includes the eye-catching translucent option and is just $10 shy of the buds’ best price to date.

Unlike Apple’s AirPods, the Beats Studio Buds Plus play well with both iOS and Android devices, which is why they’re among our favorite wireless earbuds. You don’t get every ecosystem perk, but you do get a lot of the essentials. Apple iPhone owners, for example, get hands-free Siri, Find My support, one-step pairing, and Control Center integration. You miss out on AirPods-exclusive features like automatic device switching and spatial audio head-tracking, but in exchange, Android users get native support for Google’s Find Hub platform, Fast Pair, and audio switching.

Aside from software perks, the Beats Studio Buds Plus also sound excellent and deliver good noise cancellation that works well, even if not as impressively as the AirPods Pro. The tiny wireless earbuds are also among the most comfortable you can buy. Beats includes four swappable ear tips for a more secure fit. It’s a shame they lack wireless charging, but they can last up to 9 hours on a single charge, with up to 27 hours total with the case. Plus, they offer IPX4 water resistance, so they can handle sweat and light rain.

﻿Valve is also adding an option to collect anonymized framerate data for monitoring game compatibility.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

User reviews on Steam may get more informative after a Steam Client Beta update released on Thursday, which adds an option for users to attach their hardware specs to game reviews. Steam users have always been able to share their specs in the text of their reviews, but the option to automatically include that data could encourage more users to add it, potentially making reviews more useful.

When a user posts a negative review or reports having performance issues, the attached hardware specs could reveal why, highlighting when performance issues might be caused by a player’s hardware rather than a problem with the game itself (such as specs that are below a game’s recommended minimum). The option appears as a checkbox beside the text window where users write their reviews, so users who prefer not to share their hardware data can simply leave the box unchecked.

Thursday’s beta update also includes an option for users to share anonymized framerate data with Valve. The update notes state that this data will be “stored without connection to your Steam account” and will be used to monitor game compatibility and to improve Steam. However, right now this option is currently focused “on devices running SteamOS,” Valve’s Linux-based operating system that runs on the Steam Deck.

We’re rounding up the biggest discounts on earbuds, speakers, TVs, smart home tech, and other gadgets ahead of the holiday.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Deals have been admittedly pretty dry since the holidays, but now that February is in full swing, we’re starting to see strong discounts return across a range of categories. In fact, thanks to Valentine’s Day, the Super Bowl, and — as of this week — Presidents Day, retailers are once again offering a slew of notable tech deals, making now a great time to shop if you’ve been holding off on making a larger purchase.

Although the Super Bowl has technically come and gone, plenty of game-day discounts are still around. A few have been rebranded for Presidents Day — including the discounts we recently saw on Sonos soundbars and speakers — but others are part of a new wave of limited-time deals, letting you save on OLED TVs, wireless earbuds, iPads, and other gadgets through the end of Monday, February 16th.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best Presidents Day deals we’ve seen so far. As in previous years, we’ll continue updating this list with new picks throughout the long weekend and ensuing holiday.

Sony’s latest pair of flagship headphones feature improved comfort, better noise cancellation, and the ability to charge while in use. They even fold down for travel, which can’t be said about the last-gen XM5. Read our initial impressions.

The OpenFit Air feature a lightweight, open-ear design that allows you to remain aware of your surroundings. They’re well-suited for everyday use and the gym thanks to their IP55 water resistance rating, and feature relatively clear sound and a decent amount of bass despite their open build. Read our review.

The latest Beats Studio Pro feature improved noise cancellation, sound quality, and comfort. They also support lossless audio over USB-C, making them the first Apple headphones to do so. Read our review.

The OpenRun Pro 2 are Shokz’s best bone conduction headphones yet, with better sound and more bass than their predecessor. Our reviewer Victoria Song praised their cozy fit as well as their USB-C charging (goodbye, proprietary charger!). Read our review.

The Beats Studio Buds Plus sport an eye-catching translucent option and build upon the original with improved sound, better voice quality, and more effective ANC. They also include swappable silicon ear tips and support for native iOS and Android features. Read our review.

Nothing’s first pair of over-ear headphones feature a retro transparent design and high-end features like active noise cancellation, spatial audio with head tracking, and plush ear pads. They also feature a paddle button that allows you to control music playback. Read our review.

Sonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter.

The JBL Authentics 200 is one of the first smart speakers with simultaneous Google Assistant and Alexa support. The small, ‘70s-style speaker produces great sound for its size, and you don’t need to toggle a setting to use your preferred virtual assistant.

The latest version of Amazon’s zippy Fire TV Stick 4K streams in 4K resolution, as its name suggests, and features support for Wi-Fi 6, Dolby Atmos / Vision, and HDR10 Plus.

LG’s budget B5 is a great way to get OLED picture quality for less. It features support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports for hooking up the latest gaming consoles. It also runs LG’s webOS platform, supports Amazon Alexa, and provides easy access to a wide range of popular streaming apps.

LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features, including a max 144Hz refresh rate.

The Sonos Beam (second-gen) is a compact soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and can stream music from a plethora of services. Read our review.

The Bravia 8 II was chosen as the “king of TV” by a panel of judges (including The Verge’s own Nilay Patel) in Value Electronics’ 2025 shootout. The OLED TV has excellent color accuracy, a bright panel, and a 120Hz refresh rate.

Although the Apple Watch Series 11 is the same size as its predecessor, it features a 5G cellular modem, a display that Apple claims is twice as durable, and slightly improved battery life. Read our review.

The Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review.

The rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers a large, bright display along with long battery life and excellent performance. It sports Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s newer double tap feature. Read our review.

The Echo Dot Max features a flat design and a redesigned sound system, which delivers nearly three times the bass as its predecessor. It also offers improved conversation detection and better noise filtering, thanks to Amazon’s new AZ3 chip. Read our review.

The Aura Aspen digital frame lets you upload photos from anywhere using an accompanying companion app, various cloud services, or email. Its 12-inch LCD display features slim bezels, a 4:3 aspect ratio, and an anti-glare screen designed to mimic the look of real photos.

            <h2>What’s behind the mass exodus at xAI?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/878761/mass-exodus-at-xai-grok-elon-musk-restructuring">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Former employees say the restructuring followed tensions over safety and being “stuck in the catch-up phase.”

Former employees say the restructuring followed tensions over safety and being “stuck in the catch-up phase.”

The past few days have been a wild ride for xAI, which is racking up staff and cofounder departure announcements left and right. On Tuesday and Wednesday, cofounder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced his departure and that it was “time for [his] next chapter,” with cofounder Jimmy Ba following with a similar post later that day, writing that it was “time to recalibrate [his] gradient on the big picture.” The departures mean that xAI is now left with only half of its original 12 cofounders on staff. A number of staffers also took to X to announce they were leaving xAI, with some announcing that they were starting their own AI companies.

Elon Musk’s AI startup, by one merger / acquisition or another, is under the same umbrella as both his space company, SpaceX, and his social media platform, X. Since the SpaceX merger was announced last week, rumors have swirled about the reported $1.25 trillion valuation and the all-in-one company’s future plans, which Musk announced would involve “space-based AI” data centers and “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth.” In an internal meeting at xAI on Tuesday, Musk reportedly talked of plans to build an AI satellite factory and city on the Moon.

There’s often a natural departure point for companies post-merger, and Musk has announced that some of the departures were a reorganization that “unfortunately required parting ways with some people.” But there are also signs that people don’t like the direction Musk has taken things.

One source who spoke with The Verge about the happenings inside the company, who left earlier this year and requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation, said that many people at the company were disillusioned by xAI’s focus on NSFW Grok creations and disregard for safety. The source also felt like the company was “stuck in the catch-up phase” and not doing anything new or fundamentally different from its competitors. “Although we were iterating really fast, we were never able to get to a point like, ‘Oh, we’ve made a step function change over what OpenAI or Anthropic or other companies had released,’” he said.

The SpaceX merger meant that xAI shareholders were reportedly issued $250 billion in new shares, so employees with equity ostensibly have more runway to fund their own ideas. One former employee, Vahid Kazemi, wrote on X that “all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring. I think there’s room for more creativity. So, I’m starting something new.” Another former staffer said he left the company to “build something new, focused on accelerating science.”

Yet another former employee said he was launching an AI infrastructure company called Nuraline alongside other ex-xAI employees. He wrote, “During my time at xAI, I got to see a clear path towards hill climbing any problem that can be defined in a measurable way. At the same time, I’ve seen how raw intelligence can get lobotomized by the finest human errors … Learning shouldn’t stop at the model weights, but continue to improve every part of an AI system.”

Musk posted a recording of xAI’s 45-minute internal all-hands meeting that announced the changes, adding that xAI will be categorized into four main areas: Grok Main and Voice (the main Grok AI model), Coding, Imagine (image and video), and Macrohard (“which is intended to do full digital emulation of entire companies,” Musk said).

The source who departed earlier this year said Grok’s turn toward NSFW content was due partly to the safety team being let go, with little to no remaining safety review process for the models besides basic filters for things like CSAM. “Safety is a dead org at xAI,” he said. Looking at the restructured org chart Elon Musk shared on X, there’s no mention of a safety team. The source also said that during his time at xAI, he felt leadership had a lot of differing opinions on which product features to prioritize and that infighting sometimes stalled progress. A lot of decisions on what to ship happen via an all-company group chat on X with Musk in it, he said.

A second source, who departed xAI before the recent restructuring and requested anonymity, echoed the thoughts that Musk’s company was playing catch-up. “Trying to do what OpenAI was doing a year ago is not how you beat OpenAI,” he said. “Everything is a catch-up. There’s almost zero risky bet. If something hasn’t been done before we’re not going to do it.”

He mentioned xAI’s lack of safety focus too, an issue that was also highlighted in reporting by The Washington Post earlier this month.

“There is zero safety whatsoever in the company — not in the image [model], not in the chatbot,” the second source said. “He [Musk] actively is trying to make the model more unhinged because safety means censorship, in a sense, to him.”

The second source also said engineers at xAI immediately “push to prod[uction]” and that for a long time, there was no human review involved.

“You survive by shutting up and doing what Elon wants,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O’Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services.

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. And we need to be ready for what comes next. Read the full story.—Rhiannon Williams

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

This is part of our What’s Next series, which looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect. But they represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases. Read the full story. —Jessica Hamzelou

            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, M&A advisors such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

L40 is an M&A advisory firm specializing in tech deals that work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.
