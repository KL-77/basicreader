            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For close to a century, geoscientists have pondered a mystery: Where did Earth’s lighter elements go? Compared to amounts in the Sun and in some meteorites, Earth has less hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, as well as noble gases like helium—in some cases, more than 99 percent less.

Some of the disparity is explained by losses to the solar system as our planet formed. But researchers have long suspected that something else was going on too.

Recently, a team of scientists reported a possible explanation—that the elements are hiding deep in the solid inner core of Earth. At its super-high pressure—360 gigapascals, 3.6 million times atmospheric pressure—the iron there behaves strangely, becoming an electride: a little-known form of the metal that can suck up lighter elements.

Study coauthor Duck Young Kim, a solid-state physicist at the Center for High Pressure Science & Technology Advanced Research in Shanghai, says the absorption of these light elements may have happened gradually over a couple of billion years—and may still be going on today. It would explain why the movement of seismic waves traveling through Earth suggests an inner core density that is 5 percent to 8 percent lower than expected were it metal alone.

Electrides, in more ways than one, are having their moment. Not only might they help solve a planetary mystery, they can now be made at room temperature and pressure from an array of elements. And since all electrides contain a source of reactive electrons that are easily donated to other molecules, they make ideal catalysts and other sorts of agents that help to propel challenging reactions.

One electride is already in use to catalyze the production of ammonia, a key component of fertilizer; its Japanese developers claim the process uses 20 percent less energy than traditional ammonia manufacture. Chemists, meanwhile, are discovering new electrides that could lead to cheaper and greener methods of producing pharmaceuticals.

Today’s challenge is to find more of these intriguing materials and to understand the chemical rules that govern when they form.

Most solids are made from ordered lattices of atoms, but electrides are different. Their lattices have little pockets where electrons sit on their own.

Normal metals have electrons that are not stuck to one atom. These are the outer, or valence, electrons that are free to move between atoms, forming what is often referred to as a delocalized “sea of electrons.” It explains why metals conduct electricity.

The outer electrons of electrides no longer orbit a particular atom either, but they can’t freely move. Instead, they become trapped at sites between atoms that are called non-nuclear attractors. This gives the materials unique properties. In the case of the iron in Earth’s core, the negative electron charges stabilize lighter elements at non-nuclear attractors that were formed at those super-high pressures, 3,000 times that at the bottom of the deepest ocean. The elements would diffuse into the metal, explaining where they disappeared to.

The first metal found to form an electride at high pressure was sodium, reported in 2009. At a pressure of 200 gigapascals (2 million times greater than atmospheric pressure) it transforms from a shiny, reflective, conducting metal into a transparent glassy, insulating material. This finding was “very weird,” says Stefano Racioppi, a computational and theoretical chemist at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, who worked on sodium electrides while in the lab of Eva Zurek at the University at Buffalo in New York state. Early theories, he says, had predicted that at high pressure, sodium’s outer electrons would move even more freely between atoms.

The first sign that things were different came from predictions in the late 1990s, when scientists were using computational simulations to model solids, based on the rules of quantum theory. These rules define the energy levels that electrons can have, and hence the probable range of positions in which they are found in atoms (their atomic orbitals).

Simulating solid sodium showed that at high pressures, as the sodium atoms get squeezed closer together, so do the electrons orbiting each atom. That causes them to experience increasing repulsive forces with one another. This changes the relative energies of every electron orbiting the nucleus of each atom, Racioppi explains—leading to a reorganization of electron positions.

The result? Rather than occupying orbitals that allow them to be delocalized and move between atoms, the orbitals take on a new shape that forces electrons into the non-nuclear attractor sites. Since the electrons are stuck at these sites, the solid loses its metallic properties.

Adding to this theoretical work, Racioppi and Zurek collaborated with researchers at the University of Edinburgh to find experimental evidence for a sodium electride at extreme pressures. Squeezing crystals of sodium between two diamonds, they used X-ray diffraction to map electron density in the metal structure. This, they reported in September 2025, confirmed that electrons really were located in the predicted non-nuclear attractor sites between sodium atoms.

Electrides are ideal candidates for catalysts—substances that can speed up and lower the energy needed for chemical reactions. That’s because the isolated electrons at the non-nuclear attractor sites can be donated to make and break bonds. But to be useful, they would need to function at ambient conditions.

Several such stable electrides have been discovered over the last 10 years, made from inorganic compounds or organic molecules containing metal atoms. One of the most significant, mayenite, was found by surprise in 2003 when material scientist Hideo Hosono at the Institute of Science Tokyo was investigating a type of cement.

Mayenite is a calcium aluminate oxide that forms crystals with very small pores—a few nanometers across—called cages, that contain oxygen ions. If a metal vapor of calcium or titanium is passed over it at high temperature, it removes the oxygen, leaving behind just electrons trapped at these sites—an electride.

Unlike the high-pressure metal electrides that switch from conductors to insulators, mayenite starts as an insulator. But now its trapped electrons can jump between cage sites (via a process called quantum tunnelling)—making it a conductor, albeit 100 to 1,000 times less conductive than a metal like aluminum or silver. It also becomes an excellent catalyst, able to surrender electrons to help make and break bonds in reactions.

By 2011, Hosono had begun to develop mayenite as a greener and more efficient catalyst for synthesizing ammonia. Over 170 million metric tons of ammonia, mostly for fertilizers, is produced annually via the Haber-Bosch process, in which metal oxides facilitate hydrogen and nitrogen gases reacting together at high pressure and temperature. It is an energy-intensive, expensive process—Haber-Bosch plants account for some 2 percent of the world’s energy use.

In Haber-Bosch, the catalysts bind the two gases to their surfaces and donate electrons to help break the strong triple bond that holds the two nitrogen atoms together in nitrogen gas, as well as the bonds in hydrogen gas. Because mayenite has a strong electron-donating nature, Hosono thought mayenite would be able to do it better.

In Hosono’s reaction, mayenite itself does not bind the gases but acts as a support bed for nanoparticles of a metal called ruthenium. First, the nanoparticles absorb the nitrogen and hydrogen gases. Then the mayenite donates electrons to the ruthenium. These electrons flow into the nitrogen and hydrogen molecules, making it easier to break their bonds. Ammonia thus forms at a lower temperature—300 to 400° C—and lower pressure—50 to 80 atmospheres— than with Haber-Bosch, which takes place at 400 to 500° C and 100 to 400 atmospheres.

In 2017, the company Tsubame BHB was formed to commercialize Hosono’s catalyst, with the first pilot plant opening in 2019, producing 20 metric tons of ammonia per year. The company has since opened a larger facility in Japan and is setting up a 20,000-ton-per year green ammonia plant in Brazil to replace some of the nation’s fossil-fuel-based fertilizer production. The company estimates that this will avoid 11,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually—about equal to the annual emissions of 2,400 cars.

There are other applications for a mayenite catalyst, says Hosono, including a lower-energy conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals like methane, methanol or longer-chain hydrocarbons. Other scientists have suggested that mayenite’s cage structure also makes it suitable for immobilizing radioactive isotope waste in nuclear power stations: The electrons could capture negative ions like iodine and bromide and trap them in the cages.

Mayenite has even been studied as a low-temperature propulsion system for satellites in space. When it is heated to 600° C in a vacuum, its trapped electrons blast from the cages, causing propulsion.

The list of materials known to form electrides keeps growing. In 2024, a team led by chemist Fabrizio Ortu at the University of Leicester in the UK accidentally discovered another room-temperature-stable electride made from calcium ions surrounded by large organic molecules, together known as a coordination complex.

He was using a method known as mechanical chemistry—“You put something in a milling jar, you shake it really hard, and that provides the energy for the reaction,” he says. But to his surprise, electrons from the potassium he had added to his calcium complex were not donated to the calcium ion. Instead, what formed “had these electrons that were floating in the system,” he says, trapped in sites between the two metals.

Unlike mayenite, this electride is not a conductor—its trapped electrons do not jump. But they allow it to facilitate reactions that are otherwise hard to get started, by activating unreactive bonds, doing a job much like a catalyst. These are reactions that currently rely on expensive palladium catalysts.

The scientists successfully used the electride on a reaction that joins two pyridine rings—carbon rings containing a nitrogen atom. They are now examining whether the electride could assist in other common organic reactions, such as substituting a hydrogen atom on a benzene ring. These substitutions are difficult because the bond between the benzene ring carbon and its attached hydrogen is very stable.

There are still problems to sort out: Ortu’s calcium electride is too air- and water-sensitive for use in industry. He is now looking for a more stable alternative, which could prove particularly useful in the pharmaceutical industry to synthesize drug molecules, where the sorts of reactions Ortu has demonstrated are common.

There remain many unresolved mysteries about electrides, including whether Earth’s inner core definitely contains one. Kim and his collaborators used simulations of the iron lattice to find evidence for non-nuclear attractor sites, but their interpretation of the results remains “a little bit controversial,” Racioppi says.

Sodium and other metals in Group 1 and Group 2 of the periodic table of elements—such as lithium, calcium, and magnesium—have loosely bound outer electrons. This helps make it easy for electrons to shift to non-nuclear attractor sites, forming electrides. But iron exerts more pulling power on its outer electrons, which sit in differently shaped orbitals. This makes the increase in electron repulsion under pressure less significant and thus the shift to electride formation difficult, Racioppi says.

Electrides are still little known and little studied, says computational materials scientist Lee Burton of Tel Aviv University. There is still no theory or model to predict when a material will become one. “Because electrides are not typical chemically, you can’t bring your chemical intuition to it,” he says.

Burton has been searching for rules that might help with predictions and has had some success finding electrides from a screen of 40,000 known materials. He is now using artificial intelligence to find more. “It’s a complex interplay between different properties that sometimes can all depend on each other,” he says. “This is where machine learning can really help.”

The key is having reliable data to train any model. Burton’s team only has actual data from the handful of electride structures experimentally confirmed so far, but they also are using the kind of modeling based on quantum theory that was carried out by Racioppi to create high-resolution simulations of electron density within materials. They are doing this for as many materials as they can; those that are confirmed by real-world experiments will be used to train an AI model to identify more materials that are likely to be electrides—ones with the discrete pockets of high electron density characteristic of trapped electron sites. “The potential,” says Burton, “is enormous.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A company that seeks to disrupt the way in which data from space is received and transmitted has found some key investors and customers.

On Tuesday morning Northwood Space announced that it has closed a $100 million Series B round of funding to support a rapid ramp-up in the deployment of its phased-array radar system, known as Portal. The company also said it has received a $49.8 million contract from the US Space Force to augment the Satellite Control Network, which provides telemetry and tracking for the military’s satellites.

“We made our last fundraise announcement in April of 2025, so less than a year, but there’s been a lot of activity and progress on the Northwood side that reflects the importance of ground as an enabler for pushing forward more capable missions on shorter timelines,” said Bridgit Mendler, co-founder and CEO of Northwood, during a media roundtable. “That’s why we’re here, that’s why we’re building what we’re building, is because we believe that there’s a lot of important capability in space that needs to be built faster, and the way to do that is through a vertically integrated ground network.”

The funding announcements cap a busy year for Northwood, which emerged from stealth as a small startup in February 2024. The company was founded on the premise that there is a bottleneck in the capability of commercial ground stations to download increasing amounts of data gathered by satellites in orbit, and that this will only get worse. Northwood and its investors are betting that the existing network of commercial ground stations, many of which were deployed a decade or longer ago, cannot keep up with the pace of new satellites arriving in orbit.

In June the company demonstrated its second-generation phased-array antenna, known as Portal. Instead of needing to point directly at their target to collect a signal, like a parabolic dish antenna, phased-array antennas produce a beam of radio waves that can “point” in different directions without moving the antenna. It can also communicate with multiple satellites, in multiple orbits, at a single time.

By the end of the year, Northwood, based in El Segundo, California, had shown the ability to build eight of these Portal arrays a month. And in January the company had deployed operational Portal antennas across two continents. These deployments, which comprise an area of 8 to 15 meters, have the equivalent capability of a 7-meter parabolic dish, said Griffin Cleverly, co-founder and chief technical officer of Northwood.

“Across our initial Portal sites, it will be a few dozen spacecraft that each of them can handle,” he said. “And then, as we get into 2027, with much more scale manufacturing, we’ll easily be able to handle hundreds of satellites with our network.”

Northwood’s entry into the development of ground stations—there are about half a dozen major players in the industry, some long-established others new—came as the Space Force was looking to modernize its Satellite Control Network.

According to a government report published in 2023, the network makes 450 daily contacts with satellites and supports the launch and operations of these vehicles. The report found that the network faced “sustainment and obsolescence issues while demands on the system are increasing.”

The Space Force is seeking to address these issues as well as the proliferation of satellites in low-Earth orbit, and came to Northwood looking to scale up its system to meet these needs. Northwood began working with the Space Force in September.

The company seeks to address both government and commercial customers with the Portal system and future antennas. One growth area much discussed in recent months has been orbital data centers, which would necessitate the movement of huge amounts of data to and from space. Mendler said Northwood was “enthusiastic” to support such initiatives.

“Our overall perspective on the space industry was that volume of data was going to go up, use cases were going to go up,” Mendler said of the reasons for founding Northwood.

“And that has definitely borne out, whether we’re talking about communications, which has also been surging, or manufacturing or energy or compute, all of these different use cases in space, there’s a lot of appetite to address them,” she added. “The way that we think about ourselves is someone who conceives of solutions for how to make that all happen and then is accountable to actually see them through.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, OpenAI engineer Michael Bolin published a detailed technical breakdown of how the company’s Codex CLI coding agent works internally, offering developers insight into AI coding tools that can write code, run tests, and fix bugs with human supervision. It complements our article in December on how AI agents work by filling in technical details on how OpenAI implements its “agentic loop.”

AI coding agents are having something of a “ChatGPT moment,” where Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and Codex with GPT-5.2 have reached a new level of usefulness for rapidly coding up prototypes, interfaces, and churning out boilerplate code. The timing of OpenAI’s post details the design philosophy behind Codex just as AI agents are becoming more practical tools for everyday work.

These tools aren’t perfect and remain controversial for some software developers. While OpenAI has previously told Ars Technica that it uses Codex as a coding tool to help develop the Codex product itself, we also discovered, through hands-on experience, that these tools can be astonishingly fast at simple tasks but remain brittle beyond their training data and require human oversight for production work. The rough framework of a project tends to come fast and feels magical, but filling in the details involves tedious debugging and workarounds for limitations the agent cannot overcome on its own.

Bolin’s post doesn’t shy away from these engineering challenges. He discusses the inefficiency of quadratic prompt growth, performance issues caused by cache misses, and bugs the team discovered (like MCP tools being enumerated inconsistently) that they had to fix.

The level of technical detail is somewhat unusual for OpenAI, which has not published similar breakdowns of how other products like ChatGPT work internally, for example (there’s a lot going on under that hood we’d like to know). But we’ve already seen how OpenAI treats Codex differently during our interview with them in December, noting that programming tasks seem ideally suited for large language models.

It’s worth noting that both OpenAI and Anthropic open-source their coding CLI clients on GitHub, allowing developers to examine the implementation directly, whereas they don’t do the same for ChatGPT or the Claude web interface.

Bolin’s post focuses on what he calls “the agent loop,” which is the core logic that orchestrates interactions between the user, the AI model, and the software tools the model invokes to perform coding work.

As we wrote in December, at the center of every AI agent is a repeating cycle. The agent takes input from the user and prepares a textual prompt for the model. The model then generates a response, which either produces a final answer for the user or requests a tool call (such as running a shell command or reading a file). If the model requests a tool call, the agent executes it, appends the output to the original prompt, and queries the model again. This process repeats until the model stops requesting tools and instead produces an assistant message for the user.

That looping process has to start somewhere, and Bolin’s post reveals how Codex constructs the initial prompt sent to OpenAI’s Responses API, which handles model inference. The prompt is built from several components, each with an assigned role that determines its priority: system, developer, user, or assistant.

The instructions field comes from either a user-specified configuration file or base instructions bundled with the CLI. The tools field defines what functions the model can call, including shell commands, planning tools, web search capabilities, and any custom tools provided through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The input field contains a series of items that describe the sandbox permissions, optional developer instructions, environment context like the current working directory, and finally the user’s actual message.

As conversations continue, each new turn includes the complete history of previous messages and tool calls. This means the prompt grows with every interaction, which has performance implications. According to the post, because Codex does not use an optional “previous_response_id” parameter that would allow the API to reference stored conversation state, every request is fully stateless (that is, it sends the entire conversation history with each API call rather than the server retrieving it from memory). Bolin says this design choice simplifies things for API providers and makes it easier to support customers who opt in to “Zero Data Retention,” where OpenAI does not store user data.

The quadratic growth of prompts over a conversation is inefficient, but Bolin explains that prompt caching mitigates this issue somewhat. Cache hits only work for exact prefix matches within a prompt, which means Codex must carefully avoid operations that could cause cache misses. Changing the available tools, switching models, or modifying the sandbox configuration mid-conversation can all invalidate the cache and hurt performance.

The ever-growing prompt length is directly related to the context window, which limits how much text the AI model can process in a single inference call. Bolin writes that Codex automatically compacts conversations when token counts exceed a threshold, just as Claude Code does. Earlier versions of Codex required manual compaction via a slash command, but the current system uses a specialized API endpoint that compresses context while preserving summarized portions of the model’s “understanding” of what happened through an encrypted content item.

Bolin says that future posts in his series will cover the CLI’s architecture, tool implementation details, and Codex’s sandboxing model.</div>

            <h2>Doctors face-palm as RFK Jr.’s top vaccine advisor questions need for polio shot</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/do-we-really-need-polio-shots-deep-thoughts-by-rfk-jr-advisor-get-dragged/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The chair of a federal vaccine advisory panel under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made his stance clear on vaccines in a podcast last week—and that stance was so alarming that the American Medical Association was compelled to respond with a scathing statement.

Kirk Milhoan, who was named chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in December, appeared on the aptly named podcast “Why Should I Trust You.” In the hour-long interview, Milhoan made a wide range of comments that have concerned medical experts and raised eyebrows.

Early into the discussion, Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist, declared, “I don’t like established science,” and that “science is what I observe.” He lambasted the evidence-based methodology that previous ACIP panels used to carefully and transparently craft vaccine policy.

While arguing that he was not anti-vaccine, he said he was merely focused on safety and made false claims about vaccine risks, a common trope among anti-vaccine activists. He falsely linked vaccines to allergies, asthma, and eczema and repeated a claim, without evidence, that COVID-19 vaccines killed children. When pressed by the podcast hosts, he revealed that he put the risk of vaccine side effects on the same footing as the risks from the diseases the shots prevent—despite the fact that disease risks are often orders of magnitude larger than the tiny risks from vaccines.

In response to pushback from the hosts, Milhoan objected to the idea that the measles and polio vaccines reduced the spread of those diseases. He went further, questioning the need for those vaccines as well as routine vaccinations, generally.

“I think also as you look at polio, we need to not be afraid to consider that we are in a different time now than we were then,” he said, referring to the time before the first polio vaccines were developed in the 1950s. “Our sanitation is different. Our risk of disease is different. And so those all play into the evaluation of whether this is worthwhile of taking a risk for a vaccine or not.”

He then pondered out loud what would happen if people stopped getting vaccinated. “If we take away all of the herd immunity, then does that switch, does that teeter-totter switch in a different direction?” he asked.

In a statement, AMA Trustee Sandra Adamson Fryhofer blasted the question. “This is not a theoretical debate—it is a dangerous step backward,” she said. “Vaccines have saved millions of lives and virtually eliminated devastating diseases like polio in the United States. There is no cure for polio. When vaccination rates fall, paralysis, lifelong disability, and death return. The science on this is settled.”

Fryhofer also took aim at Milhoan’s repeated argument that the focus of vaccination policy should move from population-level health to individual autonomy. Moving away from routine immunizations, which include discussions between clinicians and patients, “does not increase freedom—it increases suffering,” she said, adding that the weakening of recommendations “will cost lives.”

Overall, Milhoan’s comments only further erode the relevance of ACIP and federal vaccine policy among the medical community and states. According to a KFF policy brief, 27 states and Washington, DC, have already announced they will not follow current CDC vaccine recommendations, which Kennedy dramatically overhauled earlier this month without even consulting the ACIP. Instead, the majority of states are relying on previous recommendations or recommendations made within states or by medical organizations.

On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced the 2026 update to its childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule, which it has held up as an alternative to the CDC’s schedule and has been widely embraced by pediatricians. In the announcement, AAP noted that 12 other medical organizations have endorsed the schedule, including the AMA, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.

The AAP’s updated recommendations are largely the same as the schedule from last year, but it is significantly different from the CDC’s recommendations, which “depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,” the AAP said.

“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,” AAP President Andrew Racine said in the announcement.</div>

            <h2>Why has Microsoft been routing example.com traffic to a company in Japan?</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/odd-anomaly-caused-microsofts-network-to-mishandle-example-com-traffic/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Department of Bizarre Anomalies: Microsoft has suppressed an unexplained anomaly on its network that was routing traffic destined to example.com—a domain reserved for testing purposes—to a maker of electronics cables located in Japan.

Under the RFC2606—an official standard maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force—example.com isn’t obtainable by any party. Instead it resolves to IP addresses assigned to Internet Assiged Names Authority. The designation is intended to prevent third parties from being bombarded with traffic when developers, penetration testers, and others need a domain for testing or discussing technical issues. Instead of naming an Internet-routable domain, they are to choose example.com or two others, example.net and example.org.

Output from the terminal command cURL shows that devices inside Azure and other Microsoft networks have been routing some traffic to subdomains of sei.co.jp, a domain belonging to Sumitomo Electric. Most of the resulting text is exactly what’s expected. The exception is the JSON-based response. Here’s the JSON output from Friday:

Similarly, results when adding a new account for test@example.com in Outlook looked like this:

In both cases, the results show that Microsoft was routing email traffic to two sei.co.jp subdomains: imapgms.jnet.sei.co.jp and smtpgms.jnet.sei.co.jp. The behavior was the result of Microsoft’s autodiscover service.

“I’m admittedly not an expert in Microsoft’s internal workings, but this appears to be a simple misconfiguration,” Michael Taggart, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health, said. “The result is that anyone who tries to set up an Outlook account on an example.com domain might accidentally send test credentials to those sei.co.jp subdomains.”

When asked early Friday afternoon why Microsoft was doing this, a representative had no answer and asked for more time. By Monday morning, the improper routing was no longer occurring, but the representative still had no answer.

Update: in an email sent after this post went live, the representative confirmed that Microsoft has “updated the service to no longer provide suggested server information for example.com.” As already reported here, the behavior only affected people configuring email accounts through the Outlook autoconfiguration feature. The representative added that Microsoft is investigating.

The new JSON response suggested that, as of Monday morning, Microsoft hadn’t fixed the endpoint routing traffic to the Sumitomo Electric servers. Instead, the JSON response no longer occurs. Where the output was occurring on Friday, the command now simply sits and hangs for 10 or 20 seconds and then terminates with a not found error. This behavior can be seen in the following output:

“It looks like they may have outright removed the endpoint that validates the email, because I’m seeing ‘not found’ errors,” said Dan Tentler, founder of Phobos Group. As denoted by ENOTFOUND, the error “suggests that [Microsoft admins] just ripped out whatever this thing was.”

It’s unclear how Sumitomo Electric’s domain would have found itself part of this mess. Microsoft last year said the Japanese company’s parent company, Sumitomo Corp., was deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot, but that still doesn’t explain why a subsidiary’s domain was added to Microsoft’s network configuration.

Questions sent to Microsoft include: How are autodiscover records added at Microsoft; was the routing intentional; and how long has the behavior been occurring? (Tinyapps.org, which noted the odd routing behavior earlier this month, said it lasted five years.) There doesn’t appear to be anything nefarious about the improper routing, and as long as people inside Microsoft’s network weren’t sending live credentials in tests, there was no danger posed.

There’s still reason for concern. In 2024, Microsoft revealed that one of its admins had assigned administrative privileges to a test account on the company network and then forgot about it. Russia-state hackers seized on the gaffe to gain initial access to Microsoft’s system. They went on to root through the network and monitor top executives’ email for two months. The routing misconfiguration for example.com raises the question: What other possibly more severe errors lurk on the network?</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple is introducing a new version of its AirTag tracking device—simply dubbed “the new AirTag&quot;—and claims it offers substantial improvements thanks to a new Bluetooth chip.

The original AirTag came out five years ago now, and it became popular in a variety of contexts. There were some problems, though—there was real concern about unwanted tracking and stalking with the devices, based on real stories of it being used for that. The company gradually introduced new features and protections against that, getting it to a much better place.

This new version is focused on making the device more effective in general. Thanks to the inclusion of the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip (the same one found in other recently released Apple devices like the iPhone 17), Apple says the new AirTag can work with the Precision Finding feature in the Find My app to direct users to the AirTag (and whatever lost item it’s stored with or attached to) from up to 50 percent farther away.

Additionally, the speaker in the AirTag is now 50 percent louder, Apple says. These two things together address some user complaints that, as useful as an AirTag can be in ideal circumstances, sometimes it is frustrating trying to get things just right to find something. It won’t eliminate all edge cases, but it ought to help.

Apple used this announcement to also talk up some of the features of the AirTag, including the encryption that it says prevents anyone but the AirTag owner from using it, and an arrangement with airlines where users can temporarily give airlines the ability to use Apple’s network to find a specific AirTag to locate lost luggage and the like.

To be clear, the new AirTag doesn’t introduce any major new features that aren’t already offered in the previous generation—this is just an update to the device’s accuracy, volume, and range.

The price remains unchanged, at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a pack of four. The new model is available for order on Apple’s website now and will hit physical stores later this week.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk has long garnered a reputation for being massively wrong in his promises and predictions about the future.

In 2024, for instance, he said that AI would become “smarter than the smartest human” by 2025. He said his company’s SpaceX Starship rocket, which is still exploding during test flights, will land on Mars this year. Like clockwork, he’s predicted that self-driving cars will become a reality “next year” every year for well over a decade now. He promised robotaxis without human safety monitors by mid-2025, which the company still has yet to accomplish.

We could go on and on. In short, it’d be far easier to count the occasions on which he’s been right than when he’s been wrong.

Now, as NBC News reports, users on online prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket are making big bucks off of Musk’s astonishing track record for being wrong about the future. Case in point, Polymarket user David Bensoussan made a ten percent return after betting $10,000 that Musk wouldn’t follow through on his threat of forming a new political party following his falling out with president Donald Trump.

He also successfully bet against Musk’s prediction that Tesla would launch an “unsupervised” version of its erroneously-named “Full Self-Driving” software by the end of 2025.

To Bensoussan, it’s a matter of principle.

“He does have a solid fan base, and so if I can help separate them from some of their money, I’m always happy to do that,” he told NBC. “He has a habit of exaggerating timelines, and of saying he’s going to do these amazing things and attaching more immediacy than what his intent may necessarily be.”

It’s an ironic inversion of the ethos of many of Musk’s investors, who have long warned to never bet against the mercurial CEO.

In total, Bensoussan’s ploy to bet against Musk’s wildly optimistic predictions has paid off, garnering him over $36,000.

Online prediction markets have surged in popularity in recent years. While benefitting from a largely unfettered regulatory vacuum, sites like Polymarket and Kalshi have also become embroiled in major insider trading controversies. Case in point, earlier this year, an anonymous bettor netted a cool $410,000 after accurately predicting the Trump administration’s attacks on Venezuela mere hours before Trump issued orders authorizing the strikes.

Even Musk himself has frequently voiced his support for prediction markets. His AI company, xAI, has deep integrations of both Kalshi and Polymarket.

But as it turns out, actively betting against his many attempts to reassure investors that a major technological revolution is just around the corner — a gambit that has largely worked out for him in the past — could be pretty lucrative.

As for current predictions, the online platforms aren’t exactly eager to stand behind his latest prophecies. For instance, only 13 percent of Kalshi users believe Musk will make good on his recent threat to buy airline Ryanair by the end of this year. The airline’s CEO, Michael O’Leary, had questioned the economics of adding SpaceX Starlink internet to airliners, resulting in petty name-calling.

As NBC points out, Musk also tried to manipulate prediction markets by calling a bet on Polymarket that Tesla will launch a robotaxi service before July 2025 a “money-making opportunity.”

Markets expectedly rose, with odds tripling to about 40 percent.

However, as the rules stipulated, a robotaxi service would only count if it was open to the general public — something that only materialized well after July 2025 — leading to plenty of users getting “burned.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A doctor who witnessed the brutal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents says that the agents didn’t even bother trying to save the victim’s life as he bled out on the ground — because they were too busy counting the bullet wounds.

The harrowing testimony, detailed in a sworn court filing, contradicts key details in the accounts given by the Department of Homeland Security and top officials in the Trump administration, which insist that the 37-year-old ICU nurse threatened agents and attempted to reach for his gun during an altercation in Minneapolis on Saturday.

According to the witness, a 29-year-old physician who isn’t identified by name in the court document, Pretti was yelling at the agents but did not attack them or brandish any sort of weapon before the situation escalated fatally.

“Suddenly, an ICE agent shoved him to the ground,” the witness said, referring to the Border Patrol officers. “My view of the altercation was partially obstructed, but after a few seconds, I saw at least four ICE agents point guns at the man. I then saw the agents shoot the man at least six or seven times.”

When he rushed to the scene and told Border Patrol he was a physician and wanted to attend to the victim, the agents demanded to see his physician’s license — “which I obviously didn’t have,” he said.

Shockingly, he noticed that “none of the ICE agents who were near the victim were performing CPR” despite him clearly being in “critical condition,” so the doctor continued his protests.

“Normally, I would not have been so persistent, but as a physician, I felt a professional and moral obligation to help this man,” he said, “especially since none of the agents were helping him.”

Once the agents finally let him through, the first red flag that jumped out at him was that the victim was lying on his side.

“That is not standard practice when a victim has been shot. Checking for a pulse and administering CPR is standard practice,” he said. “Instead of doing either of those things, the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds.”

The doctor checked for a pulse, found that Pretti had none, and immediately began CPR. According to the physician, Pretti had at least three bullet wounds in his back, another on his upper left chest, and possibly one on his neck. The doctor left after EMS arrived at the scene and took charge.

He described how the scene had left him shaken afterwards.

“When I returned to my apartment, I was extremely distraught,” the doctor said. “I was sobbing and shaking uncontrollably.”

Soon, tear gas began to flood into his apartment from a protest outside, and he left to drive to a friend’s house, “still crying and shaking” and “barely able to speak.”

Pretti’s killing has added to the intense backlash against ICE and Border Patrol’s brutal crackdown in Minneapolis, where the federal agents have clashed with onlookers, rounded up both citizen and non-citizen children, and shot and killed another protestor, 37-year-old Renee Good.

Contradicting the mountains of video evidence taken at the scene, the DHS maintains that Pretti, a nurse that treated sick and wounded veterans at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Agency secretary Kristi Noem called his actions “domestic terrorism,” and White House Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller accused him of being an “assassin.”

“The victim was not actively threatening ICE agents or the public — he was just yelling at the agents because he objected to ICE’s presence in our city,” he said in the filing.

“I am not sure when I will return to my apartment,” he added. “I do not feel safe in my city.”

            <h2>Tesla Kills Autopilot After Storm of Criticism, Paywalls Basic Features</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/tesla-kills-autopilot-criticism">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The concept for Tesla’s driver-assistance system, Autopilot, has been around for well over a decade. Elon Musk’s EV maker has long used the term to describe features like advanced cruise control and auto-steer, all the while admitting that drivers still need to be able to take over at any time.

But in light of plummeting sales and shrinking profits, Tesla has killed the feature in the United States and Canada for good. It’s a major reversal after over a decade of Musk making yearly — and flat-out wrong — predictions of achieving fully autonomous, or Level 5, driving “next year.”

Autopilot has also been caught up in several high-profile investigations by federal regulators, following hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths involving the feature. The EV maker has also faced a litany of lawsuits over the software, including a $329 million wrongful death settlement last year.

To raise much-needed revenue now that car sales have taken a major hit, the company has instead paywalled most of the basic features. Starting on February 14, Tesla owners will need to shell out a steep $99 a month to enable features like autosteer or advanced lane keep assist, something the vehicles were previously capable of without a subscription. (Traffic Aware Cruise Control, however, will remain standard, even without a subscription.)

The timing is suspect, to say the least. As Ars Technica points out, a court ruled in December that Tesla deceived its customers by implying that its “Autopilot” branding amounts to “deceptive marketing,” giving the company a mere 60 days to fix any misleading claims or be banned from selling cars in California, one of its biggest markets.

The start of the subscription service almost perfectly aligns with that deadline, although it remains unclear what exactly motivated the company to kill Autopilot. Another major motivating factor may be Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to reach 10 million active subscriptions to its driver assistance software.

Tesla’s branding for the features has been especially confusing as of late, differentiating between Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), a highly controversial and easily fooled add-on package that also still requires the driver to stay engaged at all times, despite its misleading name.

As of February 14, owners will only be able to either pay $99 a month for an FSD subscription — or live with the fact that their vehicles’ driver assistance capabilities will be considerably reined in. Before that date, users can still shell out a steep $8,000 to permanently unlock FSD.

Musk has boasted that it’s an incredible value add — and one that’s going to become even more expensive as time goes on.

“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” Musk warned in a January 22 tweet. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”

When such an “unsupervised” version of FSD will materialize remains a mystery. However, given Musk’s track record of making predictions about the tech, such a future may still be many years out — if it ever materializes.

            <h2>Earth’s Lower Orbit Could Rapidly Collapse, Scientists Warn</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you thought humanity already had its hands full with climate change, think again.

With satellites and space junk increasingly cluttering our planet’s low Earth orbit, a team of scientists warn that this entire region could suddenly collapse into a destructive maelstrom of swirling debris, posing a threat to any spacecraft that dares to venture up there, and hurling dangerous missiles of space junk down onto our planet below.

Their study, which is yet-to-be-peer reviewed, builds on a theoretical scenario first laid out by NASA scientist Donald Kessler, which describes how just a few accidental collisions between satellites could quickly cascade into a vicious cycle in which the resulting debris causes even more smash-ups, and thus even more debris. At worst, the ensuing vortex of dangerous debris could trap us on our planet and set back spaceflight for decades.

With more satellites being launched into low Earth orbit than ever, this scenario — dubbed Kessler syndrome — is starting to be considered as a serious possibility. Elon Musk’s SpaceX alone maintains a “megaconstellation” of over 9,000 expendable satellites, with Amazon set to follow suit with its own megaconstellation and China working on yet another.

Kessler originally envisioned this orbital catastrophe unfolding over many years. But the new work adds a grim twist to the mix. What if a Kessler syndrome type scenario was suddenly kicked off by a violent solar storm? These outbursts by the Sun blast the Earth with electromagnetic waves that can disrupt electrical grids and communications. In theory, a powerful enough one could cut off our contact with satellites and fry their navigation systems, leaving them with no means to stay on course.

It’s a concerning possibility. With all that stuff up there, SpaceX’s expendable satellites have to constantly perform maneuvers to avoid hitting each other and other objects, with over 300,000 of these maneuvers performed last year.

Investigating this possibility, the researchers created a new metric called the CRASH clock, which measures how long it would take a catastrophic collision to occur if the satellites lose navigation in a crisis like a solar storm.

The gist is that things would go south very quickly. The researchers calculated that satellites may be having a “close approach,” or pass within one kilometer of each other, once every 36 seconds in low Earth orbit — an uncomfortably close distance in space.

Factoring that in, they put the CRASH clock at just 5.5 days, meaning that humanity would have very little time to intervene if this solar storm did occur. On the other hand, if we were struck by a solar event of this magnitude — like the infamous Carrington Event in 1859, which took out the planet’s burgeoning telegraph infrastructure and today would likely cause blackouts the world over— we would probably have more immediate concerns to worry about.

            <h2>Trump Forgets the Word for “Alzheimer’s” While Insisting His Memory Is Fine</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Experts have long questioned president Donald Trump’s claims of having a clean bill of health. He has been spotted with swollen ankles and dark bruises on both of his hands, which experts argue could be a sign that he’s receiving frequent intravenous treatments.

His mental acuity has also been called into question, with critics pointing to his slurred speech, nonsensical rants, and lapses in memory.

Case in point, in a recently published interview with New York Magazine, Trump struggled to recall the name of Alzheimer’s disease — a particularly dark blunder, considering the condition is characterized by progressive memory loss, and Trump has a family history of it.

When discussing his father, Fred Trump, he struggled to remember what the disease was called.

“He had one problem. At a certain age, about 86, 87, he started getting… what do they call it?” he pondered during the video.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt came to his rescue.

“Like an Alzheimer’s thing,” the president continued. “Well, I don’t have it.”

When asked if the disease is “something you think about at all,” Trump was vehement in his denial, but once again struggled to sound coherent.

“No, I don’t think about it at all,” he said. “You know why? Because whatever it is, my attitude is whatever.”

Swirling questions about Trump’s cognitive condition have clearly frustrated the 79-year-old. During baffling remarks from the Oval Office earlier this month, made after signing a bipartisan Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, Trump boasted that a penchant for dairy had allowed him to “ace” all of his cognitive tests.

“I’ve aced every one of them because I drink milk,” he said.

He also boasted about passing cognitive tests on January 2 and December 9, suggesting that his neurological condition has been evaluated frequently in recent months. (He’s discussed the topic for years now, claiming to have achieved a top score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a 30-point cognitive screening tool to detect cognitive impairment, back in 2018.)

Also concerning is his family history. Fred Trump died at the age of 93 in 1999, after struggling with the disease for almost a decade.

Adding to Trump’s optics conundrum around his health, his top staff often defends his physical and mental health in terms so strong that it can be unintentionally comical.

Leavitt, for instance, insisted to NY Mag that the “Marine sentries who stand outside the Oval Office, they had to request more staff and bring up more Marines because the president is in the Oval Office so much.”

“They’ve never had to do that before,” she said. “They had to request more guys to stand by the door because they are running out of men to fill the shifts.”

“He’s working harder now than he did in his entire life,” she told the magazine. “Even in real estate when he was on top of the world in New York.”

            <h2>Scientists Investigating 2,000-Year-Old Artifact That Appears to Be a Battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 2,000 year old battery, or just a very interesting pot?

This is the debate that’s been swirling over the fragments of a puzzling artifact discovered in Iraq nearly a century ago. Dubbed the “Baghdad battery,” it’s believed to have originally been a clay jar housing a copper vessel, at the center of which was an iron rod. This arrangement, either by coincidence or design, could’ve allowed it to function as a primitive galvanic cell, some archaeologists argue — a primitive energy storage device pioneered in the Western world by Alessandro Volta, after whom the “volt” was named.

These are tough claims to bear out, not least of all because the original artifact has been lost since the US’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. As such, archaeologists have had to rely on reconstructing the strange vessel based on records to try to tease out its origins.

Now a new study highlighted by Chemistry World purports that the Baghdad battery wasn’t just a battery, but one that was capable of outputting much more power than once believed.

“If this artefact were truly a battery — and I could be wrong of course — then my experiment shows the most effective and convenient way it could have been used as one,” the author, independent researcher Alexander Bazes, told the outlet.

Skeptics argue that the artifact, in its suspected arrangement, would’ve outputted too puny an amount of power to have intentionally been a battery.

Bazes’s reconstruction argues otherwise. His experiments suggests that the clay jar’s porous exterior acted like a separator between an electrolyte, perhaps lye, and air, which connected with the copper vessel to create an outer cell. Meanwhile, the iron rod inside the copper vessel acted as an inner cell, creating an electrical series that could’ve produced 1.4 volts of electricity — approximately the same voltage of a modern AA battery.

Still, Bazes doesn’t buy the argument purported by some fringe archaeologists that the battery’s copper vessel would’ve been used to electroplate jewelry, or coat them in a thin layer of metal. Instead, he argues the Baghdad battery may have been used to “ritually corrode” prayers written on paper, as witnessing the corrosion would’ve been seen as “visual evidence of an energetic influence having passed through their prayer,” Bazes wrote in the study.

Or maybe it wasn’t a battery at all, counters University of Pennsylvania archaeologist William Hafford, who has extensively researched the artifact. In reality, it was likely a sacred jar for storing prayers, he told Chemistry World, noting that other magic items like it have been found buried nearby, including a similar clay jar with ten copper vessels, which is obviously too many to form a battery. The iron rod that supposedly acted as an electrode for the inner battery cell were really just iron nails that were part of the magical ritual.

“You would drop the prayer through the neck of the jar, seal it with bitumen and then bury it with a ritual,” Hafford told the outlet. “They were usually buried in the ground because you were giving them to the chthonic deities.”

            <div id="article-text">Samsung announced on Tuesday that its Galaxy Z TriFold smartphone will go on sale January 30 with a steep price tag of $2,899. The phone’s display unfolds twice to reveal a 10-inch display, which is the largest screen ever on a Galaxy phone.

It measures 3.9 millimeters at its thinnest point and is engineered to withstand up to 200,000 folds over its lifetime. The phone will come in black with 512GB of storage in the U.S.

The phone carries a higher price tag than any other smartphone on the U.S. market, surpassing even a fully loaded iPhone 17 Pro Max with 2TB of storage and Samsung’s own $2,000 Galaxy Z Fold.

The Galaxy Z TriFold will be available throughout the U.S. at Samsung Experience Stores and Samsung.com. Notably, it won’t be available through mobile carriers.

The phone is the first foldable of its kind to be available in the U.S., as Huawei’s trifold Mate XT isn’t sold in the U.S. It’s worth noting that Apple is rumored to be releasing its first folding phone later this year.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/phoebe-gates-and-sophia-kiannis-phia-raises-35m-to-make-shopping-fun-again/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Phia’s team is locked in — literally. The startup is laser-focused on building an AI shopping agent, but also, after a snowstorm barreled through New York City, Phia founders Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni can’t leave their respective apartments. So it’s a rarity that when I chat with the former Stanford roommates and best friends, they are not together, nor are they in the Phia office.

“We were like, ‘It’s okay, stay home.’ It’s dangerous. Nobody needs to go to the office,” Kianni told TechCrunch, laughing. But while she and Gates hunkered down at home, many of their employees still made the trek to the office. “Our team is sending Slack photos right now… The entire porch is snow.”

Such is the life of a fast-growing startup. Phia is ten months old, yet it just closed a $35 million funding round led by Notable Capital with participation from Khosla Ventures and returning investor Kleiner Perkins.

It’s a quick turnaround. When I last spoke with Phia in October on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage, they were just one month removed from an $8 million round that included checks from celebrity investors like Kris Jenner, Sara Blakely, and Sheryl Sandberg. (Yes, Phoebe Gates is the daughter of Bill and Melinda; no, her parents are not bankrolling her startup.)

“We are just at such a prime time of opportunity,” Gates said to explain the new fundraise. “Commerce itself for the consumer hasn’t really been adapted in the last 30 years, and the opportunity to make a truly personalized, end-to-end shopping experience is today.”

With hundreds of thousands of monthly active users, Phia has achieved 11x revenue growth since launch and onboarded 6,200 retail partners.

As it stands, Phia is a mobile app and a web browser extension that seeks to help shoppers save money by showing them resale or second-hand alternatives to the products they’re looking for. If you’re about to buy a brand new Anthropologie dress for $200, for example, Phia could show you that the same dress is available on Poshmark for $80.

There’s a sustainability angle to buying second-hand – Kianni is a climate activist and former advisor to the United Nations – but as a tech company, the founders understand that their way to build a customer base is to simply help them save money. Beyond resale options, Phia might also recommend similar items from less expensive brands, which is where its partnerships come in.

“A lot of [brand partners] were very much taking a bet on us and joining the platform when we had less proof points,” said Kianni. When brands make sales on Phia, the app gets a cut, similar to an affiliate marketing model. “With new offerings that we have, we actually have data to be able to show things like, we can give them a 15% increase in average order value, or 30% stronger new customer acquisition, or 50% lower return rates.”

Much of Phia’s success stems from its founder-led marketing tactics. As Gen Z digital natives, Gates and Kianni have amassed over 2 million followers across social media platforms. This includes their podcast “The Burnouts,” in which the duo talk about their entrepreneurship journey and interview prominent figures in business and entertainment, from Bryan Johnson to Paris Hilton.

The Phia founders have ambitions to turn the app into what Gates calls a “holistic shopping agent,” which is why the company plans to use its newfound capital to recruit top machine learning engineers.

“Our number one goal was always bringing the top engineering talent specifically into our company, and being able to have capital that can really attract the best people,” Kianni said.

The current Phia team, who all work out of the New York office (so long as there’s not a massive snowstorm), is about twenty people, which is small for a company with somewhat nebulous ambitions to revolutionize commerce – but as Kianni puts it, “It’s not even about team size anymore. It’s just about the quality of the talent you’re attracting.”

To bring their ideas to fruition, they’re going to need that kind of talent.

“Gone are the days where you would go to a static HTML page that’s not personalized for you, your taste, your sizes, and what you already own that’s in your closet,” Gates said.

As the company grows, she wants people to “go to Phia first, really to start that shopping journey from the top of the funnel, both with your own personalized feed and outfit recommendations for you based on your current closet, or understanding what you might want to donate or sell.”

In order to create such personalized experiences, however, Phia needs to collect user data, which is tricky to accomplish in a secure manner that keeps users informed about how much they’re sharing.

As reported by Fortune in November, cybersecurity researchers found a feature in Phia’s browser extension that was able to capture the HTML code of the websites users visited while using the extension, essentially collecting data from their browser history. The company removed the feature once notified and said in a statement to Fortune that “the extension previously logged webpage content to understand if the site was a shopping destination,” and that Phia has “never in the past, or at present, stored this data.”

“We always are extremely transparent with users about the reasons why we are requesting certain permissions, and everything is displayed very clearly up front,” Kianni said. “In terms of the way that we’re building our tech and our back end, we’ve always made sure all data is aggregated, anonymous, and only used for the purpose of being able to help users find the best products as efficiently as possible.”

Hopefully, that incident is remembered as a growing pain for the startup, and not an indicator of problems to come – because Phia is right that online shopping could use a makeover.

“I think that’s where AI agents play a huge role,” Kianni said. “All this cumbersome, manual work really can become compressed and be able to get you to the shortest path possible to the perfect item.”

“We’re on the cusp of a completely new way of shopping,” Gates added. “We want to make the entire ecosystem just way more efficient and make shopping fun again.”

            <h2>Airtable gets into the AI agent game with Superagent</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/airtables-valuation-fell-by-7-million-its-founder-thinks-that-was-just-the-warm-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It might sound crazy to some, launching an entirely new product line while your flagship business has shed two-thirds of its paper value. But Howie Liu, the founder and CEO of Airtable, suggests it’s the sanest thing he could do.

The company that investors valued at $11.7 billion during the zero-interest-rate fervor of 2021 now trades on secondary markets at roughly $4 billion. But Airtable has raised $1.4 billion total, and Liu says the company still has half of that in the bank while “throwing off cash.” The valuation collapse affected investor returns and employee stock options, but didn’t undermine the business itself.

Liu’s response is to launch Superagent, an AI agent he suggests could eventually eclipse Airtable itself. It’s Airtable’s first standalone product in its 13-year history, and captures both where the company is headed and the reality of the current AI moment: every serious software player is racing to prove they can deliver on agents.

To understand what makes this move especially interesting, consider what Airtable is: a no-code platform that democratizes app-building. It’s essentially a supercharged database that lets anyone create custom software tailored to their workflows. The company now employs more than 700 people and serves over 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100. This isn’t a struggling startup but instead a mature business betting its future on a new architecture.

Superagent represents Liu’s bet on “multi-agent coordination”—a system where you ask a question and get not one AI assistant fumbling through sequential tasks, but a coordinating agent that deploys specialists working in parallel. “You’re not prompting an AI,” Liu explains. “You’re orchestrating a team.”

Here’s how it works: When you ask Superagent about expanding your athleisure brand into Europe (an example from Liu), the system first builds a research plan, identifying what needs investigation and surfacing dimensions you didn’t think to ask about. Then it deploys specialized agents in parallel – one investigating financials, another analyzing competitive positioning, another reviewing management and news. Finally, it synthesizes everything into a finished deliverable.

The output isn’t a wall of text. It’s an interactive market analysis with demographic breakdowns, competitive presence mapped visually, and expansion timelines you can filter and explore. “What if every person could have New York Times-quality data visualization built for every task they have,” Liu told me over Zoom last week. “This would have been unfathomable ten years ago, or five years ago, where you don’t get that quality of output – you just get text. But to be able to now get truly extremely high quality, rich interactive outputs as a default format, I think that’s a game changer.”

The distinction Liu draws between Superagent and competitors is technical. He name-checks Anthropic’s AI agent Claude and Manus (a newer entrant in the AI research space that’s being acquired by Meta) as the only two products with “a true, generally capable, long-running and really smart agent architecture.” Most other so-called agents, he argues, are merely “LLM powered workflows” – predetermined steps with AI calls mixed in, not true autonomous agents that can course-correct and backtrack.

It’s a fine line in a market where everyone is suddenly launching AI agents. OpenAI kicked off 2025 by launching new agent-building tools, while Notion, Harvey, and hundreds of other companies have since added agent functionality. In a market steeped with agent claims, Liu’s insistence that Superagent is different will need to prove itself in practice.

In a blog post announcing the product, Liu provides examples of what Superagent can do. Ask it to evaluate Google as a three-year investment opportunity, he writes, and you get a structured assessment with citations to earnings calls, defensibility analysis against OpenAI and Anthropic, and risk factors you hadn’t considered. Ask it to brief you on Wells Fargo’s AI strategy before pitching them, and you get their regulatory posture, recent AI investments, and specific pain points your product addresses. The system pulls from premium data sources like FactSet, Crunchbase, SEC filings, and earnings transcripts.

The move caps a transformation for Airtable, which Liu has been repositioning as an “AI-native platform.” Last fall, the company brought in David Azose, formerly the engineering lead for ChatGPT’s business products at OpenAI, as CTO. At the same time, it acquired DeepSky (formerly Gradient), an AI agents startup that had raised $40 million. Superagent will operate semi-independently from Airtable, helmed by DeepSky’s founding trio.

The pricing was still being hammered out as of last week, but it sounded poised to follow the emerging AI products playbook: $20 per month per user at the entry tier, up to $200 for power users, with generous inference credits. “We’re not trying to optimize for profit margin right now,” Liu says.

Whether Superagent becomes the trillion-dollar market Liu envisions or a big bet that doesn’t pan out remains to be seen. The competition is not trivial, and the distinctions Liu draws between “real agents” and the rest may not matter to customers if the others can deliver adequate results faster and cheaper.

But for a CEO whose company has lost $7.7 billion in paper valuation while retaining most of its actual capital, the move shows a willingness to bet on the future rather than protect the present. Indeed, Liu has reframed that earlier valuation compression as a recruiting advantage, telling employees they’re getting “equity that’s actually much more attractively priced than the $11 billion valuation” with significant upside if his bets pay off. He has capital for strategic acquisitions and doesn’t need to raise another round.

Asked if he thinks Superagent is ultimately the bigger opportunity, Liu shrugs — he’s not ruling it out. Airtable “will probably be larger for at least the near term than any new products that we do, including Superagent,” he says. “But I also like being able to bet on Superagent. Optionality is a good thing.”

This is Liu’s version of what he calls “wartime” leadership – a term he admits he once eschewed as needlessly violent but now embraces as apt. “Being very fast on the draw to be able to adapt,” he says, is “the most value-creative way to run things right now.” He quickly adds, “It’s also the most exciting way to do things.”

            <h2>Pinterest to lay off 15% of staff to redirect resources to AI</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pinterest said on Tuesday that it plans to lay off less than 15% of its workforce to cut back on office space and reallocate resources for its AI initiatives. In a regulatory filing, the company noted it expects to complete the layoffs by late September.

The filing stated that Pinterest would be “reallocating resources to AI-focused roles and teams that drive AI adoption and execution” and “prioritizing AI‑powered products and capabilities.”

The company had 4,666 full-time employees at the end of 2024, which means roughly 700 workers will be affected by cuts.

The move comes as Pinterest, and every other tech company, has been investing in AI. A few months ago, the company launched “Pinterest Assistant,” an AI companion users can talk to for shopping advice and recommendations. It also began experimenting with AI-powered personalized boards.

During Pinterest’s last earnings call, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready emphasized the promise of open-source AI models to help the company keep costs down.

The company said it expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of about $35 million to $45 million.

            <h2>Luminar receives a larger $33 million bid for its lidar business</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/luminar-receives-a-larger-33-million-bid-for-its-lidar-business/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Luminar received an even higher bid for its lidar business as a court-run auction concluded on Monday, according to a new filing in the company’s bankruptcy case.

MicroVision, a Redmond, Washington-based company that has been developing its own lidar sensors, submitted a $33 million bid, eclipsing the $22 million that Quantum Computing Inc. laid out a few weeks ago as the so-called “stalking horse” bidder. (Quantum Computing Inc. had upped its bid to $28 million but apparently was unwilling or unable to go higher.)

In a statement, MicroVision said Tuesday that it is acquiring “IP and inventory related to the Iris and Halo lidar sensors, key engineering and operations talent, and certain commercial contracts and orders.”

“It’s no secret that the lidar market has been ripe for disruption and in need of further consolidation,” MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said. “Building on our proven executive leadership in automotive, our history of developing and delivering products in defense, and now an even more expansive portfolio of technologically diverse lidar sensors and advanced perception solutions, we believe MicroVision is ready to upend the industry, enabling widespread commercial adoption and significantly increased safety.”

The sale of Luminar’s lidar business will now be subject to approval by the judge in the bankruptcy case. A hearing is slated for Tuesday afternoon.

It’s not clear if Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell submitted a bid for his company’s lidar assets. Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy the company outright in October 2025 before it filed for bankruptcy, and he expressed an interest on making a bid during the bankruptcy process. Representatives for Russell did not respond to a request for comment.

That said, Russell and Luminar spent the first month of the bankruptcy case fighting over a subpoena. The company has said it is still evaluating whether to take legal action against Russell, tied to his resignation last May, which followed a board-run ethics inquiry. While Russell already turned over his computers to Luminar, he had been holding onto his phone until he received a guarantee from the company that any personal information on the device would be protected. Luminar accused him of dodging the subpoena.

Russell ultimately agreed to accept the subpoena last week. Over the weekend, he and Luminar made a joint filing in court laying out the terms of a protective order regarding his personal information.

If the sale of the lidar assets goes through, it could bring about a fairly swift end to Luminar’s bankruptcy case, which was filed in December. The company has already reached an agreement to sell its other business division, centered around semiconductors, to Quantum Computing Inc. for $110 million.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/chinas-moonshot-releases-a-new-open-source-model-kimi-k2-5-and-a-coding-agent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">China’s Moonshot AI, which is backed by the likes of Alibaba and HongShan (formerly Sequioa China), today released a new open-source model, Kimi K2.5, which understands text, image, and video.

The company said that the model was trained on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens, and that’s why it is natively multimodal. It added that the models are good at coding tasks and handling agent swarms —  an orchestration where multiple agents work together. In released benchmarks, the model matches the performance of the proprietary peers and even beats them in certain tasks.

For instance, in the coding benchmark, the Kimi K2.5 outperforms Gemini 3 Pro at the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, and scores higher than GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on the SWE-Bench Multilingual benchmark. In video understanding, it beats GPT 5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 on VideoMMMU (Video Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding), a benchmark that measures how a model reasons over videos.

Moonshot AI said that on the coding front, while the model can understand text well, users can also feed it images or videos and ask it to make a similar interface shown in those media files.

To let people use these coding capabilities, the company has launched an open-source coding tool called Kimi Code, which would rival Anthropic’s Claude Code or Google’s Gemini CLI. Developers can use Kimi Code through their terminals or integrate it with development software such as VSCode, Cursor, and Zed. The startup said that developers can use images and videos as input with Kimi Code.

Coding tools have gained rapid popularity and are becoming revenue drivers for AI labs. Anthropic announced in November that Claude Code had reached $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue (ARR). Earlier this month, Wired reported that by the end of 2025, the tool had added $100 million to that figure. Moonshot’s Chinese competitor, Deepseek, is set to release a new model with strong coding chops next month, according to a report by The Information.

Moonshot was founded by former Google and Meta AI researcher Yang Zhilin. The company raised $1 billion in funding in a Series B round at a $2.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, the startup picked up $500 million in funding last month at $4.3 billion valuation. What’s more, the report noted that it is already seeking to raise a new round at a $5 billion valuation.

            <h2>Bring Back Moral Fiction</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/george-saunders-moral-novel-vigil/685772/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was once commonly understood that fiction was in the wisdom business, that it offered not only aesthetic pleasure but also moral improvement. This function of literature was not tough to spot. One of the first English novels was Samuel Richardson’s 1740 work, Pamela: Or, Virtue Rewarded—a title not meant ironically. Through the 19th century, many authors turned directly to the reader with philosophical and social (if sometimes ironic) commentary: “It is a truth universally acknowledged”; “It was the best of times”; “All happy families are alike.” For readers not up to the challenge of full George Eliot novels, her enterprising publisher compiled a volume of Eliot’s many Wise, Witty, and Tender Sayings, in order to more broadly distribute “a morality as pure as it is impassioned.”

Such open authorial musing, and maybe literature’s wisdom-seeking function itself, has been out of vogue during the past century of show-don’t-tell storytelling. Although this has surely spared us some clunky sermonizing, it has brought downsides as well. Too many writers seem to have overlooked what I consider to be a key piece of the mission. I can’t tell you how many novels I’ve abandoned in the belief that the writer has nothing to teach me—and, worse, is not even trying to learn. Over the past couple of years, as the evident decline of literary reading has been blamed on the ubiquity of smartphones or the supposed withdrawal of men, I’ve suspected that some readers might be tuning out fiction (or turning to the classics over contemporary work) for another reason: the sense that today’s novelists are not aiming to help with the practical matter of how to live.

George Saunders is an eminent exception to contemporary literature’s broader retreat from wisdom-seeking. The Booker-winning and best-selling author has not embedded direct, Eliot-style philosophizing within his fiction, but he is distinctive for thoroughly embracing the role of moral guide—and for seeing his preacher-writer role resonate with an unusually large audience. His fiction has always had an ethical thrust, at its strongest in inventive and often brilliant short stories that channel the economically weak and exploited. And Saunders’s enterprising publisher has lately offered his wise, witty, and tender sayings in stand-alone works: Congratulations, by the Way was adapted from a graduation speech enjoining kindness; A Swim in a Pond in the Rain is a version of his Syracuse University course about Russian writers who, he explains, “regard fiction not as something decorative but as a vital moral-ethical tool.” In A Swim, Saunders has given grateful critics a tidy summary of his message: “that every human being is worthy of attention and that the origins of every good and evil capability of the universe may be found by observing a single, even very humble, person and the turnings of his or her mind.”

Amen. I mean that sincerely. So it was with some disappointment that I discovered that Saunders’s new novel, Vigil—although showcasing his great gifts for voice, farce, and tick-tick-tick plotting—suffers from the all-too-human foible of claiming high ideals while failing to actually abide by them. As in some too-pious novels of earlier eras, Vigil’s abundantly clear moral vision is enabled only by dodging the hardest ethical (and artistic) problem: the pragmatic task of fitting our morals to the confounding reality of human experience.

Like Lincoln in the Bardo, Saunders’s other novel, Vigil is set on the spooky cusp between life and death. The narrator, Jill, is essentially a supernatural priest—a ghost whose task is to swoop into the minds of the dying to provide “comfort” and “elevation” before judgment is rendered. Murdered at age 22, Jill has, after inhabiting and forgiving her murderer, reached a special state of being: “vast, unlimited in the range and delicacy of my voice, unrestrained in love, rapid in apprehension, skillful in motion, capable, equally, of traversing, within a few seconds’ time, a mile or ten thousand miles.” (Never has a novelist found a tidier vehicle for his own mission.) Jill has learned in her elevated state to see every individual as “an inevitable occurrence,” a fated being with choices “so severely delimited” that what feels like free will is actually “a sort of lavish jailing.”

Jill’s “charge,” her new assignment, is an oil tycoon named K. J. Boone, who at 87 is dying of cancer and past the point of speech. In the novel’s first pages, Jill observes a wall of photos: Boone on oil rigs, at his many homes, and “leaning confidently against a podium, speaking to a tremendous crowd.” When she enters his mind, she finds “a steady flow of satisfaction, even triumph.” She scans for doubts and mistakes but finds “nothing, or nearly nothing. He was as sure of himself as ever a charge of mine had been.”

It was an odd thing to finish Vigil feeling that an oil tycoon had been treated unfairly. Saunders has for decades critiqued capitalist systems, but still, I figured I knew where this deathbed visitation must go: As Jill observed the turnings of Boone’s mind, she would uncover the self-satisfied titan’s hidden nobility and frailty; meanwhile, Boone would confront his uncertainties and failings, and the false caricatures at the novel’s start would by the end give way to a nuanced, proportionate truth.

What happens instead is more like a mobbing. Boone is relentlessly hounded by figments of his guilty memory, by other ghosts, and by his daughter—all of whom emphasize his nefarious role in delaying action to combat climate change. The lead ghost campaigner, a slapstick Frenchman, pelts Boone with apparitions: odd weather patterns, extinct birds, a starved man from a decimated Indian village. Boone’s daughter, praying at his bedside, veers into thinking about a documentary that one of her “libdope” friends tricked her into watching, which left her greatly disappointed in her father. Boone refuses chance after chance to admit error.

Although the prosecution of Boone is, characteristically of Saunders, often funny and sometimes moving, it is also unmistakably unkind. Saunders seems unwilling to convey Boone’s more sympathetic attributes without some swift reminder that he’s a bastard. Boone is self-made, but his memories of a dirt-poor childhood are undercut, one page later, by a scene in which he berates his employees and enjoys it. We see Boone snap at his “chubby bimbo” oncology nurse, call Jill a “stupid bitch,” and repeatedly insist that in his whole life, he “had done nothing wrong, not a goddamn thing,” and that anyone who suggests otherwise is an “idiot.” Of his exceptional professional success—Boone’s entire career—we are told only that “it had all been accomplished” with “work, hard work, but no real struggle. Up, up, up he went” and “never along the way had there been a moment of hesitation or doubt” until these “losers, trivial people,” began to “piss and moan” about climate change.

Read: ‘The Moron Factory,’ a short story by George Saunders

Boone’s major crime is, rather than selling oil to a world hungry for it, an act of dishonesty—largely a lie of omission. Although his company’s internal data showed a warming planet, Boone gave speeches, funded research, and sponsored lobbying and advertising campaigns to muddle the scientific consensus and delay regulatory action. This is an interesting choice of sin, because the failure to cop to inconvenient truths is precisely the cardinal sin of Vigil itself: the refusal to let Jill or Boone become more complex than cartoons.

Jill remains impossibly sentimental and pure of heart, even as she grows horrified by Boone and considers abandoning her effort to comfort him. As for Boone, we might invoke the Russians. Saul Bellow once wrote that what made Dostoyevsky a great novelist was his understanding that “the writer’s convictions, perhaps fanatically held, must be tamed by truth.” It seems to me that Saunders’s perhaps fanatical loathing of oil executives—Boone bears many similarities, in particular, to former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond—was not here tamed by the reality of how people find their roles in the world and justify the (sometimes villainous) choices those roles might require. Saunders proffers no evidence that Boone, say, wrestled with the responsibilities of leadership, or was charming or generous, or cared to do anything with other people but dominate them. One truth of which Vigil seems deliberately oblivious is that many of those who inspire confidence and deference, as Boone did, have something going for them. But the book cannot credit Boone with commonplace human thoughtfulness. Even his allies damn him by association: His fond daughter’s prayers reveal her to be a haughty, materialistic racist, and the ghosts of his former collaborators are transparently demonic, letting loose “hellish cackling laughter” at the memory of duping the public. I had the feeling of watching a show trial in which the defense, under the gaze of a stern commissar, has been forbidden to make a case.

I will avoid spoiling the precise mechanics of the ending, except to say that the reader’s satisfaction in Jill’s ultimate choice depends on a familiar idea that even the worst sinners deserve another chance—as long as they confess. This might be an ordinary perspective for a priest, but it felt strangely authoritarian for a fiction writer. Vigil’s lesson appears to be that right is right, wrong is wrong, and the primary challenge of virtuous living lies not in discerning or applying wisdom but rather in mustering, from a state of completed revelation, the grace to admit and forgive crystal-clear sins. The confidence of Vigil’s final judgment seems out of step with Saunders’s view, as stated in A Swim, that “the aim of art” is “to ask the big questions” such as: “How are we supposed to be living down here?”

I should at this point concede that I enjoyed every swift page of Vigil’s prose. It is stuffed with lively wit and striking images, and I was delighted as usual by Saunders’s ability, like that of Hollywood’s defter practitioners, to rib himself and winkingly manipulate his tropes. But I was taken aback by the malice of staging a deathbed inquisition that reduces the decedent, whatever his offenses, to cliché. I would argue, if I might preach at Saunders for a moment, that the most sacred duty of the writer is to do full justice—to inhabit, alongside even maddening wickedness, a charitable understanding of the way a person sees himself—and that to do so is much kinder than merely offering a caricatured figure a shot at avoiding eternal torment.

Saunders has done far better, in Lincoln and in stories such as “Pastoralia” and “The Semplica-Girl Diaries,” both at depicting the morally compromised and at humanely deflating the apparently righteous. My disappointment in Vigil came down to the waste of a perfect setup for exhibiting the worldly redemption of art—that is, its power to redeem us from insensitivity and self-satisfaction. Maybe despite Saunders’s best intentions, the novel instead stubbornly insists on a brutal worldview in which the way someone first appears turns out to be exactly how they are. In such a world, literature cannot serve much moral purpose. Perhaps it is an inevitable occurrence, as Jill would put it, that with age and eminence, we become a bit too firm in our judgments. Thank goodness, then, that so much can be forgiven.

            <h2>Minnesota Proved MAGA Wrong</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/the-neighbors-defending-minnesota-from-ice/685769/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took only a few minutes before everyone in the church knew that another person had been shot. I was sitting with Trygve Olsen, a big man in a wool hat and puffy vest, who lifted his phone to show me a text with the news. It was his 50th birthday, and one of the coldest days of the year. I asked him whether he was doing anything special to celebrate. “What should I be doing?” he replied. “Should I sit at home and open presents? This is where I’m supposed to be.”

He had come to Iglesia Cristiana La Viña Burnsville, about 15 miles south of the Twin Cities, to pick up food for families who are too afraid to go out—some have barely left home since federal immigration agents deployed to Minnesota two months ago. The church was filled with pallets of frozen meat and vegetables, diapers, fruit, and toilet paper. Outside, a man wearing a leather biker vest bearing the insignia of the Latin American Motorcycle Association, his blond beard flecked with ice crystals, directed a line of cars through the snow.

The man who had been shot—fatally, we later learned—was Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who had been recording agents outside a donut shop. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security claimed that he had threatened agents with a gun; videos of the shooting show him holding only his phone when he is pushed down by masked federal agents and beaten, his licensed sidearm removed from its holster by one agent before another unloads several shots into his back. Pretti’s death was a reminder—if anyone in Minnesota still needed one—that people had reason to be hiding, and that those trying to help them, protect them, or protest on their behalf had reason to be scared.

The church has a mostly Hispanic and working-class flock. Its pastor, Miguel Aviles, who goes by Pastor Miguel, told me that it had sent out about 2,000 packages of food since the federal agents had arrived. Many of the people in hiding, he said, “have asylum cases pending. They already have work permits and stuff, but some of them are legal residents and still they’re afraid to go out. Because of their skin color, they are afraid to go out.”

Federal agents have arrested about 3,000 people in the state, but they have released the names of only about 240 of those detained, leaving unclear how many of the larger number have committed any crimes. Many more thousands of people have been affected by the arrests and the fear they have instilled. Minneapolis Public Radio estimates that in school districts “with widespread federal activity, as many as 20 to 40 percent of students have been absent in recent weeks.”

I don’t know what the feds expected when they surged into Minnesota. In late November, The New York Times reported on a public-benefit fraud scheme in the state that was executed mainly by people of Somali descent. Federal prosecutors under the Biden administration had already indicted dozens of people, but after the Times story broke, President Trump began ranting about Somalis, whom he referred to as “garbage”; declared that he didn’t want Somali immigrants in the country; and announced that he was sending thousands of armed federal immigration agents to Minneapolis. This weekend, he posted on social media that the agents were there because of “massive monetary fraud.” The real reason may be that a majority of Minnesotans did not vote for him. Trump has said that “I won Minnesota three times, and I didn’t get credit for it. That’s a crooked state.” He has never won Minnesota.

Perhaps the Trump-administration officials had hoped that a few rabble-rousers would get violent, justifying the kind of crackdown he seems to fantasize about. Maybe they had assumed that they would find only a caricature of “the resistance”—people who seethed about Trump online but would be unwilling to do anything to defend themselves against him.

Instead, what they discovered in the frozen North was something different: a real resistance, broad and organized and overwhelmingly nonviolent, the kind of movement that emerges only under sustained attacks by an oppressive state. Tens of thousands of volunteers—at the very least—are risking their safety to defend their neighbors and their freedom. They aren’t looking for attention or likes on social media. Unless they are killed by federal agents, as Pretti and Renee Good were, other activists do not even necessarily know their names. Many use a handle or code name out of fear of government retaliation. Their concerns are justified: A number of people working as volunteers or observers told me that they had been trailed home by ICE agents, and some of their communications have already been infiltrated, screenshotted, and posted online, forcing them to use new text chains and code names. One urgent question among observers, as the videos of Pretti’s killing spread, was what his handle might have been.

Olsen had originally used the handle “Redbear” in communicating with me, but later said I could name him. He had agreed to let me ride along while he did his deliveries. As he loaded up his truck with supplies, he wore just a long-sleeved red shirt and vest, apparently unfazed by the Minnesota cold.

“This is my first occupation,” Olsen said as I climbed into the truck. “Welcome to the underground, I guess.”

The number of Minnesotans resisting the federal occupation is so large that relatively few could be characterized as career activists. They are ordinary Americans—people with jobs, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. They can be divided into roughly three groups.

The largest is the protesters, who show up at events such as Friday’s march in downtown Minneapolis, and at the airport, where deportation flights take off. Many protesters have faced tear gas and pepper spray, and below-zero temperatures—during the Twin Cities march on Friday, I couldn’t take notes; the ink in my pens had frozen.

Then there are the people who load up their car with food, toiletries, and school supplies from churches or schools to take to families in hiding. They also help families who cannot work meet their rent or mortgage payments. In addition to driving around with Olsen, I rode along with a Twin Cities mom of young kids named Amanda as she did deliveries (she asked me to use only her first name). Riding in her small car—her back row was taken up by three child seats and a smattering of stray toys—she told me that she’d gotten involved after more than 100 students at her kids’ elementary school simply stopped coming in. Parents got organized to provide the families with food, to shepherd their kids to school, and to arrange playdates for those stuck inside.

Amanda’s father and husband are immigrants, she said, and she speaks Spanish. “I can be a conduit between those who want to help and those who need help,” she told me. She calls each family before knocking on the door, so they don’t have to worry that they are being tricked by ICE. At one home, a woman asked us to go around back because a suspicious vehicle was idling out front. At another home, a little girl in pigtails beamed as Amanda handed her a Target bag full of school supplies.

Finally, there’s those most at risk of coming into violent contact with federal agents, a group that’s come to be popularly known as ICE Watch, although the designation is unofficial—as far as I can tell, you’re in ICE Watch if you watch ICE. These are the whistle-wielding pedestrians and drivers calling themselves “observers” or “commuters” who patrol for federal agents (usually identifiable by their SUVs with out-of-state plates) and alert the neighborhood to their presence. Pretti and Good, the two Minneapolis residents killed by federal agents, fit in this category.

Trump-administration officials and MAGA influencers have repeatedly called these activists “violent” and said they are involved in “riots.” But the resistance in Minnesota is largely characterized by a conscious, strategic absence of physical confrontation. Activists have made the decision to emphasize protection, aid, and observation. When matters escalate, it is usually the choice of the federal agents. Of the three homicides in Minneapolis this year, two were committed by federal agents.

“There’s been an incredible, incredible response from the community. I’ve seen our neighbors go straight from allies to family—more than family—checking in on each other, offering food and rides for kids and all kinds of support, alerting each other if there’s ICE or any kind of danger,” Malika Dahir, a local activist of Somali descent, told me.

If the Minnesota resistance has an overarching ideology, you could call it “neighborism”—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from. The contrast with the philosophy guiding the Trump administration couldn’t be more extreme. Vice President Vance has said that “it is totally reasonable and acceptable for American citizens to look at their next-door neighbors and say, ‘I want to live next to people who I have something in common with. I don’t want to live next to four families of strangers.’” Minnesotans are insisting that their neighbors are their neighbors whether they were born in Minneapolis or Mogadishu. That is, arguably, a deeply Christian philosophy, one apparently loathed by some of the most powerful Christians in America.

On Wednesday, I met with two volunteers who went by the handles “Green Bean” and “Cobalt.” They picked me up in the parking lot of a Target, not far from where Good was killed two weeks earlier. Cobalt works in tech but has recently been spending more time on patrol than at her day job. Green Bean is a biologist, but she told me the grant that had been funding her work hadn’t been renewed under the Trump administration. Neither of them had imagined doing what they were doing now. “I’m supposed to be creeping around in the woods looking at insects,” Green Bean said.

Most commuters work in pairs—a co-pilot listens in on a dispatcher who provides the locations of ICE encounters and can run plates through a database of cars that federal agents have used in the past. Green Bean explained what happens when they identify an ICE vehicle. (Both ICE and Border Patrol are in Minneapolis, but everyone just calls them ICE.) The commuters will follow the agents, honking loudly, until they leave the neighborhood or stop and get out.

The commuters—as my colleague Robert Worth reported—do not have a centralized leadership but have been trained by local activist groups that have experience from past protests against police killings, and recent immigration-enforcement sweeps in L.A. and Chicago. The observers are taught to conscientiously follow the law, including traffic rules, and to try to avoid physical confrontation with federal agents.

If the agents detain someone, the observers will try to get that person’s name so they can inform the family. But ICE prefers to make arrests—which the ICE Watchers call “abductions”—quietly. More often than not, Green Bean said, when these volunteers draw attention, the agents will “leave rather than dig in.” She added, “They are huge pussies, I will be honest.”

As we cruised through the Powderhorn neighborhood, practically every business had an ICE OUT sign in the window. Graffiti trashing ICE was everywhere, as were posters of Good labeled AMERICAN MOM KILLED BY ICE. Listening to the dispatcher, Cobalt relayed directions to Green Bean about the locations of ICE vehicles, commuters who had been boxed in or threatened by agents, and possible “abductions.”

About 30 minutes into the patrol, Green Bean saw a white Jeep Wagoneer with out-of-state plates and read out the numbers. “Confirmed ICE,” Cobalt said, and we began following the Wagoneer as it drove through the neighborhood. Another car of commuters joined us, making as much noise as possible.

After about 10 minutes, the Wagoneer got onto the highway. Green Bean followed until we could be sure that it wasn’t doubling back to the neighborhood, and then we turned around.

Most encounters with ICE end like that. But sometimes situations deteriorate—as with Good, who was killed while doing a version of what Green Bean and Cobalt were now doing. The task is stressful for the observers, who understand that even minor encounters can turn deadly.

The next day, I drove around with another pair of commuters who went by “Judy” and “Lime.” Both told me they were anti-Zionist Jews who had been involved in pro-Palestinian and Black Lives Matter protests. Lime’s day job is with an abortion-rights organization, and Judy is a rabbi. “I did protective presence in the West Bank,” Lime told me, referring to a form of protest in which activists try to deter settler violence by simply being present in Palestinian communities. “This is very similar.”

About an hour into our drive, we came across an ICE truck. Judy started blaring the horn, and I heard her mutter to herself: “We’re just driving, we’re just driving, which is legal. I hate this.” I asked them both if they were scared. “I do not feel scared, but I probably should,” Lime said.

Judy said she had been out on patrol days after Good was killed, and had gotten boxed in and yelled at by federal agents. “It was very scary,” Judy told me. “Murdering someone definitely works as an intimidation tactic. You just have no idea what is going to happen.” She said that ICE agents had taken a picture of her license plate and then later showed up at her house, leaning out of their car to take another picture—making it clear to Judy that they knew who she was.

Green Bean had told me the same thing—that agents had come to her house, followed her when she left, and then blocked her vehicle and screamed at her to “stop fucking following us. This is your last warning.” Green Bean was able to laugh while retelling this. “I just stared at them until they left,” she said.

We drove past Good’s memorial. Tributes to her—flowers and letters—were still there, covered in a light powder of snow. We didn’t yet know at the time that residents would soon set up another memorial, for Pretti.

The broad nature of the civil resistance in Minnesota should not lead anyone to believe that no one there supports what ICE is doing. Plenty of people do. Trump came close to winning the state in 2024, and many people here, especially outside the Twin Cities, believe the administration’s rhetoric about targeting “the worst of the worst,” despite what the actual statistics reveal.

“You don’t have to go too far south” to find places where Minnesotans “welcome ICE into their restaurants and bars and sort of love what they do,” Tom Jenkins, the lead pastor of Mount Cavalry Lutheran Church in suburban Eagan, which is also helping with food drives, told me. “A lot of people are still cheering ICE on because they don’t think that whatever people are telling them or showing them is real.”

Although most of the coverage has understandably focused on the cities, suburban residents told me that they had seen operations all over the state. “There are mobile homes not far from where I live,” Jenkins said. Agents “were there every day, you know: 10, 15, 20 agents working the bus stops and bus drop-offs.” He added: “They’re all over.”

Even among those involved in opposing ICE in Minnesota, people have a range of political views. The nonviolent nature of the movement, and the focus on caring for neighbors, has drawn in volunteers with many different perspectives on immigration, including people who might have been supportive if the Trump administration’s claims of a targeted effort to deport violent criminals had been sincere.

“One of the things that I believe, and I know most of the Latino community agrees, is that we want the bad people out. We want the criminals out,” Pastor Miguel, who immigrated from Mexico 30 years ago, told me. “All of us came here looking for a better life for us and for our children. So when we have criminals, rapists—when we have people who have done horrible things in our streets, in our communities—we are afraid of them. We don’t want them here.”

The problem is that federal agents are not going after just criminals. Growing distraught, Pastor Miguel said that one of the men who helped organize the food drive, a close friend of his who he believed had legal status, had been picked up by federal agents the day before I visited.

“I just—I didn’t have words,” he said. “And yet I cannot crumble; I cannot fall. Because all these families also need us.”

Two days after Pretti was killed, my colleague Nick Miroff broke the news that Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who had led the operation in Minneapolis, would be leaving the city and replaced by Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan. Bovino, strutting around in body armor or his distinctive long coat, seemed to relish his role as a villain to his critics, encouraging aggressive tactics by federal agents and sometimes engaging in them himself. The day I accompanied Green Bean and Cobalt, Bovino fumbled with a gas canister before throwing it into a sparse crowd of protesters.

Bovino’s departure seemed an admission that Minnesotans aren’t the only Americans who won’t tolerate more deaths at the hands of federal agents. The people of Minnesota have forced the Trump administration into a strategic retreat—one inflicted not as rioters or insurgents, but as neighbors.

After Friday’s protest, when thousands marched in frigid downtown Minneapolis, chanting, “No Trump, no troops, Twin Cities ain’t licking boots!” I spoke with a young protester named Ethan McFarland, who told me that his parents are immigrants from Uganda. He had recently asked his mother to show him her immigration papers, in case she got picked up. This kind of state oppression, he said, is exactly what his mother was “trying to get away from” when she came to the United States.

McFarland’s remarks reminded me of something Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser, had written: “Migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” In Minnesota, the opposite was happening. The “conditions and terrors” of immigrants’ “broken homelands” weren’t being re-created by immigrants. They were being re-created by people like Miller. The immigrants simply have the experience to recognize them.

The federal surge into Minneapolis reflects a series of mistaken MAGA assumptions. The first is the belief that diverse communities aren’t possible: “Social bonds form among people who have something in common,” Vance said in a speech last July. “If you stop importing millions of foreigners into the country, you allow social cohesion to form naturally.” Vance’s remarks are the antithesis to the neighborism of the Twin Cities, whose people do not share the narcissism of being capable of loving only those who are exactly like them.

A second MAGA assumption is that the left is insincere in its values, and that principles of inclusion and unity are superficial forms of virtue signaling. White liberals might put a sign in their front yard saying IMMIGRANTS WELCOME, but they will abandon those immigrants at the first sensation of sustained pressure.

And in Trump’s defense, this has turned out to be true of many liberals in positions of power—university administrators, attorneys at white-shoe law firms, political leaders. But it is not true of millions of ordinary Americans, who have poured into the streets in protest, spoken out against the administration, and, in Minnesota, resisted armed men in masks at the cost of their own life.

The MAGA faith in liberal weakness has been paired with the conviction that real men—Trump’s men—are conversely strong. Consider Miller’s bizarre meltdown while addressing Memphis police in October. “The gangbangers that you deal with—they think that they’re ruthless? They have no idea how ruthless we are. They think they’re tough? They have no idea how tough we are,” Miller said. “They think they’re hard-core? We are so much more hard-core than they are.” Around this time, Miller moved his family onto a military base—for safety reasons.

The federal agents sent to Minnesota wear body armor and masks, and bear long guns and sidearms. But their skittishness and brutality are qualities associated with fear, not resolve. It takes far more courage to stare down the barrel of a gun while you’re armed with only a whistle and a phone than it does to point a gun at an unarmed protester.

Every social theory undergirding Trumpism has been broken on the steel of Minnesotan resolve. The multiracial community in Minneapolis was supposed to shatter. It did not. It held until Bovino was forced out of the Twin Cities with his long coat between his legs.

The secret fear of the morally depraved is that virtue is actually common, and that they’re the ones who are alone. In Minnesota, all of the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at once. Minnesotans, not the armed thugs of ICE and the Border Patrol, are brave. Minnesotans have shown that their community is socially cohesive—because of its diversity and not in spite of it. Minnesotans have found and loved one another in a world atomized by social media, where empty men have tried to fill their lonely soul with lies about their own inherent superiority. Minnesotans have preserved everything worthwhile about “Western civilization,” while armed brutes try to tear it down by force.

No matter how many more armed men Trump sends to impose his will on the people of Minnesota, all he can do is accentuate their valor. No application of armed violence can make the men with guns as heroic as the people who choose to stand in their path with empty hands in defense of their neighbors. These agents, and the president who sent them, are no one’s heroes, no one’s saviors—just men with guns who have to hide their faces to shoot a mom in the face, and a nurse in the back.</div>

            <h2>Greg Bovino Loses His Job</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gregory Bovino has been removed from his role as Border Patrol “commander at large” and will return to his former job in El Centro, California, where he is expected to retire soon, according to a DHS official and two people with knowledge of the change.

Bovino’s sudden demotion is the clearest sign yet that the Trump administration is reconsidering its most aggressive tactics after the killing Saturday of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents under Bovino’s command.

Earlier today, President Trump appeared to signal in a series of social-media posts a tactical shift in the administration’s mass-deportation campaign. Trump wrote that he spoke with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—whom the White House has blamed for inciting violence—and the two men are now on “a similar wavelength.” Tom Homan, the former ICE chief whom Trump has designated “border czar,” will head to Minnesota to assume command of the federal mobilization there, Trump said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her close adviser Corey Lewandowski, who were Bovino’s biggest backers at DHS, are also at risk of losing their jobs, two of the people told me.

Read: The hype man of Trump’s mass deportations

For the past seven months, Bovino has been the public face of a traveling immigration crackdown on cities governed by Democrats. Noem and other Trump officials gave Bovino the “commander” title and sent him and his masked border agents to Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans, and then Minneapolis. Bovino became a MAGA social-media star as he traveled the country with his own film crew and used social media to hit back at Democratic politicians and random critics online. Veteran ICE and CBP officials grew more and more uneasy as Bovino worked outside his agency’s chain of command and appeared to relish his role as a political actor.

In Minneapolis, the Trump administration used Bovino as its lead spokesperson, scheduling daily press conferences where he defended agents’ rough tactics and cast blame on protesters and local officials. Border Patrol commanders typically avoid engaging in political arguments with elected officials.

Bovino’s fall comes two days after Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis fatally shot Pretti, an intensive-care nurse who worked with veterans. Hours after the shooting, Bovino appeared at a press conference and echoed statements by the Department of Homeland Security alleging Pretti sought to “massacre” the federal agents. Bovino repeatedly claimed that Border Patrol agents, not Pretti, were the victims.

Videos of the encounter showed no evidence for his claims. Pretti, who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, did not draw a firearm or attack the agents. The videos show one agent disarming Pretti in the moments just before another agent shot him in the back.

DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials did not immediately respond to questions about Bovino’s departure from Minnesota and his current role. Asked about Bovino and Noem, a White House spokesperson referred to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s statement today that Noem has the president’s “utmost confidence and trust.”

In another post, Trump said he also spoke with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “Lots of progress is being made!” the president wrote. “Tom Homan will be meeting with him tomorrow in order to continue the discussion.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Perhaps the most disturbing part of the Trump administration’s immigration operation in Minnesota is not just that agents of the state are killing peacefully protesting citizens on the streets. It’s that they’re doing it with the expectation of impunity, backed by top government officials who are brazenly lying about what happened.

The response from President Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and other officials has sent a clear message: When immigration agents kill peaceful protesters, the government will defend them unconditionally, no matter if clear video evidence contradicts its version of events. It will resist investigating shootings, and it will do everything it can to block probes by other authorities. Vice President Vance has even claimed that federal agents have “absolute immunity” for their actions. This approach all but guarantees more killings.

The culture of impunity runs from the bottom to the top. It includes the federal agents who shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, multiple times in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, despite videos that appear to show that the agents had already removed his holstered gun, and despite knowing that many bystanders were filming. (If this is what Border Patrol feels comfortable doing on camera, one can only guess how they might act in private.) It also encompasses the administration officials who offered false accounts immediately, without bothering to wait for the facts.

Videos show Pretti filming officers before being pepper-sprayed and tackled by multiple officers, who then shot him while he was on the ground. Yet the Homeland Security secretary accused Pretti of “domestic terrorism” and said that he’d “attacked” agents, a claim that FBI Director Kash Patel repeated. Noem also said that Pretti had been “brandishing” a gun. (He had been legally carrying a concealed weapon, a right that the administration has previously celebrated.) Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche argued that because Pretti was shouting and had “a phone right up to ICE’s face,” he was not protesting peacefully. The Trump aide Stephen Miller labeled him an “assassin,” and the Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said that Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” No known evidence backs any of this up, and videos show that much of it is provably false.

When law-enforcement officers shoot civilians, it is common—if unsavory—for government officials to defend them. The Trump administration has gone far beyond this. Fatal shootings are almost always subject to investigation. After an ICE agent killed Renee Good earlier this month, Blanche (who once was Trump’s personal lawyer) said that the FBI would not launch a civil-rights investigation into the shooting. Instead, MS NOW reported, the Justice Department instructed the FBI to seek a search warrant to investigate Good for possible criminal liability. A federal magistrate rejected the warrant, which is unusual—except that, as the magistrate noted, Good is dead and could not legally be considered a suspect. An FBI agent resigned after she was allegedly pressured to stop pursuing a civil-rights inquiry into the ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, who’d shot Good.

Something similar started to play out immediately after Pretti’s death. Federal agencies seem unsure what, if any, investigation is occurring, according to The Washington Post, although White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said today that DHS and CBP are investigating the Pretti shooting, including reviewing body-cam footage. Federal agents refused to give even “the most basic information” to Minneapolis police at the scene, Chief Brian O’Hara said yesterday, and they initially blocked the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state’s criminal-investigation office, from accessing the crime scene. The state then went to court and obtained an order from a (Trump-appointed) federal judge blocking the destruction of evidence. That such a move was even necessary is astonishing.

A state-level agency like the BCA has nowhere near the resources or expertise that federal agencies do, and local investigators face legal hurdles when investigating federal agents. Yet administration officials have so clearly declared their position with lies and prejudicial statements that any federal investigation would be suspect from the start—another example of how Trump’s politicization of the Justice Department has undermined its ability to do its job.

Compared with the aftermath of Good’s shooting, more Republicans are expressing concerns about the operation in Minneapolis and Pretti’s killing. Even Trump has vacillated somewhat. He blamed Democrats for Pretti’s death but was noncommittal in a conversation with The Wall Street Journal about whether the agents involved had acted appropriately, in contrast to his quick blaming of Good for her own death. He has since conceded that ICE agents may have made a “mistake” in her case. Vance has also backtracked some, abandoning his claims of “absolute immunity.” (Law-enforcement officers are entitled to what’s known as “qualified immunity,” or protection from liability unless breaking clear legal or constitutional boundaries.)

Even as Republicans grow wary, they have tried to blame Trump’s aides rather than the president himself; Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, for example, lamented that the president was “getting bad advice.” But the culture of impunity proceeds directly from Trump. He has enthusiastically embraced the idea that the federal government should serve his personal whims. He argued that investigations into himself, even for overt offenses such as taking home boxes of sensitive documents, were improper. And he has made clear that when people act to assist him, whether they are aides or January 6 rioters, he will use his clemency powers to protect them from consequences.

Trump has spent years dehumanizing immigrants, exhorting law enforcement to treat suspects more roughly, and attacking the rule of law. The killings in Minnesota aren’t the collateral damage of Trump’s approach to governance. They’re a direct result.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Anyone who thinks the contemplative life amounts to a form of quietism or a retreat from the world’s suffering should spend some time shadowing Joan Halifax, the Zen priest and anthropologist. I’d been curious about Halifax for years, ever since I heard about an annual trek that she leads through the mountains of Nepal, bringing a cadre of doctors and dentists to remote mountain villages with little access to health care.

Each summer over the course of two weeks or so, this Nomads Clinic covers more than 100 miles on foot and horseback, at altitudes of nearly 18,000 feet. These “medical mountaineers,” as they’ve been called, all volunteers, sleep in tents, often in freezing temperatures. But after some 40 annual trips to Nepal—Halifax is normally based in Santa Fe—she recently decided it was time to hang it up.

Watch. Last Saturday’s “Weekend Update” segment (streaming on Peacock) explains how Saturday Night Live benefits from making pop culture a little bit cringe, Michael Tedder writes.

Read. Before her murder made her a true-crime obsession, Elizabeth Short was a real person. Black Dahlia tries to separate truth from myth in the infamous case, Sarah Weinman writes.

Last Wednesday, covering President Trump’s speech at the World Economic Forum, I remarked, “Perhaps the Germans have a word for the experience of watching your country’s leader embarrass himself and the country on the global stage.” Several Germanophone readers wrote in to tell me that, in fact, they do—or at least one that partly captures the feeling. Fremdscham is a term for vicarious embarrassment, a sort of inverse of schadenfreude. I’m going to have to add this one to my vocabulary. Now, if we can only find a way to shoehorn presidential presence into it!

            <h2>ICE Is Failing the Legitimacy Test</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/policing-open-carry-minnesota-pretti/685767/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Carrying a concealed handgun in public is now commonplace in much of the country. For many, this is not only a prudent act of personal safety, but an expression of liberty and a bulwark against government overreach. At the same time, America&#39;s law-enforcement officers insist they must exercise vigilance while patrolling dangerous streets. When officers make a split-second decision to shoot someone who is carrying a gun, many political leaders, especially on the right, believe they need to be given deference because their lives were at risk.

The tension between these two ideas is acute, putting law enforcement and citizens on a potentially catastrophic collision course. One such collision took place in Minnesota on Saturday. It was fatal for the citizen. And it was potentially delegitimizing for law enforcement. A broader crisis of government legitimacy is imminent in the absence of a change in direction by the Trump administration.

Judging from the video evidence and news reports, this is what seems to have taken place: The Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti carried his loaded, concealed 9-mm handgun to a protest against the ICE agents.  He had no criminal record, and a permit to carry the gun. Holding only a phone when an agent moved in to make an arrest, he was pepper-sprayed and thrown to the ground. Then, as federal agents wrestled him into submission, Pretti’s coat rode up and his holstered gun came into view. It set off panicked screams of “Gun!” among the agents. One of them reached in and removed the pistol from Pretti’s waistband; another then drew his own pistol and shot Pretti in the back. Pretti died in the street never having touched his gun. He had been disarmed before the first shot was even fired.

In response to this tragedy, the president of the United States wrote on social media: “LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!”

But surely doing their job well must include respecting the people they serve. For true Second Amendment advocates, Pretti’s decision to bring a gun to a protest in no way excuses his killing. A protester with a gun, they believe, is not courting his own demise. To these advocates, under the Second Amendment, there is no wrong time and place for a citizen to be armed; it is a right that “shall not be infringed.” Some states prohibit guns at protests, but Minnesota is not one of them. As of 2025, more than 20 million Americans held a concealed carry permit. And 29 states have adopted Constitutional Carry, meaning a permit is not required.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

None of this is to say that policing an armed society is easy. It requires highly trained, well-led officers who can navigate incidents including routine calls and crimes in progress with discipline and restraint. It also requires a commitment to transparency—and to accountability, when police wrongly shoot a person exercising their right to carry a gun. In this regard, ICE and the federal government have failed dismally.

ICE agents are poorly screened and quickly hired. They spend just 47 days in their training academy, a shorter duration than nearly all law enforcement organizations; Minnesota, for example, requires about double the training for its police officers at 1,050 hours. In the field, they are saddled with quotas for how many people they must apprehend. That leads to desperate measures and poor decisions. Many of these agents wear masks to conceal their identity and project an air of menace. They regularly flout their own body-camera policy, which their agency is seeking to roll back. They have been instructed to use force to enter homes without the judicial warrant the Constitution requires. They perform poorly at crowd control, resorting to tear gas and pepper spray with an alarming frequency.

Compounding these problems, the federal government has vilified the men and women shot by ICE agents, including U.S. citizens; refused to conduct transparent investigations; and contemptuously blocked state agencies from doing so. Federal officials have declared ICE’s killings lawful and justified over social media without any pretense of a formal review, making statements that are cruel, derogatory, misleading, or simply false. People who want the government to account for what it has done are told to go pound sand.

A particularly vivid example of this dynamic occurred three weeks ago, when an ICE agent, also in Minneapolis, killed Renee Good as she tried to drive away from him. The agency argued that a car on the move is a lethal threat, so an officer who steps in front of a car can shoot a driver who doesn’t stop. The New York City Police Department prohibited shooting at moving vehicles in 1972, and most major cities tightly regulate the practice. Professional police agencies have learned that shooting the driver doesn’t stop the car or make the officer any safer; the best bet is to get out of the way. Rather than explain this contradiction, ICE dismissed criticism, immediately declared Good’s killing necessary and lawful, labeled her a domestic terrorist and the officer a hero, and shut down efforts to investigate the incident. Then the Department of Justice ordered federal prosecutors and the FBI to investigate Good’s family for ties to left-wing radicals, leading several prosecutors to resign. This is not the behavior of government officials who can plausibly argue that they have a legitimate right to use force against citizens.

Contrary to the administration’s feverish claims, the protesters in Minneapolis are not “woke” leftist domestic terrorists confronting responsible law-enforcement officers to foment an insurrection. As best we can tell, among the cast of activists are citizens of every class, ideology, and race, standing up for basic decency and constitutional liberties. One of our mothers-in-law regularly demonstrates against ICE, and she hasn’t protested anything since the Vietnam War. In the face of the dangers posed by armed, masked men who have been reassured by the president that they will receive immunity for their actions—both legally incorrect and a bad idea—these citizens are putting themselves on the line to say that what is happening is inconsistent with America’s most fundamental values.

There is a lot of overlap between the elected officials who exhort Americans to carry guns wherever they like, and the ones who tend to stand by law-enforcement officers who use lethal force. These positions are not always contradictory, but in this situation they are flatly incompatible. If elected officials are going to stump for the Second Amendment, and at the same time refuse to hold a federal agency accountable for killing an American exercising that very right, the country is at risk of losing any right to protest. And the federal government is calling into question its legitimacy.</div>

            <h2>The Worst Thing About the Black Dahlia Case</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elizabeth Short liked to wander. Sometimes this wandering was merely in her mind, watching movies and dreaming of a life far beyond her hometown of Medford, Massachusetts. Many times, it was physical; she’d land in a new city—Miami, Jacksonville, Chicago, Long Beach, San Diego, Los Angeles—and explore its streets on foot. Sometimes her travels revolved around family, as when she tracked down her long-lost father and lived with him for a time—until he cast her out. On January 9, 1947, Short, who was 22, told a gentleman friend to drop her off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where her sister was supposedly waiting. She was never seen alive again.

A contemporary version of Elizabeth—dreamy, elusive, independent, and canny—might be called a flaneuse, someone curious about the world. But we’ll never know what kind of life she would have led; by the time her bisected body was found in a vacant lot, six days after she left the Biltmore, Elizabeth had ceased to be a person. From then on, she became “The Black Dahlia,” an archetype, a myth, a riddle that countless people have attempted to solve in books, films, television shows, podcasts, websites, internet-message boards, and social-media posts.

“After we are dead, the pretense that we may be protected against the world’s careless malice is abandoned,” Janet Malcolm wrote in her book The Silent Woman. She was referring to the poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, another beautiful young woman who died too soon, after which her life and words became grist for the biographical mill. But Malcolm’s words apply equally, even eerily, to the afterlife of Short—one of America’s most famous murder victims, and certainly among the most persistent subjects of the true-crime industrial complex.

From the moment Short’s killing became headline news, sensation was the prime directive. With every new lead, confession, and suspect, the actual Elizabeth receded further. It didn’t help that she was an enigmatic character in life, prone to embellishment and even lies. She recounted tales of woe to paramours only to ask them for money, exaggerated her prospects in missives to her mother, told friends about a dead husband and a child who probably didn’t exist—all without letting on about her actual precarious straits. Short avoided the spotlight, but over the nearly 80 years since her death, it has wholly consumed her.

This kind of flattening happens all too often with murder victims, particularly young women and girls who die at the hands of a serial killer, usually male. (Never mind that more marginalized women, especially women of color, are less likely to merit any attention at all.) In Short’s case, the flattening is particularly egregious, because the inchoate facts of her life are shoehorned into the obsessions of amateur sleuths who continue to get those facts wrong.

Read: A provocative argument about what creates serial killers

William J. Mann’s new book, Black Dahlia: Murder, Monsters, and Madness in Midcentury Hollywood, attempts a different approach: to weave the fragments we have into a narrative whole that prioritizes Short, in all of her contradictions, and tries to debunk decades’ worth of accumulated myths. Although Mann’s effort stands apart from the overlong run of books about the case, it, too, is undercut by the need to name a likely suspect, playing into the true-crime imperative it aims to leave behind.

Mann begins Black Dahlia in late July 1946, several months before Short’s murder and not long after her arrival in Long Beach, California. Over the ensuing period, Short befriends women and dates men; wears sophisticated clothing, ankle-strapped high heels, and flowers in her hair; and comes across as “a very modest girl who never cursed or acted sexy,” in the words of one friend. The reader comes to understand why fascination has proved more appealing than facts: We know very little about her life. Short defied norms and customs. She seemed innocent in the ways of men but savvy enough to keep her dates at a respectful distance. The two women who knew her best during this time, Marjorie Graham and Anne Toth, whom Mann renders more fully than any author before him, still had trouble understanding what made Short tick.

Mann starts the story, however, from the vantage point of Tod Faulkner, who says he first spotted Short in a two-piece bathing suit, walking alone toward the beach, and saw her again several more times that summer. Faulkner was 11 at the time, and says he never forgot her. Yet after growing up to become a journalist, he was the one who immortalized the erroneous middle name “Ann,” in a 1971 article for the Los Angeles Times. Faulkner’s error would propagate in numerous articles, books, and films before being codified in the 1975 TV movie Who Is the Black Dahlia?, which starred Lucie Arnaz (the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz) as Short. Already we have the conflict between truth and myth, and we’re only on page four.

From there, Mann situates the known facts about the last few months of Short’s life in postwar Los Angeles, whose rising murder rate led to an even sharper spike in fear. From 1945 to 1946, “while the homicide rate for men grew by 26.8 percent, the number of women murdered in that same period shot up by 52.9 percent,” Mann points out. Over the next few years, the increase in violent deaths of women, seemingly at the hands of strangers, was reflected in the growing genre of film noir and in novels including Dorothy B. Hughes’s In a Lonely Place, which was published less than a year after Short’s murder.

Fear also sold newspapers, as any tabloid journalist at the time could tell you. And tell people they did, particularly in the early days and weeks after Short’s death, when the tiniest new detail about the “Black Dahlia” investigation—even, or especially, if that detail wasn’t true—could boost circulation. Mann calls out many instances of “sexing up the news” (a phrase he uses multiple times): the description of the block where Short’s body was discovered as a “lover’s lane”; invented testimony from witnesses and family members (including Short’s grieving mother, Phoebe); exaggerations in the memoirs of the L.A. newspaper editors Agness Underwood and Jimmy Richardson, early chroniclers—and shapers—of the murder narrative.

The errors and suppositions would multiply over the decades—most of them cataloged by the former L.A. Times reporter and historian Larry Harnisch. Was Short a sex worker? Blame John Gregory Dunne’s otherwise terrific 1977 novel, True Confessions, which gave its Short stand-in the moniker “The Virgin Tramp” along with a past career in pornography. (Without True Confessions, James Ellroy probably wouldn’t have written his own The Black Dahlia novel in 1987, which led to a 2006 film adaptation.) Did she have sexual dysfunction? That’s an invention of a former Examiner reporter, Will Fowler, bolstered by John Gilmore in his supposedly nonfiction 1994 account, Severed, which includes information from a detective, “Herman Willis,” who doesn’t seem to have existed.

False suspects also proliferated. Was George Hodel the killer? So his son Steve Hodel keeps insisting, first in his 2003 book, Black Dahlia Avenger, then in a later book that also puts George forward as the Zodiac Killer (oy). Janice Knowlton, too, believed that her father murdered Elizabeth: Read about it in Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer. Piu Eatwell’s Black Dahlia, Red Rose initially convinced me that Leslie Dillon was the culprit, but Mann’s account definitively rules Dillon out. Eli Frankel’s Sisters in Death, published just last year, strains (and, to my mind, fails) to connect Short to an unsolved murder in Kansas City. And a new podcast hosted by Michael Connelly, Killer in the Code, also tries to connect the Black Dahlia and the Zodiac Killer, with the help of a “cold-case consultant” who bases his “smoking gun” on a deathbed sketch that better resembles fan art.

Shiftiness, con artistry, and even violence toward women don’t add up to hard, incriminating evidence. Mann, too, succumbs to the temptation, perhaps reluctantly; he spends precious pages explaining why one of Elizabeth’s Long Beach boyfriends, a military veteran named Marvin Margolis who died in 1993—the same suspect in Connelly’s podcast—can’t be ruled out as the killer. (The original detectives crossed him off the list early in the investigation.) Even Mann seems dissatisfied when he mulls the prospect that a stranger killed Short: “She was simply a vulnerable young woman who came face-to-face with someone with severe and violent psychopathology who decided, either on impulse or deliberation, to kill her, to use her body to express rage and resentment at the world.”

After so much time has passed, no one is likely to be satisfied with any identification of Short’s killer. If the lead detective, Harry Hansen, is to be believed, the Los Angeles Police Department never once interviewed the actual killer despite interrogating scores of suspects—including all of those mentioned in prior books, and now Mann’s. Any outcome would likely resemble the identification last September, via investigative genetic genealogy, of the man responsible for the 1991 quadruple homicide in Austin, Texas, known as the “Yogurt Shop Murders.” In that case, pinning down the murderer didn’t erase the 34 years of anguish and damage sustained by the girls’ families and the young men wrongfully convicted—including one who had been on death row. After decades of pain and exploitation, solving the case feels like an anticlimax.

“Solving” the Black Dahlia case, most likely through genetic genealogy, may bring an answer, but it would only generate many more questions. Harnisch, the historian, who knows more about the case than almost anybody (and has a credible theory relegated to a footnote in Mann’s book), put it best in a 2020 interview: “This is a story that fades to conjecture. This is a story without an ending.”

Look past the need for narrative and there, out on the horizon, is Elizabeth Short, walking down a California boulevard, trying to create a better story for herself. She didn’t have to remain forever a girl wounded by her father’s rejection, too proud to admit the truth about her life to her mother and sisters, yet resourceful enough to survive, for a time, in a world that couldn’t care less. Her luck ran out, and we don’t know why, or who killed her. But the brutality of Short’s death shouldn’t supersede her life any more than myth should overshadow a larger truth: that her murder will never truly make any sense.

That&#39;s $2700 more than I&#39;d ever pay for a phone, and I don&#39;t even want a foldable.

No one need most of the phones at the price point they are available. &quot;Need&quot; isn&#39;t what is being addressed here. The world is full of people who don&#39;t give a crap about spending this kind of money, that&#39;s why these luxury products exist.

Men who the ... will buy a thing that don&#39;t even have a microsdcard on it and no stylus.

We will see more and more of these luxury goods coming out that only 10-20% of the people can afford, and they still won&#39;t own it. A smartphone is an expensive device they sell you for good money, and they continue making good money on it, because you have no choice but run the OS and the apps they want you to run. I still can&#39;t understand how most people don&#39;t see or care about that. Happy and own nothing, indeed.

While not wrong: The machine cannot deliver what they promised and people are getting fed up with it.

What the horrible people want is not exactly a perfect overlap with what is realistically possible.

I believe you are remembering a quote from George Orwell&#39;s 1984: &quot;He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.&quot;

Cool story! I got my first 386SX in 1992, with a whopping 2MB RAM, so 1Gb would have blown my mind... &quot;Imagine how well Prince of Persia will run&quot; with my brain at that time xD

How come blatant large-scale download of online and offline copyrighted works and reuse in derivative works is OK if &quot;AI&quot; corporations does it, but download by private persons of similar works for reading / viewing is classified as piracy? (OK, besides the &quot;AI&quot; hype that it&#39;s somehow not a derivative work, &quot;corporate&quot; may be a hint ...)

Alsup ruled that the scanning was format shifting and thus &#39;fair use&#39;. Alsup ruled that their usage of downloaded works for training was &#39;fair use&#39;. But Anthropic kept copies of downloaded works &#39;as a library&#39; - including works they didn&#39;t use for the model training. Alsup ruled that that was not fair use. Alsup also said he would not delay the trial while Anthropic appealed (which is something that usually happens), hence why Anthropic settled.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen an article sit around this long with no comments.

Well, if you&#39;re into ReactOS, I guess it&#39;s proof that you&#39;re not in a rush for anything.

The latest releases of WINE and Proton are doing amazing things. Then looking at FEX-Emu running native 32 & 64-bit Windows software on an ARM Linux PC and having the performance to play modern games.

That said. React could serve some purpose in terms of compatibility. There are still XP installs in many manufacturing and medical research faculties due to multi million dollar devices that don&#39;t have drivers for anything new.

If React could run on modern hardware, while still supporting these older devices

Exactly, running in a VM to support specialized hardware that can&#39;t be ran under a supported version of Windows. React is at least supported versus needing to segment XP and manually transport files over physical media.

General desktop usage, or trying to run an application have so many other options. It doesn&#39;t make sense sticking with React for those use cases.

The problem is ReactOS is a clone of XP more or less. XP is literally so far in the rear view mirror that adults graduating college and entering the workforce were still breast feeding and in a way nobody would get judgmental about when it was released. Its been so long since older workers used it for the most part that any system vaguely similar will be just as familiar or thought about the other way have no more or less learning curve. Slap XFCE or really even KDE on some Linux distro and it will be as us

I would think the market is rather large for one simple reason: People hate change.React or any other windows clone that isn&#39;t nearly in lock step with the UI and feature sets of Win10/11 is change. That was my point.Given the recent push to get away from American IT, ReactOS might be a better choice if you&#39;re trying to avoid America but still want a &quot;Windows&quot; that &quot;works&quot;. A nation state could choose to support the project financially simply as a &quot;fuck you&quot; to the US / Microsoft, which would help a bit. (ReactOS already hires people to work on the project, and it seems to have a non-US bank registry if their donation page is any indication.)I think they even demo&#39;ed it for Putin once. Even the budget constrained Russian state could afford to give React all the patronage they require if that was really the issue and they haven&#39;t. They have had plenty enough reason to want to be off US IT platforms going back to at least 2014.Uh, NO. Microsoft doesn&#39;t really care about consumers pirating Win98, because they have nothing worth the time and effort of a lawsuit to get. Companies running multi-billion-dollar industrial equipment? You bet your ass they&#39;ll be paying you a visit if they find out, and they&#39;ll take you to the cleaners for it.Microsoft isn&#39;t going to go after companies unless maybe you are a fourtune 500 or someth

- WhatsApp supposedly uses the Signal protocol(*), which is as good as is gets with regards to E2EE

- End to end is only as good as the said end-points. In addition to being closed source, the WhatsApp has multiple problems: an AI functionality that needs to send all your chats back to Meta&#39;s cloud unencrypted (as it&#39;s not relying on locally running models) so the AI can summarize and whatever else shit they are advertising; WhatsApp by default backs its data up onto the cloud, so if you lose your phone you can still recover instead of needing to start a new account from scratch.

So I presume it&#39;s a lawsuit where both parties are technically right:- Meta is technically right in affirming that they use the current best standard for E2EE (they mostly are)- The plaintiff are right that the clients (Android app, web app, etc.) are completely leaking data in a zillion different ways (what&#39;s the point in having the best E2EE if said End is going to blast that precious private information in all possible directions?!)

(*): Minus a couple of bits. WhatsApp doesn&#39;t use Signal&#39;s implementation (sealed sender) to hide the meta data of who is chatting with whom AFAIK they only encrypt the message body; the protocol can work without ever needing phone numbers, Signal client is getting there eventually, WhatsApp isn&#39;t touching that either.

Facebook acquired WhatsApp 2 years before (2014) WhatsApp added End to End encryption (2016).

Please stop spreading conspiracy nonsense that is easily disproven.

it would be a lot more difficult to establish communications with new users

No, encryption between any two (initially unknown) parties is a solved cryptographical problem (and when well implemented it would survive any sniffing or even active attacks). AUTHENTICATING the other party is the problem and of course you need in this workflow to trust Whatsapp on that, and nobody ever claimed or thought otherwise I bet. It goes without saying that it&#39;s on them to insure you are talking to the one who has that phone number - not great security but at least not a random attacker, you also trust it to be that app at the other end not Whatsapp themselves ...

When marketing say &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot; they usually mean that the apps use TLS to communicate with the backend servers,That&#39;s not the case here. Supposedly (but hard to check as its closed source) WhatsApp uses the Signal protocol for end-2-end encryption which is as good as it gets. BUT the app is still leaking the chat in a zillion different ways.E.g.: Meta-AI gets CC&#39;d every message because once someone in that group used the &quot;AI summary&quot; functionnality which automatically adds Meta&#39;s cloudd as a party to this group.E.g.: Out of the box, the App backs all its data to the cloud so you can recover your account even if your

The backdoor was probably mandated by the feddy gov.

>&quot;The lawsuit does not provide any technical details to back up the rather sensational claims.&quot;

That is an inherent problem with closed code and closed platforms.  They can claim anything they want and there isn&#39;t much way we can verify their claims.  I admit, this story seems really sensational (a little hard to believe), but it is plausible.

Also, there can be word-trickery here.  It is possible things can be claimed to be &quot;end-to-end encrypted&quot; and yet still have ways for the mothership to decrypt anything at will (by having intentional secret holes/weaknesses, by storing your or another key, or a method they can pull the key from your device through their own control over the app, or by having master keys present at the start).  I think that would be a misuse of the term &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot;, yet term use/definitions mutate all the time.  Anyway this can backfire spectacularly if discovered and lead to a lot of legal issues- if they had denied law enforcement/courts access in the past with the excuse that they can&#39;t decrypt it and then it is discovered they could.

>&quot;Otherwise it would be end-to-middle-to-end encryption, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;

Nope, that would imply it is being decrypted and then re-encrypted in the middle.  That doesn&#39;t have to happen.  It would still have stayed encrypted from one end (sender) to the other end (receiver).  The middle can just store the message and decrypt it later, if needed, if they have access to the keys (now or later) or a weakness/backdoor.

Here we are, arguing about end-to-end-to-man-in-the-middle word trickery, when the real issue is that they use ROT13 encryption.

If it&#39;s just tls then you only have a public key, which is not &quot;having the key&quot;.  Having the private key is what qualifies and for TLS that remains on the server side.

and then there&#39;s GMail with it&#39;s version of &quot;encrypted email&quot;, which only indicates that the first SMTP connection in the chain was secured by TLS.Wording does matter, but wording is the trickery.

Meta, calls the claims &quot;false and absurd.&quot; 
Meta also says they routinely see false claims and speculation like this in lots of users&#39; WhatsApp messages - and none are true. ;-)

Read up on Signals Whisper protocol. There isn&#39;t a single private key that can decrypt all the traffic.

... Meta can get it and read all the messages. How else would they make money?

User connection graphs. They can see who talks to who, who has what contacts, frequency of messages, timing of messages, etc.. That&#39;s extremely valuable to a social network and its advertisers. They don&#39;t need to read the message content to derive value.

Exploiting such loopholes would still leave them open to claims of fraud. They&#39;ve stated in no uncertain terms [whatsapp.com] that &quot;with end-to-end encryption, your messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and you have the special key needed to unlock and read them.&quot;.

It would be such a brazen lie that it makes me skeptical of the allegations of this lawsuit, even given my very low trust in Meta.

They claim end-to-end using signal protocol and we know that&#39;s true because the traffic can be analyzed.

Yes they can ... however WA runs on the Signal backbone.

Would be kind of braindead, to pay the fees and then torpedo out the privacy.

When E2EE was first rolled out, a message appeared in each chat saying that communications were now secure. I always wondered how they managed to distribute the keys without Facebook ever gaining access to them. I long suspected that they might secretly keep a copy of the keys, perhaps obtained during the key distribution process itself. Now those suspicions are gone

You generate the keys on the device.Obviously, you can make the app malicious, and just sent the key(s) to the mothership anyway.

However the principle is to generate the key pair on the device and sent the public one home and to communication partners.

It gets a bit more tricky, when you have multiple devices that need to have the same private key. But it is not complicated.

you can read how XMPP usage of the signal protocol deals with this: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xe... [xmpp.org]

Any supposedly secure attachment you send to your colleague will be openly stored on their phone in a place where they don&#39;t know what exists and will not likely be able to delete it

Whatsapp by default backs up unencrypted to Google/ Apple.  So Google / Apple can share with the likes of law enforcement.

Beyond this, it would surprise me if certain spy agencies didn&#39;t have a mass surveillance backdoor.  The only question is how widespread it is and how that data is being used.  For the special cases, you could hack the whole phone / compute instead of just whatsapp.

I&#39;ve not bothered to read the actual lawsuit, but most likely Whatsapp really is fully end-to-end encrypted. So if the lawsuit is asserting what the summary says, it will fail.

However, if Meta really can read messages, then they have copies of all the private client-side keys stored on their own systems, thus they can decrypt any message they want (and potentially be hacked and expose all the keys as well).

In other words the communications are protected against any man-in-the-middle, except Meta that is.

It&#39;s weird to see a global espionage saga and say, &quot;well that&#39;s dumb. I am not a wizard with nation state resources, but I could so that on a casual weekend.&quot; Their security sucks so much that my grandson could probably accidentally do that while settling up a game server.

Dumb?  That&#39;s being polite!  BJ&#39;s phone number was on a web site for 15 years: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-... [bbc.co.uk]

Lots of weird things, however the weirdest is that this comes out just immediately after, not before, they approve a huge new Chinese embassy. Likely it&#39;s been held up as a secret deliberately to not interfere with the process?

Or right before his trip to China...some people fail to see the obvious. It&#39;s all political sabotage by sinophobes.

yes, it does, and the Chinese, North Koreans, Elbonians or aliens from the planet Zod shouldn&#39;t have been able to listen in. BUT of the named politicians, they all have a secret weapon - they *speak* in code. It&#39;s a code so complex that only very few can decypher is, and there&#39;s no way the Chinese can.

Boris: We&#39;re going to, er, well, er, put it mildly, er, well, herd immunity, er, I&#39;ll do a speech on television, er, rectumChinese code breaker: Sorry boss, I have no idea

I expect China is figuring out they don&#39;t need to do much anymore to destroy the west. We do it to ourselves.

The difference is the western countries admit when they get hacked.  (Not sure if the US still counts - will find out in 2028).

China?  Russia?  Iraq?  If someone is lucky, they just fire the General responsible for security.  If not lucky, they fall out of a forty story building.  And the press says it was an accident.

But they never admit what happened - because they are terrified of letting the common folk find out how bad they are at their job.

Yup, GCHQ doesnt have a massive budget for no reason.  The NSA doesnt put its huge budget into a savings account for a rainy day.  The CIA cant even operate on US soil...

If China is doing this and getting away with it, my issue is not with China but with my countries intelligence services not countering it properly.

As a Five Eyes (FVEY) member, there are security implications for the US and other members. So it&#39;s not some trivial matter to ignore.

Given how Trump is behaving towards the UK (tarifs) and Canada (tarifs and 51st state comments) right now I suspect that alliance might well be fraying at the edges anyway.

When you say Canada will be the 51st state then it&#39;s a joke.  When the president says it, its a threat.  Especially if he starts killing people inside the country and out at random.  Especially when he says &quot;no really, I&#39;m serious about attacking Greenland&quot;.  The job of President is a serious matter.  He is not there to be a comedian.  His words have a direct effect on everything.  I wish Americans would understand to take the vote seriously.

...i wonder how they can tell that it isn&#39;t the cia doing it...Marble Framework, part of Vault 7...

End result China&#39;s IQ reduces by 10 points listening to limey blabber.

Never trust anyone with the self-aggrandising job title &#39;Chief Mouser&#39;.

They&#39;ve likely been feeding the Chinese bogus crap for years knowing the phones were being tapped.

And Liz &quot;Bested by head of lettuce&quot; Truss.

You do realise they&#39;re not directly responsible for the security apparatus, right?

You think all their WhatsApping was approved and monitored and correctly secured?  Or in US terms, use of Signal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

And as someone who decades ago had a generic clearance, I&#39;m disgusted. Back then even a peon like me was told repeatedly what you could and could not do. And they always reminded us at the time it was an offence that had the death penalty on the tab

You know it will be run by Fujitsu, Capita, or Palantir, so of course their private data will be safe and secure, if over budget by an order of magnitude.

What about them? Any different from a tesla, except that they are better and cheaper?

https://militarnyi.com/en/news... [militarnyi.com]

Tesla also collects all kinds of data, and despite their &quot;opt-out&quot; claims, you can&#39;t fully opt out except by disabling their networking with an axe.

One of these companies is friendly with the PLA and the other isn&#39;t.  That&#39;s the difference.

One of these companies is friendly with the PLA, the other is friendly with the trumpistani terrorist state.

What is a &quot;most honourable order of the bath&quot;? I assume it isn&#39;t something given you in the Hogwash school of magic.

In 2014, a couple of months after he stepped down as Director of Public Prosecutions (and more than a year before he became an MP).

Sure makes you wonder why the UK has approved that sketchy new embassy China wants to build, complete with underground rooms a few meters away from comm lines:

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ne... [telegraph.co.uk]

Looking at it the other way - those tunnels make it easy for us to spy on them.

Spy on them doing what? Tapping data cables? Surely they&#39;re aware of the risks they&#39;re taking (or not taking, as the case may be).  Embassies are already hotspots for espionage.  They&#39;re not going to risk anything more than is necessary.

They&#39;re not building those rooms in the basement just to fill them with ping pong tables and a creche.

So as an actual Brit and one who isn&#39;t fucking mental.....

Basically the Chinese Embassy as it is now isn&#39;t actually in one building but spread over several buildings all of which are very old and for which plans are not available and they all have basements, the sizes of which are unknown. So our intelligence services have a bit of a clue of the layouts above ground, after all they can just go look at the house next door, but not of what&#39;s underground. Which kind of makes it a bit hard to keep an eye on wha

Did they finally actually approve it?  AFAIK the sale was approved (which was CRAZY dumb) but since then the UK has come to their senses and basically used local-city-council nonsense to stall any approvals needed.  Or?

Always good to have your take on virtually every story these days cut and pasted some cretinous poster who thinks they&#39;re being clever.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents have now killed two U.S. citizens in Minnesota under the made-up banner of “absolute immunity” for federal law enforcement officials, regardless of what they do or how they do it. The notion of immunity for state actors in American law goes back decades, and much of what we are seeing on the ground now in terms of violent immigration enforcement has its antecedents in long-standing and deeply flawed American ideas about good guys versus bad guys and who bears the burden of law enforcement run amok. On this week’s Amicus podcast, as the nation struggles to process the executions of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation and Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: ICE agents, like all federal agents, are protected by qualified immunity, and that protects them from lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of duty. And we’ve had that for a long time. Help us understand this foundational idea that for the most part, law enforcement officers cannot be held liable for their actions when they violate your rights. How did we get here?

Alex Reinert: Really, there are two foundational ideas in play in these cases involving federal officials. One is what I’m about to talk about, which is qualified immunity, and a second is something called Bivens doctrine, which is a common law doctrine that used to allow people to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. Let’s start with qualified immunity, which is not long-standing in the sense that it’s really a modern introduction to the law of constitutional torts. It was introduced by the Supreme Court in 1967 in the context of a Freedom Riders case. That was the context in which a lawsuit was brought against state and local officials, and the Supreme Court basically said: We think, even though Congress didn’t spell it out in detail in a statute that gave you the right to sue these officials, and even though Congress didn’t say anything about an immunity doctrine, we think this common law doctrine that may have existed in 1871 should be incorporated into our constitutional tort regime. Fast-forward to 1982, which is where we got a case called Harlow v. Fitzgerald. In that case the Supreme Court said: We also think there should be an immunity doctrine that applies to federal officials.

What it means in practice is that any officer—whether state, local, or federal—who violates the Constitution won’t be held liable unless there is some prior case that makes it clear, from a court’s perspective, that the officer’s conduct was obviously a violation of the Constitution.

So qualified immunity is only really used, or it really only has an impact, when an officer is violating the Constitution. If officers don’t violate the Constitution, they don’t need the protection of qualified immunity. It’s only when officers violate the Constitution that they are able to obtain the protection of qualified immunity.

On its face, if you explained it to somebody and said that we should only hold officers liable when they were on reasonable notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct, people might look at it and think that makes sense. In practice, it has been applied in the widest range of circumstances where most people would say: How is it possible? How is it possible that somebody could get immunity when, for instance, they’re ordered by their supervisor not to fire a shot and they fire six shots and kill someone? When they are executing a search warrant and they decide to steal about $200,000 worth of valuables and a court says, Well, there’s qualified immunity because there wasn’t a prior case in point saying that when you’re executing a search warrant, you can’t steal money? Those are the kinds of cases in which qualified immunity comes into play.

It’s probably shocking to the ordinary person that in this country, a country purported to be governed by the rule of law, and where the Constitution is thought of as foundational, it turns out that violations of the Constitution by our highest-level officers and officials aren’t remediable because of this doctrine of qualified immunity.

Explain Bivens doctrine now, to set the table for what follows.

This is the other part of what is a perverse design of our constitutional scheme. Bivens is special because it applies only to federal officials. When state and local officials violate our rights, there’s a statute that goes all the way back to Reconstruction enacted in 1871 that allows us to sue state and local officials for violations of our constitutional rights. Qualified immunity still applies, but at least there’s a right to sue. There is no similar statute when federal officials violate the Constitution.

In 1971, in a case by the name of Bivens, the Supreme Court said: We think that we are going to find a right to sue in the Fourth Amendment, for Fourth Amendment violations when federal officials violate someone’s rights. Over the course of the next 10 years, the Supreme Court expanded that doctrine to include Eighth Amendment violations, and claims for sex discrimination. During the 1970s, lower courts were also rapidly expanding the Bivens doctrine.

All that changed in 1980. From 1980 on, the Supreme Court said: We are not going to entertain Bivens actions. And the court has given us a variety of reasons to the point where today, when the Supreme Court hears a Bivens claim, it basically says: We’re not sure that this court would even recognize the right to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. We’re certainly not going to extend that right to sue beyond the narrow category of the three cases in which the Bivens right was recognized in the 1970s. Furthermore, we’re going to confine those categories very narrowly.

I come back to this principle that we have a Constitution that is supposed to be meaningful in this country and it’s supposed to govern the conduct of all of our officers. It’s perverse that we have a federal Constitution that means less for federal officials than it does for state and local officials. We have a federal Constitution that is harder to enforce against federal officials than almost anyone else. That’s really a product of the Bivens doctrine.

And the last piece of this that I think is really important, just historically, for people to understand is that this wasn’t the model of remediation we had in the 19th century. You could sue federal officers in the 19th century when they violated your rights. It was not a unique occurrence. It was accepted that this was a way for people to obtain remedies. It also was accepted that it was a way to test the legality of executive conduct, of the policies and conduct of federal officials. Now we live in this world in which there are so many barriers to that kind of accountability, to those tests for legality.

That’s just a bad way to design courts. We want to learn from our mistakes. We want law to be able to develop if it should. It’s also bad, obviously, for people who are bringing these kinds of claims. I also think  it’s bad for policing. We want police to do their job consistent with the Constitution. Having answers to the question of when they violate rights and when they don’t should be, and is, important to them. So we’re losing all these opportunities in these cases to develop the law in ways that I think should help everyone.

Last week the AP reported a whistleblower complaint that showed that in violation of long-standing Fourth Amendment principles, ICE is taking the position that they can just enter folks’ homes without a judicial warrant. They can just use an administrative warrant. The whistleblower complaint alleges that the secret memo outlining this policy, signed by acting deputy ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, “although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the INA, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

I think it is extremely concerning and also an untenable interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court hasn’t addressed this question, but the whole premise of the warrant requirement is that there should be some independent adjudicator—someone outside the executive branch—to decide whether or not there is a justification for invading the sanctity of someone’s home. Administrative warrants don’t provide that; judicial warrants do. That doesn’t mean judicial warrants are perfect, but they are at least outside the executive branch. It’s important from a separation-of-powers perspective, of course, and it’s important from an institutional design perspective. We already have so much about the immigration system over which the executive has so much authority: the appointment of immigration judges, all of these policy memos. So to fold the power to issue warrants, and act on warrants, into the executive in this way is just an extreme power grab. And the line about use of force gets us back to what we were talking about with Bivens and qualified immunity, which is when the officers use force in those circumstances, when they go overboard in their use of force—as inevitably some will—what kinds of remedies will there be? Those will be few and far between.

It reminds me of Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, where he says, essentially, People are talking about use of force, but this case isn’t about use of force. If there is a use of force, then people should be able to go to court and sue. He says all that in his concurrence, but at the same time we know that Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who has led the charge for undermining the Bivens remedy. It’s exactly what the Supreme Court does in so many contexts in the civil rights world. They’ll say: We’re not going to give you this remedy here, but don’t worry. There’s all these other ways you can enforce your rights. And then when they’re over there in the other box, they say: Well, we’re not going to allow you to enforce your rights here because there’s something else over here. Pam Karlan calls it a shell game and it works like this: When I’m over here, I’m going to say, Don’t worry about me limiting your rights because there’s some other way for you to enforce them. And then I’m just going to undermine your means of enforcing them in that other part of the jurisprudence. So it is troubling to the extreme that ICE officers are going to be acting on this authority.

Since 2020, and the murder of George Floyd and the flash of recognition that police reform was past due, there has been a significant public silence. As a consequence, in that silence, we have to grapple with that which makes us very uncomfortable. By “we” I mean a culture that has turned a blind eye to a lot of these issues and is suddenly startled by the ways police immunity and impunity have been weaponized for immigration enforcement. So help us think through reform in ways that are conducive to meaningful accountability and conducive to having a civic life that doesn’t include masked officers pepper-spraying or shooting somebody who’s already restrained on the ground. How do we think in a bigger, more generous way about getting to where we want to be?

I guess I would think about it in at least two different ways. The first is part of the reason there’s resistance to increasing accountability, particularly for our policing apparatus. It has to do with the sense that it’s a hard job. And it’s a job that at some level, most people think we need people to do. And what do we do when something that people see as really important, that’s also hard, what do we do when that imposes costs? When that imposes costs on people who did nothing wrong, who are left traumatized, maybe dead, seriously injured? I’ve always thought that the problem with a lot of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is it leaves those costs on the people who suffered them. It leaves those costs directly on the people who suffered them. But if we allow it, if we think there’s something good that comes out of policing, if we think it creates some value for the public at large, why should the costs be borne solely by the people who suffered most significantly as a result of it? So that’s one piece of it that always resonates with me about why some of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is so wrong.

For a while, or at least for I don’t know how long of a moment after the murder of George Floyd, there was a conversation. I would go to demonstrations and I’d see signs that said “End qualified immunity.” There was a way in which the doctrine that previously mostly lawyers knew about or scholars were talking about and mostly other people didn’t know about, that doctrine came into the public consciousness and became important. I think there is still some of that going on. I think there is still some momentum for that.

When we think about accountability, we usually think about accountability for an individual, an individual who behaved in some unlawful way. It makes sense to think about accountability that way. But the problems we’re talking about are systemic. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some individuals, the so-called bad apples, who no matter what kind of training we have, no matter what way we approach hiring, no matter what kind of supervision we provide, there are some people who may just act egregiously because they can, because they have a badge. But I think for the most part, the problems we’re talking about are systemic. And if the problems are systemic, then talking about accountability for individuals isn’t necessarily the right frame. I think we need to approach solutions to the problem systemically. And those solutions are as much about: Who ends up paying the damages for the people who suffer? Should it be the individual officer or should it be the departments that employ them? As a matter of practice, it’s always the departments who employ them. So we need to find a way for those agencies to learn better from the kinds of misconduct that their officers enter into. But it’s also about the legal regime that we set up to allow people to sue and what kinds of things they sue for, the way we allow people, really limit the ability of people, to bring so-called injunctive relief and systemic reform of departments.

So if we think about accountability more broadly, and we think about the problems we’ve been talking about, through a systemic lens, it’s not so much about the individual officer. It’s about creating a legal regime that allows us to get answers to the questions of how people were mistreated, whether the way in which they were mistreated was unlawful, and making sure that we can build systems so that it doesn’t keep happening. Because right now we’re in a world where it is happening over and over again and it seems like there are very few tools in our toolbox to prevent the reoccurrence.

Early Saturday morning, it appeared as if enough Senate Democrats were willing to fund the Department of Homeland Security and its deportation machine, if that’s what it took to keep the rest of the government open.

The House had passed funding for the DHS late last week, with seven centrist Democrats joining nearly all Republicans to get it over the line. The Senate was to take it up this week alongside a handful of other funding bills. It was expected that, as with the House vote, enough Democrats would hold their noses and support it, even if it meant absorbing blowback from a furious Democratic base that has been dusting off the largely dormant “Abolish ICE” slogan. Democratic negotiators felt that approving full-year, carefully negotiated spending bills and reasserting Congress’ power of the purse over a freewheeling executive branch was the priority of the moment.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement last Tuesday, once the deal was released. She listed some pittances she had secured in the DHS bill, such as more money for body cameras for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. She knew, though, that wouldn’t ease any anger within the base. Ultimately, she leveled.

“But the hard truth,” she added, “is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”

All of this changed on Saturday in Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents killed 37-year-old observer Alex Pretti. All of this changed when videos showed Pretti subdued, being pepper-sprayed and then shot, over and over again, without brandishing the firearm that he was permitted to carry. All of this changed when, as after the killing of Renee Good, White House adviser Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem absurdly described Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” or “assassin.” After Pretti’s killing and the administration’s eyesight-defying remorselessness over what happened, there was no way Senate Democrats could put their fingerprints on a bill to fund the administration’s deportation machine.

“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” Patty Murray said Saturday.

She was hardly the only one. Democrats who’ve previously broken from the pack to join Republicans in advancing government funding bills, like Sens. Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, Angus King, and Jacky Rosen, all said the same. On the House side, meanwhile, one Democrat who had voted for the DHS funding bill, New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, offered a mea culpa on social media, saying that he had “long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put a bow on Democrats’ new posture Saturday night: Democrats would filibuster DHS funding without changes. And it didn’t sound like there was much handwringing about it.

Does this make a partial government shutdown, after funding lapses after Jan. 30, inevitable? Let’s say much more likely. The situation is complicated for reasons including, but not limited to, the weather.

The funding bill the Senate will be voting on does not just cover DHS. It combines half a dozen bills that the House has passed in January funding everything from the Pentagon to the State Department to the departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Labor, and more. Although this package includes only half of the 12 yearly appropriations bills, the specific departments it includes—especially Defense and HHS—comprise a comfortable majority of annual spending.

Senate Democrats are calling on their Republican counterparts, in Schumer’s words, to “work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.” In other words, to strip DHS funding from the package, pass everything else, and then allow for more time to negotiate the DHS budget.

Would Republicans be willing to do this? They typically don’t take orders from Democrats. But Republican leaders, just as much as Democratic ones, don’t want appropriators’ delicate work on the biggest funding bills to get sent to an incinerator of fury. The New York Times reported Saturday that “recognizing the depth of Democratic rage,” Senate Republicans “immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said her committee was “exploring all options.”

If—if—leaders in the Senate reach an agreement to amend the package, then there’s another problem: The House is on recess this week, and House Republicans’ leaders wouldn’t be particularly enthused about summoning members to Washington to revote on a package amended at Democrats’ request. Plus, a substantial portion of the continental United States is buried under a sheet of ice and snow, conditions that aren’t conducive to travel.

It’s important to note that a lapse in DHS funding wouldn’t impede deportation operations much. As Patty Murray repeatedly said when she was trying to push the deal through, ICE is sitting on substantial funds that were made available to it in Republicans’ party-line megabill last year.

Murray is still saying that, posting on Sunday that “Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE. ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap, whether or not we pass a funding bill.”

“But,” she added, “we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight.” They’re not about to bless it with their votes.

On Saturday, Alex Pretti was pushed to the ground and fatally shot by federal agents. Video shows that, moments before, Pretti was holding a cellphone in one hand and had his other hand up. Pretti was 37 and worked as an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. He enjoyed biking and had a dog named Joule.

Later that day, What Next’s Mary Harris spoke to Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague and friend of Pretti’s, who remembers him as “a kind guy” who modeled cooperation and who, right out of school, took one of the hardest jobs available to nurses. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How did you learn about what happened?

Dimitri Drekonja: We were at [my son’s ski] race in the morning, and one of the other parents said, “Did you hear there was another shooting?” It sort of filtered through: “It sounds like another shooting.” “Another person died.” And there was a lot of sort of like, “This is just heavy.” “Awful.”

And then we got back from the race, and on a group chat, someone said, “ICE executed Alex Pretti.” [Editor’s note: It later became clear that the officers were with Customs and Border Protection.] It was from our group that we had had when we had first hired him to be study staff on our research project. It was like, What? You have to be kidding me.

I had seen one of the videos. [In it,] you can’t see the defined definitions of someone’s face and recognize them. But once the name was out there and I saw the build, the facial hair, it’s like, Oh, shit, that was Alex.

People have asked, “Are you surprised that he was protesting?” And, in all honesty, no one can be surprised that anyone in Minneapolis is protesting. We see 80-year-olds out protesting. We see kids out protesting. The city is pretty, pretty pissed off about what is happening, and people are out there doing their civic duty of being out there peacefully protesting.

Have you been able to watch the videos? I can’t stop myself watching the videos.

I don’t know how you watch someone you know—

I have not sought them out. I mean, my wife has shown me some, like, “Oh, God, with this new view you can see …” I’ve seen a few that way. It’s awful.

You posted on social media that you were feeling white-hot rage. What do you do with that feeling in this moment?

Right now, delay going to dinner with friends because I don’t feel terribly sociable. I’ve been really appreciative of people who have been reaching out to say, “Hey, sorry to hear—sounds like Alex was a great guy. This is hard.”

I think other people are enraged. I think the worst thing right now would be to have random violence. I’ve been really proud of Minneapolis—the scope and scale of the protests, the fact that they have been peaceful.

The administration has said your friend must have been trying to kill officers. Is there something you want to tell people who may have that belief about Alex?

The thing that I would say is that I have known Alex for years. I’ve known him to be a kind guy, a guy quick with a laugh, a joke, willing to help. He has never shared a conspiracy theory or shared anger at a group or been unpatriotic. I mean, he is the kind of guy that you would want as your neighbor and your friend. I would be thrilled if he were to move into the house next door.

We have a shared interest in mountain biking. We were planning on going out together. I was always the one who was having to say, “No, sorry, my kid has a race this week. Can’t do it.” But we liked the same trail systems, and we talked about riding them.

I have observed him clinically. He is fabulous, he gives great assessments, he’s enthusiastic, he is smart, and I will just say that anybody going into the ICU fresh out of nursing school—you’re gonna deal with very sick patients. A [large] percent of the patients in the ICU will die, and you’ll have to deal with grieving, upset families. You’ll have to use all your skills to try to keep that person alive. To do that right out of nursing school is impressive.

Sometimes medicine is a hierarchical place. He was not like that, and I loved that. I would run into him, and he would say, “Hey, Dimitri, how’s it going? It’s good to see you again.” I love that he had that informal relationship. I love it was modeled for trainees who worked with us. Like, yeah, this is how you do it: You’re colleagues, you’re friendly, you are nice to each other, and you work well together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US spending watchdogs have called on the National Weather Service (NWS) to deliver an updated plan for its AI language translation project to reduce the risk posed by extreme weather events to people not proficient in English.

The call from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) comes as vast swathes of the US are pinned down by a winter storm that has already claimed lives.

But the NWS AI translation effort has been caught between a drive to reach as many people as possible, administration changes, and a White House Executive order to cement the role of English as the country&#39;s official language.

The GAO report [PDF] noted that 26 million people in the US have &quot;limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English.&quot; Two-thirds of people with limited English speak Spanish, while other major languages include Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. French rounds out the top ten.

If they can&#39;t understand the NWS&#39;s emergency weather messages sent to mobile phones or via radio and TV, this can lead to deaths and injuries, economic effects, and &quot;confusion,&quot; for example, during evacuation efforts.

Text alerts, or WEAs, are already distributed in Spanish, while the Emergency Alert System (EAS) over radio and TV is English-only. Most other non-alert messaging is English-only too.

There are FCC requirements to support additional languages for WEAs by June 2028. At the same time, Executive Order 14224, signed on March 1, 2025, designated English as the official language of the US. This has caused uncertainty over exactly how far the NWS should go in extending its translated alerts.

It has also created uncertainty around the NWS experiments in using AI to provide translations of alerts.

This started in 2021, with &quot;translated products on a public website since October 2023,&quot; the report said. It added that as of December 2025, AI was used to &quot;translate selected products issued by about a quarter of its weather forecast offices and the National Hurricane Center into five languages.&quot;

The GAO said the NWS had contracted with a commercial vendor to develop its translation systems, &quot;and relies on internal bilingual NWS staff to help train the AI models.&quot; From 2022 to last year, it spent about $2.7 million on the project, which covered five languages.

Training models for a new language took about three months, with NWS bilingual staff and contractors reviewing translations. Once up and running, the &quot;translation process generally takes about one minute and is integrated into the system that forecasters use to generate weather products.&quot;

But the program was briefly paused as of March 2025 due to the need for department-level approval of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contracts for more than $100,000.

A new deal was subsequently signed, but at a lower level, meaning plans to support further languages are on ice until at least April 2026. The report says that officials did not seek further funds for the AI project in 2026 as they were awaiting guidance on the implementation of the executive order.

The GAO said the AI program could extend the accessibility of &quot;weather products&quot; and reduce risks to public health and safety during extreme weather events.

But the watchdog said the NWS &quot;could better manage the project by establishing and communicating measurable performance goals, resource needs, and strategies to address internal and external challenges.&quot;

It called for an updated implementation plan to help &quot;NWS use its existing resources to support the highest priority activities, realistically plan for the future of the project, and communicate resource needs to Congress.&quot;

But the agency also highlighted the need for human input too as literal translations do not always capture nuance. For example, a brochure on rip tide safety &quot;used corrientes de resaca for rip current, which for certain Spanish speakers translates to &#39;hangover current.&#39;&quot; ®

            <h2>NASA begins formal anomaly review after MAVEN probe lost in space</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/nasa_anomaly_review_maven/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is setting up an anomaly review board to look into the fate of its Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, which was last heard from on December 6.

Attempts to make contact with the Mars orbiter are ongoing. The final fragments of data indicated that the spacecraft was tumbling and had possibly changed trajectory. The MAVEN team is analyzing snippets of data recovered from a December 6 radio science campaign to develop a timeline of possible events and likely root causes of the issue.

James Godfrey, retired Spacecraft Operations Manager for ESA&#39;s Mars Express, pondered what might have happened to MAVEN in a message to The Register.

&quot;The fact that it appears to be rotating in an unexpected manner (tumbling?) and might have experienced an orbital change (I guess from inconsistent Doppler data) does suggest an energetic event.

&quot;It&#39;s unlikely that anything has hit it – not much space debris at Mars. So more likely something onboard.&quot;

If the spacecraft had entered a normal safe mode, controllers should have been able to communicate with it. &quot;So whatever has happened, it hasn&#39;t been able to reach safe mode for some unknown reason,&quot; Godfrey speculated.

&quot;So problems that could result in loss of attitude, possible orbit change, would suggest problems affecting GNC [Guidance, Navigation, and Control]. Could be an onboard computer failure, stuck valve, run out of fuel etc. Possibly a problem with the reaction wheels? In any case, something that caused the thrusters to fire in an unbalanced fashion from which the spacecraft was unable to recover autonomously.&quot;

All possibilities are bad news for MAVEN, both as a mission and a telecommunications relay for NASA&#39;s Mars rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance. The spacecraft entered Mars orbit on September 22, 2014, with a two-year planned mission. It has since endured for well over a decade, gathering data on the planet&#39;s atmosphere.

Attempts to contact the probe were further complicated by the solar conjunction, when the Sun lies between the Earth and Mars, blocking communication.

Godfrey noted this was &quot;a more challenging conjunction than the run-of-the-mill&quot; and the fact &quot;the Sun being very active at the moment won&#39;t help.&quot;

All of which makes MAVEN&#39;s recovery at this stage improbable. The thermal and power status of the spacecraft is not known, nor is its location.

The assembly of a formal anomaly review board is an indicator that, while NASA has yet to throw in the towel, things are not looking good for MAVEN, and managers want to understand what happened. ®

            <h2>France to replace US videoconferencing wares with unfortunately named sovereign alternative</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/france_videoconferencing_visio/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">France has officially told Zoom, Teams, and the rest of the US videoconferencing herd to take a hike in favor of its own homegrown app.

The plan, announced on Monday, is to shove US videoconferencing tools out of the French public sector altogether, with Zoom, Teams, Webex, and Google Meet making way for a state-built alternative that Paris says keeps its data, infrastructure, and legal exposure firmly at home.

The platform, called Visio, is being developed and rolled out by the government&#39;s Interministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs (DINUM) and is set to become the default, and eventually exclusive, video meeting tool for public servants.

The announcement was made by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance as part of France&#39;s broader push for digital sovereignty. The government says that using foreign videoconferencing platforms exposes official communications to overseas infrastructure, laws, and political pressures it would rather avoid.

&quot;This project is a concrete illustration of the Prime Minister and the Government&#39;s commitment to regaining our digital independence,&quot; said David Amiel, minister delegate for the Civil Service and State Reform. &quot;We cannot risk having our scientific exchanges, our sensitive data, and our strategic innovations exposed to non-European actors. Digital sovereignty is simultaneously an imperative for our public services, an opportunity for our businesses, and insurance against future threats.&quot;

According to the announcement, Visio has already been tested by tens of thousands of civil servants and is now being scaled up for wider use across ministries, agencies, and public bodies. The plan is for Visio to be in routine use across the state by 2027, after which external videoconferencing licenses would no longer be renewed. Large parts of the public sector, including tax and social security bodies, have already started the switch.

Security is the main sales pitch, with Paris stressing that Visio runs on infrastructure it controls and is built to comply with French and EU data protection and confidentiality rules. There&#39;s money in it as well, at least on paper: Paris estimates that moving 100,000 users off commercial platforms saves around €1 million a year in license fees.

France is also keen to stress that Visio is not meant to be a bare-bones substitute. The platform will, eventually at least, boast transcription and live captions, but without shipping the audio off to someone else&#39;s cloud. The subtext is less about convenience and more about avoiding US jurisdiction over data.

However, there is one small but telling irony lurking in the announcement. Calling a state videoconferencing platform &quot;Visio&quot; all but guarantees confusion with Microsoft&#39;s long-established diagramming software of the same name, suggesting that, while France is moving to cut US dependencies, it may not have spent quite as much time on branding.

Whether Visio sticks or joins the long list of state IT projects that never quite replace the tools people actually like will only become clear over time. For now, though, France has made its position clear: when it comes to official video calls, Uncle Sam is no longer invited. ®

            <h2>Succession: Linux kernel community gets continuity plan for post-Linus era</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/linux_continuity_plan/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Linux kernel project has finally answered one of the biggest questions gripping the community: what happens if Linus Torvalds is no longer able to lead it?

The &quot;Linux project continuity document,&quot; drafted by Dan Williams, was merged into its documentation last week, just ahead of the release of Linux 6.19-rc7. Notably, the document&#39;s path is Documentation/process/conclave.rst.

It notes that the kernel development project is &quot;widely distributed, with over 100 maintainers each working to keep changes moving through their own repositories.&quot;

But &quot;the final step... is a centralized one where changes are pulled into the mainline repository.&quot; And that is &quot;normally done by Linus Torvalds,&quot; though &quot;there are others who can do that work when the need arises.&quot;

It delicately adds: &quot;Should the maintainers of that repository become unwilling or unable to do that work going forward (including facilitating a transition), the project will need to find one or more replacements without delay.&quot;

So what will happen? The process centers on &quot;$ORGANIZER&quot; who is &quot;the last Maintainer Summit organizer or the current Linux Foundation (LF) Technical Advisory Board (TAB) Chair as a backup.&quot;

The document says: &quot;Within 72 hours, $ORGANIZER will open a discussion with the invitees of the most recently concluded Maintainers Summit. A meeting of those invitees and the TAB, either online or in-person, will be set as soon as possible in a way that maximizes the number of people who can participate.&quot;

In the event of no summit happening in the previous 15 months, the TAB will choose the attendees. Invitees can bring in other maintainers as needed. The meeting will be chaired by $ORGANIZER and will &quot;consider options for the ongoing management of the top-level kernel repository consistent with the expectation that it maximizes the long term health of the project and its community.&quot;

&quot;Next steps&quot; will then be communicated to the broader community through the ksummit@lists.linux.dev mailing list. The Linux Foundation, with guidance from the TAB, will &quot;take the steps necessary to support and implement this plan.&quot;

The document follows discussion of succession and continuity at the 2025 Maintainers Summit. This included what would happen during a &quot;smooth transition&quot; if Torvalds decides it is time to move on, as well as the process &quot;should something happen.&quot;

While Torvalds has a firm grip on Linux, as the continuity plan notes, he has himself mused on his own future and the fact the maintainer community, at least for the kernel, is getting grayer.

At the Open Source Summit in 2024, he noted: &quot;Some people are probably still disappointed that I&#39;m still here. I mean, it is absolutely true that kernel maintainers are aging.&quot;

He was asked by fellow pioneer Dirk Hohndel of Verizon what the community needs to do to ensure the next generation is ready, &quot;so that in 10, 15, 20, 30 years your role can be handed off to someone else.&quot;

Torvalds replied: &quot;We&#39;ve always had a lot of people who are very competent and could step up.&quot; As for an aging community, he said new people still come in and become main developers within three years. &quot;It&#39;s not impossible at all.&quot;

And Torvalds is not the only maintainer making plans as the open source community matures. Some projects have, of course, fallen by the wayside over the years. Some remain embedded in the ecosystem, even as their originators and maintainers get older.

One option is handing them over to a foundation. Others like curl originator Daniel Stenberg have remained fiercely independent – with discreet arrangements to pass on their GitHub details when the time comes. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Japan&#39;s RIKEN scientific research institute and Fujitsu are working with America&#39;s Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Nvidia to build and operate next-gen compute infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), in line with President Trump&#39;s Genesis Mission.

RIKEN says the four organizations have agreed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop system software and applications for science and engineering purposes, and promote the use of AI for scientific research.

Areas where the group is expected to cooperate include future computing architectures, where they&#39;ll jointly define and prototype next-gen tech for typical HPC workloads such as modeling and simulation, but also the integration of AI into these workflows.

RIKEN claims the participants hope to develop a shared software ecosystem, in the form of an open and interoperable software stack to support AI-enabled scientific discoveries.

In addition, the organizations will team up to develop autonomous laboratory workflows to advance the integration of AI and physical science, as well as the convergence of quantum computing and supercomputing.

&quot;RIKEN will lead global efforts in advancing sophisticated use of AI technologies for scientific research through this four-party agreement within the framework of Japan-US cooperation aligned with the US Department of Energy&#39;s (DOE) Genesis Mission,&quot; said the research institute&#39;s President Makoto Gonokami.

Unveiled last year, Genesis was pitched by the Trump administration as a national effort to develop and use AI for scientific discoveries.

So it seems Tokyo is not too worried about aligning itself with Washington on science and technology, while governments and businesses in Europe are growing increasingly concerned about their own reliance on US tech giants for cloud services and other areas of compute.

&quot;This collaboration represents a pivotal step forward in harnessing the transformative potential of AI and high-performance computing to address pressing scientific challenges in energy, national security, and fundamental research,&quot; said Argonne&#39;s Laboratory Director Paul Kearns.

&quot;Together we&#39;re building a foundation for next-generation computing architectures and AI-driven scientific discovery that advances the Genesis Mission goals.&quot;

This isn&#39;t the first MoU between RIKEN and ANL. The two research bodies signed another on AI for scientific research in 2024.

RIKEN is already working with Fujitsu and Nvidia on the successor to Japan&#39;s Fugaku supercomputer, formerly the most powerful computer in the world until the introduction of the first exascale systems.

Codenamed &quot;FugakuNEXT,&quot; this will be another system built with processors based on Arm cores, with Fujitsu winning the contract to develop it last year. Soon after, the Japanese tech corporation signed a deal with Nvidia to supply GPU accelerators and help design the hardware to incorporate them into the supercomputer. ®

            <div id="article-text">Updated Microsoft illegally installed cookies on a school pupil&#39;s devices without consent, according to a ruling by the Austrian data protection authority (DSB).

In the second ruling [PDF], won by Austria-based campaign group None of Your Business (noyb), the authority found that Microsoft acted unlawfully when it placed tracking cookies on the devices of a minor using Microsoft 365 Education.

Microsoft&#39;s own documentation says these cookies analyze user behavior, collect browser data, and are used for advertising. The DSB has also said the US software firm should stop tracking the complainant – whose identity was not disclosed – within four weeks. Both the school and the Austrian Ministry of Education claimed they were not aware of the tracking cookies before noyb raised the complaints.

Microsoft now has four weeks to comply and cease the use of tracking cookies on the devices of the minor. The Register has asked Microsoft to comment.

In a statement, Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at noyb, said: &quot;Tracking minors clearly isn&#39;t privacy-friendly. It seems like Microsoft doesn&#39;t care much about privacy, unless it is for their marketing and PR statements.&quot;

In 2024, noyb asked the Austrian data protection authority to investigate Microsoft 365 Education to clarify if it breaches transparency provisions under GDPR. It said the tech giant pushed data protection obligations onto schools that use the system, and failed to comply with subjects&#39; right to access data about them. Neither Microsoft&#39;s privacy documentation, requests for access, nor noyb&#39;s research could fully clarify what data about children is being processed by Microsoft 365 Education.

The complaint dates back to the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools rapidly shifted to online learning, using the likes of Microsoft&#39;s 365 Education as well as Google&#39;s Workspace for Education and others.

In October last year, the Austrian digital privacy group claimed its first victory in the case, after the DSB ruled Microsoft had &quot;illegally&quot; tracked students via its 365 Education platform and tried to shift responsibility for access requests to local schools.

The authority ordered the software giant to provide complete information about the data transmitted, and to provide clear explanations of what was meant by terms such as &quot;internal reporting,&quot; &quot;business modeling,&quot; and &quot;improvement of core functionality.&quot; ®

A Microsoft spokesperson told The Register: &quot;Microsoft 365 for Education meets all required data protection standards and institutions in the education sector can continue to use it in compliance with GDPR. We are reviewing the Austrian data protection authority&#39;s latest decision and will decide on next steps in due course.&quot;

Seven Virtual Boy games will launch on February 17th, with additional titles coming later this year.﻿

Following the initial reveal last September, Nintendo has released a new trailer detailing which Virtual Boy games will be available to Switch Online subscribers starting on February 17th alongside revamped headsets, and which titles will launch later this year. The company also revealed some new features for the games, including the option to change the color of Virtual Boy titles which were notoriously limited to only bright red on the original hardware.

Both the $99.99 Virtual Boy headset accessory and the $24.99 cardboard version require a Switch or Switch 2 console to be inserted in order to play Virtual Boy games. The lineup of games launching alongside the accessories on February 17th include Teleroboxer, Galactic Pinball, Red Alarm, Golf, Virtual Boy Wario Land, 3-D Tetris, and The Mansion of Innsmouth.

Virtual Boy titles coming later in 2026 include Mario Clash, Mario’s Tennis, Jack Bros., Space Invaders Virtual Collection, Virtual Bowling, Vertical Force, and V-Tetris. Nintendo Switch Online will also feature two previously unreleased Virtual Boy games “coming later this year.” Zero Racers, and D-Hopper.

Players will be able to rewind and replay Virtual Boy games through the Switch Online service and remap controls. That’s especially useful as neither headset accessory includes the original Virtual Boy’s unique controller which featured a pair of D-pads. However, as welcome as the color changing feature will be when it also launches later this year, it will only be available for the more expensive Virtual Boy headset accessory and will require you to remove its lens cover first.

Elon Musk’s company is giving us a preview of the price wars coming to the robotaxi industry.

Tesla’s robotaxis are not robotaxis in the sense that they’re not fully driverless and still feature safety monitors with access to a kill switch in case anything goes wrong. But the automaker is shaking things up with its approach to pricing, according to a new analysis of the nascent market.

Obi, an app that aggregates real-time pricing and pickup times for multiple ridehailing services, published a sequel to its report from last year that analyzed Waymo’s prices and rider satisfaction compared to traditional ridehail services like Uber and Lyft. The new report now factors in Tesla’s service, since the previous survey represented data prior to Elon Musk’s entry into the market.

The report is based on over a month of data collected between November 27th, 2025, and January 1st, 2026. A total of 94,348 rides from Waymo, Tesla, Uber, and Lyft were included as part of the dataset.

In its analysis, Obi found that Tesla’s robotaxis are significantly less expensive than Waymo, and even Uber and Lyft — but also have some of the longest wait times in the industry. Tesla’s robotaxis were so cheap that it recalled the early days of Uber, when the ridehail company used venture capital cash to significantly undercut legacy taxi operations with dirt-cheap UberX prices.

The average price of a Tesla robotaxi ride in San Francisco was $8.17, and rarely exceeded $10 per trip, according to Obi’s analysis. That’s way cheaper than the next cheapest option, Lyft, which averages $15.47 per ride. Tesla was averaging $1.99 per kilometer, the lowest figure of that category that Obi had ever seen in its reporting. Compare that to Waymo’s $5.72 per kilometer, and you start to get the picture of how Tesla could shape the competitive landscape.

Speaking of Waymo, the robotaxi pioneer is getting more affordable. Back in June, Obi reported that Waymo’s robotaxi rides were on average 30–40 percent more expensive than Uber and Lyft. But now the gap is narrowing, both because Waymo has been dropping its own prices but also because Uber’s and Lyft’s prices are rising. Waymo is now an average of 12.7 percent more expensive than Uber and 27.3 percent more expensive than Lyft. For longer rides between 4.3–9.3 kilometers, Waymo is only 2 percent more expensive than Uber and 17 percent more expensive than Lyft on a per-kilometer basis.

Of course, there are a number of caveats to get out of the way before you can start making apples-to-apples comparisons between Tesla and Waymo. For example, Tesla only operates a handful of vehicles in San Francisco and Austin, while Waymo says it has around 2,000–2,500 across five US cities. As of December 2025, Waymo says it’s providing 450,000 paid trips each week. Tesla lacks the necessary permits to begin driverless operations in California, and has only just started testing fully driverless vehicles in Texas, albeit with chase cars. And there are multiple experts who have raised doubts as to whether Tesla will ever achieve full autonomy with its current hardware.

Still, Tesla’s dirt-cheap robotaxi prices are a sign of the fierce competition that is surely coming for the robotaxi market. The company’s willingness to aggressively subsidize its service in the hopes of grabbing market share from its competitors is noteworthy, but also begs the question: How long can Tesla keep this up? The fact that the company is pricing its service this low at the onset, even before removing safety monitors from its vehicles, may strike some as putting the cart before the driverless horse. But time will tell how committed Tesla is to this pricing structure.

You may not have to pay much for a Tesla robotaxi ride, but patience is definitely a requirement. The company’s robotaxi service in San Francisco features by far the longest wait times, with an average ETA of 15.32 minutes — “considerably higher” than Waymo, Uber, and Lyft, Obi says.

Meanwhile, Waymo’s average ETA is 5.74 minutes. And outside of a peak demand time in the afternoon when Waymo ETAs are significantly longer, the Alphabet company’s wait times are frequently shorter than Uber’s and are getting closer to Lyft’s at many times of the day, Obi says.

As for consumer demand, Obi surveyed 2,000 people from California, Nevada, Texas, and Arizona to find out how they were feeling about these new robots. Enthusiasm is growing, with the survey showing a significant increase in comfort levels riding in an robotaxi compared to the last survey — up from 35 percent to 63 percent.

People aren’t thrilled by the high costs, with 45 percent of respondents citing it as a concern. Other points of dissatisfaction are long wait times (33 percent), cancellations (29 percent), and lack of competition (24 percent). But confidence in the technology is trending high. More than half of respondents believe robotaxis will be safer than human-driven rides within five years, signaling growing trust despite some recent high-profile headlines. Still, safety remains a sticking point, with over 50 percent of respondents citing it as a persistent worry and 47 percent saying they’re concerned about possible failures.

Obi says it hopes to include Zoox, which recently launched a free robotaxi service in San Francisco, in its next analysis.

It’s somewhere between 10 blue links and a full-blown AI assistant, and so far, it feels like the right mix.

Yahoo’s big AI play is, in many ways, actually a return to the company’s roots. Three decades ago, Yahoo was known as “Jerry’s guide to the world wide web,” and was designed as a sort of all-encompassing portal to help people find good stuff on an increasingly large, hard-to-parse internet. In the early aughts, the rise of web search more or less obviated that whole idea. But now, Yahoo thinks, we’ve come back around.

With a new product called Scout, Yahoo is trying to return to being that kind of guide to the web — only this time, with a whole bunch of AI in the mix. Scout, in its early form, is a search portal that will immediately be familiar if you’ve ever used Perplexity or clicked over to Google’s AI Mode. It shows a text box and some suggested queries. You type a question; it delivers an answer. Right now Scout is a tab in Yahoo’s search engine (which, CEO Jim Lanzone likes to remind me every time we talk, is somehow still the third-most-popular search engine in the US), a standalone web app, and a central feature in the new Yahoo Search mobile app. Yahoo calls it an “answer engine,” but it’s AI web search. You get it. And so far, it’s the most search-y of any similar product I’ve tried. I like it a lot.

Scout has two jobs, really. The first is just to be a guide, to find stuff on the web. “It’s moved from ‘how do I find things on the internet’ to weeding through clickbait and now AI slop,” says Eric Feng, who runs Yahoo’s research group and has been leading the Scout project. But Scout’s job is also to bring AI summaries and smarts to all of Yahoo’s other products, and to help Yahoo users pull all that disparate data into one place.

In a funny twist, Yahoo may be perfectly positioned to do this well. Because Yahoo runs huge content verticals like Sports and Finance, with a big newsroom of its own and partnerships with many other publishers, it has a huge amount of high-quality reference material for Scout. It also has Yahoo Weather and Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Horoscopes and Yahoo Shopping and Yahoo So Many Other Things Besides. Yahoo is a full-fledged content machine, and it can just point an LLM at all that content. “We’re the only ones who can take our user data, our usage data, our content, our relationships and information, and combine that with everything we know about search into an AI answer engine,” Lanzone says.

Google would probably take issue with that statement. It has many of Yahoo’s same advantages, and a bunch of other ones, and a lot more users. But Yahoo has one key win over Google: It doesn’t have a massive, indomitable search-ads business to protect. Because of the sheer scale of both its user base and its revenue, Google has to slow-play its way into making AI Mode the face of Google Search, even though that’s obviously the plan. Yahoo has no such qualms: Lanzone says Scout won’t replace standard Yahoo Search from day one, but makes it pretty clear that that’s the plan before long.

There is still a business plan here, though. Scout is launching with affiliate links for shopping results and an ad unit at the bottom of some searches. All the AI search products seem to be deciding that ads are the way to monetize AI, and Yahoo is set up to get there quickly. The goal, Lanzone says, is to use ads to keep Scout free for everyone. “Maybe one day we’ll also have a paid tier,” he adds, “but free search is extremely important.”

One thing Yahoo isn’t doing? Building its own foundation model. For one thing, Lanzone says, doing that is very expensive. “We think we can best serve our users not so much with the model,” he says, “but with the grounding data and the personalization data that we can add on top of other people’s models.” Scout is based on Anthropic’s Claude model, and what Feng describes as “Yahoo content, Yahoo data, Yahoo personality.” Much of the web-search data comes from a partnership with Microsoft and Bing, as it has for many years.

Everybody doing AI search swears they care deeply about the future of the open web, but in my testing so far, Scout is the most web-forward AI search product yet. When I asked Scout, “What’s the latest on this winter storm?” it responded with a one-paragraph summary that included three links prominently highlighted in blue. After that, I got three sections of more details about what’s happening in my Virginia town, the forecast to come, and then a “Latest News” section with links to Yahoo stories, Yahoo partner stories, and other links around the web. In total, the page had nine links, plus a way to see all the page’s sources at once.

When I did the same search on ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Mode, I got similar summaries, structured in similar ways. ChatGPT was the only one to link more prominently: It stuck a carousel of news links right at the top of the page. Other than that, all three platforms seem to hide links behind icons or light-colored buttons — only Scout seems to actually want you to click the links. Making sure people actually do click them will be crucial to the rest of Yahoo’s business, and to keeping its newsroom and publisher partners on board with Scout’s existence.

In my early tests of Scout, it feels much more like a search engine than an AI companion. Its tone is very straightforward, and it doesn’t present like a friend to talk to. It’s just a way to find information on the internet, organized conversationally rather than as a bunch of links. That doesn’t sound particularly novel, but in a sea of AI tools that would love to pretend the internet doesn’t exist at all, it’s a refreshingly useful take on the genre. I don’t think I’ve used Yahoo Search on purpose in a decade, but when I wanted to know when the Winter Olympics started, Scout gave me a better answer than any other search engine I tested. That’s not enough to take on Google, but it’s a decent start.

The settlement includes $600 million in refunds and an additional $309.5 million in payments to impacted customers.

Amazon is resolving claims that it incorrectly processed returns with a proposed settlement valued at over $1 billion, as reported earlier by Reuters and Bloomberg Law. The settlement includes $600 million in refunds, along with an additional $309.5 million in payments to affected customers.

Initially filed in 2023, the class action lawsuit claims that while Amazon advertises “free, no hassle returns,” it often “fails to issue refunds or re-charges customers who have returned items.” It also alleges that Amazon knows customers aren’t aware of the return issues, leading to “substantial unjustified monetary losses by consumers.” Amazon began issuing refunds to customers who claimed they never got a refund for returned items last year.

Amazon has also agreed to commit $363 million toward improving its return and refund practices, but it denied any wrongdoing. “The monetary relief from the settlement will likely represent a full recovery for every class member — plus interest,” lawyers for the class write in the settlement. It’s still awaiting approval by US District Court Judge Jamal Whitehead.

“Following an internal review in 2025, we identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent back to us, so no refund had been issued,” Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “We started issuing refunds in 2025 for these returns and are providing additional compensation and refunds to eligible customers per the settlement agreement.”

In addition to this settlement, Amazon is on the hook to pay $2.5 billion to resolve the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit that accused the company of tricking millions of people into signing up for Prime. Customers impacted by these alleged practices can file a claim now.

Update, January 27th: Added a statement from Amazon.

Up to 700 employees are set to be laid off by September 30th.

Pinterest is planning to lay off hundreds of workers and reduce its office space to reallocate resources for its artificial intelligence initiatives. In a regulatory filing posted Tuesday, Pinterest says the reduction is expected to impact “less than 15 percent” of its current workforce, and that the layoffs should be complete by September 30th, 2026.

Pinterest said it had 4,666 full-time employees as of the end of 2024, which would mean around 700 staffers are impacted by today’s announcement. The document said these changes are to support three “transformation initiatives,” with two of them connected to AI:

Off the back of these changes, Pinterest is set to incur pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $35 million to $45 million.

We have reached out to Pinterest for comment.

The deluge of AI-generated content on Pinterest has been criticized by users — enough so to prompt the company into making features that detect AI images and see less of it in feeds — but that hasn’t deterred Pinterest from injecting the technology across its platform. In October, it released an AI Pinterest Shopping assistant that provides personalized recommendations. The following month, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said that “our investments in AI and product innovation are paying off,” and that the platform had effectively become “an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million consumers.”

You’ll need some deep pockets in more than one way.

Samsung’s much-anticipated Galaxy Z Trifold goes on sale on this Friday, January 26th, and the price is every bit as steep as we’d feared: $2,899, which gets you 512GB of storage and a phone that kind of wants to be a tablet all the time. The Trifold first premiered in Korea late last year, so the sky-high price isn’t totally unexpected. You can spend two thousand bucks on a slab-style iPhone after all; maybe $2,900 for three phones in one isn’t so outrageous.

Samsung first teased the Trifold almost exactly a year ago, which is a pretty rapid journey from teaser to shipping product — especially considering that there’s really just one other company making a phone like this. And that trifold isn’t sold in the US, so you’re probably gonna spend more than $2,900 to get one imported. If you’re in the US and itching to get your hands on a trifolding phone, then you’ll want to have your credit card ready to go later this week.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Humans have long dreamed of living among the stars, and for two decades hundreds of us have done so aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But a new era is about to begin in which private companies operate orbital outposts—with the promise of much greater access to space than before.

The ISS is aging and is expected to be brought down from orbit into the ocean in 2031. To replace it, NASA has awarded more than $500 million to several companies to develop private space stations, while others have built versions on their own. Read why we made them one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year, and check out the rest of the list.

Why one developer won’t quit fighting to connect the US’s gridsMichael Skelly hasn’t learned to take no for an answer. For much of the last 15 years, the energy entrepreneur has worked to develop long-haul transmission lines to carry wind power across the Great Plains, Midwest, and Southwest. But so far, he has little to show for the effort.

Skelly has long argued that building such lines and linking together the nation’s grids would accelerate the shift from coal- and natural-gas-fueled power plants to the renewables needed to cut the pollution driving climate change. But his previous business shut down in 2019, after halting two of its projects and selling off interests in three more.

Skelly contends he was early, not wrong. And he has a point: markets and policymakers are increasingly coming around to his perspective. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">In the three years since ChatGPT’s explosive debut, OpenAI’s technology has upended a remarkable range of everyday activities at home, at work, in schools—anywhere people have a browser open or a phone out, which is everywhere.

Now OpenAI is making an explicit play for scientists. In October, the firm announced that it had launched a whole new team, called OpenAI for Science, dedicated to exploring how its large language models could help scientists and tweaking its tools to support them.

The last couple of months have seen a slew of social media posts and academic publications in which mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and others have described how LLMs (and OpenAI’s GPT-5 in particular) have helped them make a discovery or nudged them toward a solution they might otherwise have missed. In part, OpenAI for Science was set up to engage with this community.

And yet OpenAI is also late to the party. Google DeepMind, the rival firm behind groundbreaking scientific models such as AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, has had an AI-for-science team for years. (When I spoke to Google DeepMind’s CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis in 2023 about that team, he told me: “This is the reason I started DeepMind … In fact, it’s why I’ve worked my whole career in AI.”)

So why now? How does a push into science fit with OpenAI’s wider mission? And what exactly is the firm hoping to achieve?

I put these questions to Kevin Weil, a vice president at OpenAI who leads the new OpenAI for Science team, in an exclusive interview last week.

Weil is a product guy. He joined OpenAI a couple of years ago as chief product officer after being head of product at Twitter and Instagram. But he started out as a scientist. He got two-thirds of the way through a PhD in particle physics at Stanford University before ditching academia for the Silicon Valley dream. Weil is keen to highlight his pedigree: “I thought I was going to be a physics professor for the rest of my life,” he says. “I still read math books on vacation.”

Asked how OpenAI for Science fits with the firm’s existing lineup of white-collar productivity tools or the viral video app Sora, Weil recites the company mantra: “The mission of OpenAI is to try and build artificial general intelligence and, you know, make it beneficial for all of humanity.”

Just imagine the future impact this technology could have on science he says: New medicines, new materials, new devices. “Think about it helping us understand the nature of reality, helping us think through open problems. Maybe the biggest, most positive impact we’re going to see from AGI will actually be from its ability to accelerate science.”

He adds: “With GPT-5, we saw that becoming possible.”

As Weil tells it, LLMs are now good enough to be useful scientific collaborators. They can spitball ideas, suggest novel directions to explore, and find fruitful parallels between new problems and old solutions published in obscure journals decades ago or in foreign languages.

That wasn’t the case a year or so ago. Since it announced its first so-called reasoning model—a type of LLM that can break down problems into multiple steps and work through them one by one—in December 2024, OpenAI has been pushing the envelope of what the technology can do. Reasoning models have made LLMs far better at solving math and logic problems than they used to be. “You go back a few years and we were all collectively mind-blown that the models could get an 800 on the SAT,” says Weil.

But soon LLMs were acing math competitions and solving graduate-level physics problems. Last year, OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announced that their LLMs had achieved gold-medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad, one of the toughest math contests in the world. “These models are no longer just better than 90% of grad students,” says Weil. “They’re really at the frontier of human abilities.”

That’s a huge claim, and it comes with caveats. Still, there’s no doubt that GPT-5, which includes a reasoning model,  is a big improvement on GPT-4 when it comes to complicated problem-solving. Measured against an industry benchmark known as GPQA, which includes more than 400 multiple-choice questions that test PhD-level knowledge in biology, physics, and chemistry, GPT-4 scores 39%, well below the human-expert baseline of around 70%. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 (the latest update to the model, released in December) scores 92%.

The excitement is evident—and perhaps excessive. In October, senior figures at OpenAI, including Weil, boasted on X that GPT-5 had found solutions to several unsolved math problems. Mathematicians were quick to point out that in fact what GPT-5 appeared to have done was dig up existing solutions in old research papers, including at least one written in German. That was still useful, but it wasn’t the achievement OpenAI seemed to have claimed. Weil and his colleagues deleted their posts.

Now Weil is more careful. It is often enough to find answers that exist but have been forgotten, he says: “We collectively stand on the shoulders of giants, and if LLMs can kind of accumulate that knowledge so that we don’t spend time struggling on a problem that is already solved, that’s an acceleration all of its own.”

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”

For Weil, the question is this: “Does science actually happen faster because scientists plus models can do much more, and do it more quickly, than scientists alone? I think we’re already seeing that.”

In November, OpenAI published a series of anecdotal case studies contributed by scientists, both inside and outside the company, that illustrated how they had used GPT-5 and how it had helped. “Most of the cases were scientists that were already using GPT-5 directly in their research and had come to us one way or another saying, ‘Look at what I’m able to do with these tools,’” says Weil.

The key things that GPT-5 seems to be good at are finding references and connections to existing work that scientists were not aware of, which sometimes sparks new ideas; helping scientists sketch mathematical proofs; and suggesting ways for scientists to test hypotheses in the lab.

“GPT 5.2 has read substantially every paper written in the last 30 years,” says Weil. “And it understands not just the field that a particular scientist is working in; it can bring together analogies from other, unrelated fields.”

“That’s incredibly powerful,” he continues. “You can always find a human collaborator in an adjacent field, but it’s difficult to find, you know, a thousand collaborators in all thousand adjacent fields that might matter. And in addition to that, I can work with the model late at night—it doesn’t sleep—and I can ask it 10 things in parallel, which is kind of awkward to do to a human.”

Most of the scientists OpenAI reached out to back up Weil’s position.

Robert Scherrer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, only played around with ChatGPT for fun (“I used to it rewrite the theme song for Gilligan’s Island in the style of Beowulf, which it did very well,” he tells me) until his Vanderbilt colleague Alex Lupsasca, a fellow physicist who now works at OpenAI, told him that GPT-5 had helped solve a problem he’d been working on.

Lupsasca gave Scherrer access to GPT-5 Pro, OpenAI’s $200-a-month premium subscription. “It managed to solve a problem that I and my graduate student could not solve despite working on it for several months,” says Scherrer.

It’s not perfect, he says: “GTP-5 still makes dumb mistakes. Of course, I do too, but the mistakes GPT-5 makes are even dumber.” And yet it keeps getting better, he says: “If current trends continue—and that’s a big if—I suspect that all scientists will be using LLMs soon.”

Derya Unutmaz, a professor of biology at the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute, uses GPT-5 to brainstorm ideas, summarize papers, and plan experiments in his work studying the immune system. In the case study he shared with OpenAI, Unutmaz used GPT-5 to analyze an old data set that his team had previously looked at. The model came up with fresh insights and interpretations.

“LLMs are already essential for scientists,” he says. “When you can complete analysis of data sets that used to take months, not using them is not an option anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says he has been using LLMs in his research since the first version of ChatGPT came out.

Like Scherrer, he finds LLMs most useful when they highlight unexpected connections between his own work and existing results he did not know about. “I believe that LLMs are becoming an essential technical tool for scientists, much like computers and the internet did before,” he says. “I expect a long-term disadvantage for those who do not use them.”

But he does not expect LLMs to make novel discoveries anytime soon. “I have seen very few genuinely fresh ideas or arguments that would be worth a publication on their own,” he says. “So far, they seem to mainly combine existing results, sometimes incorrectly, rather than produce genuinely new approaches.”

I also contacted a handful of scientists who are not connected to OpenAI.

Andy Cooper, a professor of chemistry at the University of Liverpool and director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, is less enthusiastic. “We have not found, yet, that LLMs are fundamentally changing the way that science is done,” he says. “But our recent results suggest that they do have a place.”

Cooper is leading a project to develop a so-called AI scientist that can fully automate parts of the scientific workflow. He says that his team doesn’t use LLMs to come up with ideas. But the tech is starting to prove useful as part of a wider automated system where an LLM can help direct robots, for example.

“My guess is that LLMs might stick more in robotic workflows, at least initially, because I’m not sure that people are ready to be told what to do by an LLM,” says Cooper. “I’m certainly not.”

LLMs may be becoming more and more useful, but caution is still key. In December, Jonathan Oppenheim, a scientist who works on quantum mechanics, called out a mistake that had made its way into a scientific journal. “OpenAI leadership are promoting a paper in Physics Letters B where GPT-5 proposed the main idea—possibly the first peer-reviewed paper where an LLM generated the core contribution,” Oppenheim posted on X. “One small problem: GPT-5’s idea tests the wrong thing.”

He continued: “GPT-5 was asked for a test that detects nonlinear theories. It provided a test that detects nonlocal ones. Related-sounding, but different. It’s like asking for a COVID test, and the LLM cheerfully hands you a test for chickenpox.”

It is clear that a lot of scientists are finding innovative and intuitive ways to engage with LLMs. It is also clear that the technology makes mistakes that can be so subtle even experts miss them.

Part of the problem is the way ChatGPT can flatter you into letting down your guard. As Oppenheim put it: “A core issue is that LLMs are being trained to validate the user, while science needs tools that challenge us.” In an extreme case, one individual (who was not a scientist) was persuaded by ChatGPT into thinking for months that he’d invented a new branch of mathematics.

Of course, Weil is well aware of the problem of hallucination. But he insists that newer models are hallucinating less and less. Even so, focusing on hallucination might be missing the point, he says.

“One of my teammates here, an ex math professor, said something that stuck with me,” says Weil. “He said: ‘When I’m doing research, if I’m bouncing ideas off a colleague, I’m wrong 90% of the time and that’s kind of the point. We’re both spitballing ideas and trying to find something that works.’”

“That’s actually a desirable place to be,” says Weil. “If you say enough wrong things and then somebody stumbles on a grain of truth and then the other person seizes on it and says, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s not quite right, but what if we—’ You gradually kind of find your trail through the woods.”

This is Weil’s core vision for OpenAI for Science. GPT-5 is good, but it is not an oracle. The value of this technology is in pointing people in new directions, not coming up with definitive answers, he says.

In fact, one of the things OpenAI is now looking at is making GPT-5 dial down its confidence when it delivers a response. Instead of saying Here’s the answer, it might tell scientists: Here’s something to consider.

“That’s actually something that we are spending a bunch of time on,” says Weil. “Trying to make sure that the model has some sort of epistemological humility.”

Another thing OpenAI is looking at is how to use GPT-5 to fact-check GPT-5. It’s often the case that if you feed one of GPT-5’s answers back into the model, it will pick it apart and highlight mistakes.

“You can kind of hook the model up as its own critic,” says Weil. “Then you can get a workflow where the model is thinking and then it goes to another model, and if that model finds things that it could improve, then it passes it back to the original model and says, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this part wasn’t right, but this part was interesting. Keep it.’ It’s almost like a couple of agents working together and you only see the output once it passes the critic.”

What Weil is describing also sounds a lot like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaEvolve, a tool that wrapped the firms LLM, Gemini, inside a wider system that filtered out the good responses from the bad and fed them back in again to be improved on. Google DeepMind has used AlphaEvolve to solve several real-world problems.

OpenAI faces stiff competition from rival firms, whose own LLMs can do most, if not all, of the things it claims for its own models. If that’s the case, why should scientists use GPT-5 instead of Gemini or Anthropic’s Claude, families of models that are themselves improving every year? Ultimately, OpenAI for Science may be as much an effort to plant a flag in new territory as anything else. The real innovations are still to come.

“I think 2026 will be for science what 2025 was for software engineering,” says Weil. “At the beginning of 2025, if you were using AI to write most of your code, you were an early adopter. Whereas 12 months later, if you’re not using AI to write most of your code, you’re probably falling behind. We’re now seeing those same early flashes for science as we did for code.”

He continues: “I think that in a year, if you’re a scientist and you’re not heavily using AI, you’ll be missing an opportunity to increase the quality and pace of your thinking.”

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?

This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly. Two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates.

In one corner is the Republican Party, which has supported laws passed in several states that require sites with adult content to verify users’ ages. Critics say this provides cover to block anything deemed “harmful to minors,” which could include sex education. Other states, like California, are coming after AI companies with laws to protect kids who talk to chatbots (by requiring them to verify who’s a kid). Meanwhile, President Trump is attempting to keep AI regulation a national issue rather than allowing states to make their own rules. Support for various bills in Congress is constantly in flux.

So what might happen? The debate is quickly moving away from whether age verification is necessary and toward who will be responsible for it. This responsibility is a hot potato that no company wants to hold.

In a blog post last Tuesday, OpenAI revealed that it plans to roll out automatic age prediction. In short, the company will apply a model that uses factors like the time of day, among others, to predict whether a person chatting is under 18. For those identified as teens or children, ChatGPT will apply filters to “reduce exposure” to content like graphic violence or sexual role-play. YouTube launched something similar last year.

If you support age verification but are concerned about privacy, this might sound like a win. But there&#39;s a catch. The system is not perfect, of course, so it could classify a child as an adult or vice versa. People who are wrongly labeled under 18 can verify their identity by submitting a selfie or government ID to a company called Persona.

Selfie verifications have issues: They fail more often for people of color and those with certain disabilities. Sameer Hinduja, who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center, says the fact that Persona will need to hold millions of government IDs and masses of biometric data is another weak point. “When those get breached, we’ve exposed massive populations all at once,” he says.

Hinduja instead advocates for device-level verification, where a parent specifies a child’s age when setting up the child’s phone for the first time. This information is then kept on the device and shared securely with apps and websites.

That’s more or less what Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently lobbied US lawmakers to call for. Cook was fighting lawmakers who wanted to require app stores to verify ages, which would saddle Apple with lots of liability.

More signals of where this is all headed will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Trade Commission—the agency that would be responsible for enforcing these new laws—is holding an all-day workshop on age verification. Apple’s head of government affairs, Nick Rossi, will be there. He’ll be joined by higher-ups in child safety at Google and Meta, as well as a company that specializes in marketing to children.

The FTC has become increasingly politicized under President Trump (his firing of the sole Democratic commissioner was struck down by a federal court, a decision that is now pending review by the US Supreme Court). In July, I wrote about signals that the agency is softening its stance toward AI companies. Indeed, in December, the FTC overturned a Biden-era ruling against an AI company that allowed people to flood the internet with fake product reviews, writing that it clashed with President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

Wednesday’s workshop may shed light on how partisan the FTC’s approach to age verification will be. Red states favor laws that require porn websites to verify ages (but critics warn this could be used to block a much wider range of content). Bethany Soye, a Republican state representative who is leading an effort to pass such a bill in her state of South Dakota, is scheduled to speak at the FTC meeting. The ACLU generally opposes laws requiring IDs to visit websites and has instead advocated for an expansion of existing parental controls.

While all this gets debated, though, AI has set the world of child safety on fire. We’re dealing with increased generation of child sexual abuse material, concerns (and lawsuits) about suicides and self-harm following chatbot conversations, and troubling evidence of kids’ forming attachments to AI companions. Colliding stances on privacy, politics, free expression, and surveillance will complicate any effort to find a solution. Write to me with your thoughts.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/26/1124655/the-power-of-sound-in-a-virtual-world/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In an era where business, education, and even casual conversations occur via screens, sound has become a differentiating factor. We obsess over lighting, camera angles, and virtual backgrounds, but how we sound can be just as critical to credibility, trust, and connection.

That’s the insight driving Erik Vaveris, vice president of product management and chief marketing officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University. Both see audio as more than a technical layer: It’s a human factor shaping how people perceive intelligence, trustworthiness, and authority in virtual settings.

&quot;If you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course, your customers,&quot; says Vaveris.

Scholl’s research shows that poor audio quality can make a speaker seem less persuasive, less hireable, and even less credible.

&quot;We know that [poor] sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions,&quot; says Scholl. &quot;We all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way, to a surprising degree, that this is not so.&quot;

For organizations navigating hybrid work, training, and marketing, the stakes have become high.

Vaveris points out that the pandemic was a watershed moment for audio technology. As classrooms, boardrooms, and conferences shifted online almost overnight, demand accelerated for advanced noise suppression, echo cancellation, and AI-driven processing tools that make meetings more seamless. Today, machine learning algorithms can strip away keyboard clicks or reverberation and isolate a speaker’s voice in noisy environments. That clarity underpins the accuracy of AI meeting assistants that can step in to transcribe, summarize, and analyze discussions.

The implications across industries are rippling. Clearer audio levels the playing field for remote participants, enabling inclusive collaboration. It empowers executives and creators alike to produce broadcast-quality content from the comfort of their home office. And it offers companies new ways to build credibility with customers and employees without the costly overhead of traditional production.

Looking forward, the convergence of audio innovation and AI promises an even more dynamic landscape: from real-time captioning in your native language to audio filtering, to smarter meeting tools that capture not only what is said but how it’s said, and to technologies that disappear into the background while amplifying the human voice at the center.

&quot;There&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together,&quot; says Vaveris. &quot;Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

In a world increasingly mediated by screens, sound may prove to be the most powerful connector of all.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.Our topic today is the power of sound. As our personal and professional lives become increasingly virtual, audio is emerging as an essential tool for everything from remote work to virtual conferences to virtual happy hour. While appearance is often top of mind in video conferencing and streaming, audio can be as or even more important, not only to effective communication, but potentially to brand equity for both the speaker and the company.Two words for you: crystal clear.My guests today are Erik Vaveris, VP of Product Management and Chief Marketing Officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, Director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University.Welcome, Erik and Brian.

Erik Vaveris: Thank you, Megan. And hello, Brian. Thrilled to be here today.

Megan: Fantastic. Thank you both so much for being here. Erik, let&#39;s open with a bit of background. I imagine the pandemic changed the audio industry in some significant ways, given the pivot to our modern remote hybrid lifestyles. Could you talk a bit about that journey and some of the interesting audio advances that arose from that transformative shift?

Erik: Absolutely, Megan. That&#39;s an interesting thing to think about now being here in 2025. And if you put yourself back in those moments in 2020, when things were fully shut down and everything was fully remote, the importance of audio quality became immediately obvious. As people adopted Zoom or Teams or platforms like that overnight, there were a lot of technical challenges that people experienced, but the importance of how they were presenting themselves to people via their audio quality was a bit less obvious. As Brian&#39;s noted in a lot of the press that he&#39;s received for his wonderful study, we know how we look on video. We can see ourselves back on the screen, but we don&#39;t know how we sound to the people with whom we&#39;re speaking.

If a meeting participant on the other side can manage to parse the words that you&#39;re saying, they&#39;re not likely to speak up and say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m having a little bit of trouble hearing you.&quot; They&#39;ll just let the meeting continue. And if you don&#39;t have a really strong level of audio quality, you&#39;re asking the people that you&#39;re talking to devote way too much brainpower to just determining the words that you&#39;re saying. And you&#39;re going to be fatiguing to listen to. And your message won&#39;t come across. In contrast, if you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course your customers. Back in 2020, this very quickly became a marketing story that we had to tell immediately.

And I have to say, it&#39;s so gratifying to see Brian&#39;s research in the news because, to me, it was like, &quot;Yes, this is what we&#39;ve been experiencing. And this is what we&#39;ve been trying to educate people about.&quot; Having the real science to back it up means a lot. But from that, development on improvements to key audio processing algorithms accelerated across the whole AV industry.

I think, Megan and Brian, you probably remember hearing loud keyboard clicking when you were on calls and meetings, or people eating potato chips and things like that back on those. But you don&#39;t hear that much today because most platforms have invested in AI-trained algorithms to remove undesirable noises. And I know we&#39;re going to talk more about that later on.

But the other thing that happened, thankfully, was that as we got into the late spring and summer of 2020, was that educational institutions, especially universities, and also businesses realized that things were going to need to change quickly. Nothing was going to be the same. And universities realized that all classrooms were going to need hybrid capabilities for both remote students and students in the classroom. And that helped the market for professional AV equipment start to recover because we had been pretty much completely shut down in the earlier months. But that focus on hybrid meeting spaces of all types accelerated more investment and more R&D into making equipment and further developing those key audio processing algorithms for more and different types of spaces and use cases. And since then, we&#39;ve really seen a proliferation of different types of unobtrusive audio capture devices based on arrays of microphones and the supporting signal processing behind them. And right now, machine-learning-trained signal processing is really the norm. And that all accelerated, unfortunately, because of the pandemic.

Megan: Yeah. Such an interesting period of change, as you say. And Brian, what did you observe and experience in academia during that time? How did that time period affect the work at your lab?

Brian: I&#39;ll admit, Megan, I had never given a single thought to audio quality or anything like that, certainly until the pandemic hit. I was thrown into this, just like the rest of the world was. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d ever had a single video conference with a student or with a class or anything like that before the pandemic hit. But in some ways, our experience in universities was quite extreme. I went on a Tuesday from teaching an in-person class with 300 students to being on Zoom with everyone suddenly on a Thursday. Business meetings come in all shapes and sizes. But this was quite extreme. This was a case where suddenly I&#39;m talking to hundreds and hundreds of people over Zoom. And every single one of them knows exactly what I sound like, except for me, because I&#39;m just speaking my normal voice and I have no idea how it&#39;s being translated through all the different levels of technology.

I will say, part of the general rhetoric we have about the pandemic focuses on all the negatives and the lack of personal connection and nuance and the fact that we can&#39;t see how everyone&#39;s paying attention to each other. Our experience was a bit more mixed. I&#39;ll just tell you one anecdote. Shortly after the pandemic started, I started teaching a seminar with about 20 students. And of course, this was still online. What I did is I just invited, for whatever topic we were discussing on any given day, I sent a note to whoever was the clear world leader in the study of whatever that topic was. I said, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t prepare a talk. You don&#39;t have to answer any questions. But just come join us on Zoom and just participate in the conversation. The students will have read some of your work.&quot;

Every single one of them said, &quot;Let me check my schedule. Oh, I&#39;m stuck at home for a year. Sure. I&#39;d be happy to do that.&quot; And that was quite a positive. The students got to meet a who&#39;s who of cognitive science from this experience. And it&#39;s true that there were all these technological difficulties, but that would never, ever have happened if we were teaching the class in real life. That would&#39;ve just been way too much travel and airfare and hotel and scheduling and all of that. So, it was a mixed bag for us.

Erik: That is really interesting. And that&#39;s such a cool idea. And it&#39;s so wonderful that that worked out. I would say that working for a global company, we like to think that, &quot;Oh, we&#39;re all together. And we&#39;re having these meetings. And we&#39;re in the same room,&quot; but the reality was we weren&#39;t in the same room. And there hadn&#39;t been enough attention paid to the people who were conferencing in speaking not their native language in a different time zone, maybe pretty deep into the evening, in some cases. And the remote work that everybody got thrown into immediately at the start of the pandemic did force everybody to start to think more about those types of interactions and put everybody on a level playing field.

And that was insightful. And that helped some people have stronger voices in the work that we were doing than they maybe did before. And it&#39;s also led businesses really across the board, there&#39;s a lot written about this, to be much more focused on making sure that participants from those who may be remote at home, may be in the office, may be in different offices, may be in different time zones, are all able to participate and collaborate on really a level playing field. And that is a positive. That&#39;s a good thing.

Megan: Yeah. There are absolutely some positive side effects there, aren&#39;t there? And it inspired you, Brian, to look at this more closely. And you&#39;ve done a study that shows poor audio quality can actually affect the perception of listeners. So, I wonder what prompted the study, in particular. And what kinds of data did you gather? What methodology did you use?

Brian: Yeah. The motivation for this study was actually a real-world experience, just like we&#39;ve been talking about. In addition to all of our classes moving online with no notice whatsoever, the same thing was true of our departmental faculty meetings. Very early on in the pandemic, we had one of these meetings. And we were talking about some contentious issue about hiring or whatever. And two of my colleagues, who I&#39;d known very well and for many, many years, spoke up to offer their opinions. And one of these colleagues is someone who I&#39;m very close with. We almost always see eye to eye. He was actually a former graduate student of mine once upon a time. And we almost always see eye to eye on things. He happened to be participating in that meeting from an old not-so-hot laptop. His audio quality had that sort of familiar tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with. I could totally understand everything he was saying, but I found myself just being a little skeptical.

I didn&#39;t find his points so compelling as usual. Meanwhile, I had another colleague, someone who I deeply respect, I&#39;ve collaborated with, but we don&#39;t always see eye to eye on these things. And he was participating in this first virtual faculty meeting from his home recording studio. Erik, I don&#39;t know if his equipment would be up to your level or not, but he sounded better than real life. He sounded like he was all around us. And I found myself just sort of naturally agreeing with his points, which sort of was notable and a little surprising in that context. And so, we turned this into a study.

We played people a number of short audio clips, maybe like 30 seconds or so. And we had these being played in the context of very familiar situations and decisions. One of them might be like a hiring decision. You would have to listen to this person telling you why they think they might be a good fit for your job. And then afterwards, you had to make a simple judgment. It might be of a trait. How intelligent did that person seem? Or it might be a real-world decision like, &quot;Hey, based on this, how likely would you be to pursue trying to hire them?&quot; And critically, we had people listen to exactly the same sort of scripts, but with a little bit of work behind the scenes to affect the audio quality. In one case, the audio sounded crisp and clear. Recorded with a decent microphone. And here&#39;s what it sounded like.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: Okay. Whatever you think of the content of that message, at least it&#39;s nice and clear. Other subjects listened to exactly the same recording. But again, it had that sort of tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with when people&#39;s voices are filtered through a microphone or a recording setup that&#39;s not so hot. That sounded like this.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: All right. Now, the thing that I hope you can get from that recording there is that although it clearly has this what we would call, as a technical term, a disfluent sound, it&#39;s just a little harder to process, you are ultimately successful, right? Megan, Erik, you were able to understand the words in that second recording.

Brian: And we made sure this was true for all of our subjects. We had them do word-for-word transcription after they made these judgments. And I&#39;ll also just point out that this kind of manipulation clearly can&#39;t be about the person themselves, right? You couldn&#39;t make your voices sound like that in real world conversation if you tried. Voices just don&#39;t do those sorts of things. Nevertheless, in a way that sort of didn&#39;t make sense, that was kind of irrational because this couldn&#39;t reflect the person, this affected all sorts of judgments about people.

So, people were judged to be about 8% less hirable. They were judged to be about 8% less intelligent. We also did this in other contexts. We did this in the context of dateability as if you were listening to a little audio clip from someone who was maybe interested in dating you, and then you had to make a judgment of how likely would you be to date this person. Same exact result. People were a little less datable when their audio was a little more tinny, even though they were completely understandable.

The experiment, the result that I thought was in some ways most striking is one of the clips was about someone who had been in a car accident. It was a little narrative about what had happened in the car accident. And they were talking as if to the insurance agent. They were saying, &quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t my fault. This is what happened.&quot; And afterwards, we simply had people make a natural intuitive judgment of how credible do you think the person&#39;s story was. And when it was recorded with high-end audio, these messages were judged to be about 8% more credible in this context. So those are our experiments. What it shows really is something about the power of perception. We know that that sort of sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions made. And I don&#39;t know about you guys, but, Erik, I think you&#39;re right, that we all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way to a surprising degree that this is not so.

Megan: From an industry perspective, Erik, what are your thoughts on those study results? Did it surprise you as well?

Erik: No, like I said, I found it very, very gratifying because we invest a lot in trying to make sure that people understand the importance of quality audio, but we kind of come about that intuitively. Our entire company is audio people. So of course, we think that. And it&#39;s our mission to help other people achieve those higher levels of audio in everything that they do, whether you&#39;re a minister at a church or you&#39;re teaching a class or you&#39;re performing on stage. When I first saw in the news about Brian&#39;s study, I think it was the NPR article that just came up in one of my feeds. I read it and it made me feel like my life&#39;s work has been validated to some extent. I wouldn&#39;t say we were surprised by it, but iIt made a lot of sense to us. Let&#39;s put it that way.

Brian: This is what we&#39;re hearing. Oh, sorry. Megan, I was going to say this is what we&#39;re hearing from a lot of the audio professionals as they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hey, you scientists, you finally caught up to us.&quot; But of course-

Brian: Erik, you&#39;re in an unusual circumstance because you guys think about audio every day. When we&#39;re on Zoom, look, I can see the little rectangle as well as you can. I can see exactly how I look like. I can check the lighting. I check my hair. We all do that every day. But I would say most people really, they use whatever microphone came with their setup, and never give a second thought to what they sound like because they don&#39;t know what they sound like.

Megan: Avoid listening to yourself back as well. I think that&#39;s common. We don&#39;t scrutinize audio as much as we should. I wonder, Erik, since the study came out, how are you seeing that research play out across industry? Can you talk a bit about the importance of strong, clear audio in today&#39;s virtual world and the challenges that companies and employees are facing as well?

Erik: Yeah. Sure, Megan. That&#39;s a great question. And studies kind of back this up, businesses understand that collaboration is the key to many things that we do. They know that that&#39;s critical. And they are investing in making the experiences for the people at work better because of that knowledge, that intuitive understanding. But there are challenges. It can be expensive. You need solutions that people who are going to walk into a room or join a meeting on their personal device, that they&#39;re motivated to use and that they can use because they&#39;re simple. You also have to overcome the barriers to investment. We in the AV industry have had to look a lot at how can we bring down the overall cost of ownership of setting up AV technology because, as we&#39;ve seen, the prices of everything that goes into making a product are not coming down.

Simplifying deployment and management is critical. Beyond just audio technology, IoT technology and cloud technology for IT teams to be able to easily deploy and manage classrooms across an entire university campus or conference rooms across a global enterprise are really, really critical. And those are quickly evolving. And integrations with more standard common IT tools are coming out. And that&#39;s one area. Another thing is just for the end user, having the same user interface in each conference room that is familiar to everyone from their personal devices is also important. For many, many years, a lot of people had the experience where, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s time we&#39;re going to actually do a conference meeting.&quot; And you might have a few rooms in your company or in your office area that could do that. And you walk into the meeting room. And how long does it take you to actually get connected to the people you&#39;re going to talk with?

There was always a joke that you&#39;d have to spend the first 15 minutes of a meeting working all of that out. And that&#39;s because the technology was fragmented and you had to do a lot of custom work to make that happen. But these days, I would say platforms like Zoom and Teams and Google and others are doing a really great job with this. If you have the latest and greatest in your meeting rooms and you know how to join from your own personal device, it&#39;s basically the same experience. And that is streamlining the process for everyone. Bringing down the costs of owning it so that companies can get to those benefits to collaboration is kind of the key.

Megan: I was going to ask if we could dive a little deeper into that kind of audio quality, the technological advancements that AI has made possible, which you did touch on slightly there, Erik. What are the most significant advancements, in your view? And how are those impacting the ways we use audio and the things we can do with it?

Erik: Okay. Let me try to break that down into-

Erik: ... a couple different sections. Yeah. No, and one that&#39;s just so exciting. Machine-learning-based digital signal processing, or DSP, is here and is the norm now. If you think about the beginning of telephones and teleconferencing, just going way back, one of the initial problems you had whenever you tried to get something out of a dedicated handset onto a table was echo. And I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all heard that at some point in our life. You need to have a way to cancel echo. But by the way, you also want people to be able to speak at the same time on both ends of a call. You get to some of those very rudimentary things. Machine learning is really supercharging those algorithms to provide better performance with fewer trade-offs, fewer artifacts in the actual audio signal.

Noise reduction has come a long way. I mentioned earlier on, keyboard sounds and the sounds of people eating, and how you just don&#39;t hear that anymore, at least I don&#39;t when I&#39;m on conference calls. But only a few years ago, that could be a major problem. The machine-learning-trained digital signal processing is in the market now and it&#39;s doing a better job than ever in removing things that you don&#39;t want from your sound. We have a new de-verberation algorithm, so if you have a reverberant room with echoes and reflections that&#39;s getting into the audio signal, that can degrade the experience there. We can remove that now. Another thing, the flip side of that is that there&#39;s also a focus on isolating the sound that you do want and the signal that you do want.

Microsoft has rolled out a voice print feature in Teams that allows you, if you&#39;re willing, to provide them with a sample of your voice. And then whenever you&#39;re talking from your device, it will take out anything else that the microphone may be picking up so that even if you&#39;re in a really noisy environment outdoors or, say, in an airport, the people that you&#39;re speaking with are going to hear you and only you. And it&#39;s pretty amazing as well. So those are some of the things that are happening today and are available today.

Another thing that&#39;s emerged from all of this is we&#39;ve been talking about how important audio quality is to the people participating in a discussion, the people speaking, the people listening, how everyone is perceived, but a new consumer, if you will, of audio in a discussion or a meeting has emerged, and that is in the form of the AI agent that can summarize meetings and create action plans, do those sorts of things. But for it to work, a clean transcription of what was said is already table stakes. It can&#39;t garbled. It can&#39;t miss key things. It needs to get it word for word, sentence for sentence throughout the entire meeting. And the ability to attribute who said what to the meeting participants, even if they&#39;re all in the same room, is quickly upon us. And the ability to detect and integrate sentiment and emotion of the participants is going to become very important as well for us to really get the full value out of those kinds of AI agents.

So audio quality is as important as ever for humans, as Brian notes, in some ways more important because this is now the normal way that we talk and meet, but it&#39;s also critical for AI agents to work properly. And it&#39;s different, right? It&#39;s a different set of considerations. And there&#39;s a lot of emerging thought and work that&#39;s going into that as well. And boy, Megan, there&#39;s so much more we could say about this beyond meetings and video conferences. AI tools to simplify the production process. And of course, there&#39;s generative AI of music content. I know that&#39;s beyond the scope of what we&#39;re talking about. But it&#39;s really pretty incredible when you look around at the work that&#39;s happening and the capabilities that are emerging.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. Sounds like there are so many elements to consider and work going on. It&#39;s all fascinating. Brian, what kinds of emerging capabilities and use cases around AI and audio quality are you seeing in your lab as well?

Brian: Yeah. Well, I&#39;m sorry that Brian himself was not able to be here today, but I&#39;m an AI agent.

Brian: Just kidding. The fascinating thing that we&#39;re seeing from the lab, from the study of people&#39;s impressions is that all of this technology that Erik has described, when it works best, it&#39;s completely invisible. Erik, I loved your point about not hearing potato chips being eaten or rain in the background or something like that. You&#39;re totally right. I used to notice that all the time. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve noticed that recently, but I also didn&#39;t notice that I haven&#39;t noticed that recently, right? It just kind of disappears. The interesting thing about these perceptual impressions, we&#39;re constantly drawing intuitive conclusions about people based on how they sound. And that might be a good thing or a bad thing when we&#39;re judging things like trustworthiness, for example, on the basis of a short audio clip.

But clearly, some of these things are valid, right? We can judge the size of someone or even of an animal based on how they sound, right? A chihuahua can&#39;t make the sound of a lion. A lion can&#39;t make the sound of a chihuahua. And that&#39;s always been true because we&#39;re producing audio signals that go right into each other&#39;s ears. And now, of course, everything that Erik is talking about, that&#39;s not true. It goes through all of these different layers of technology increasingly fueled by AI. But when that technology works the best way, it&#39;s as if it isn&#39;t there at all and we&#39;re just hearing each other directly.

Erik: That&#39;s the goal, right? That it&#39;s seamless open communication and we don&#39;t have to think about the technology anymore.

Brian: It&#39;s a tough business to be in, I think, though, Erik, because people have to know what&#39;s going on behind the surface in order to value it. Otherwise, we just expect it to work.

Erik: Well, that&#39;s why we try to put the logo of our products on the side of them so they show up in the videos. But yeah, it&#39;s a good point.

Megan: And we&#39;ve talked about virtual meetings and conversations quite a bit, but there&#39;s also streamed and recorded content, which are increasingly important at work as well. I wondered, Erik, if you could talk a bit about how businesses are leveraging audio in new ways for things like marketing campaigns and internal upskilling and training and areas like that?

Erik: Yeah. Well, one of the things I think we&#39;ve all seen in marketing is that not everything is a high production value commercial anymore. And there&#39;s still a place for that, for sure. But people tend to trust influencers that they follow. People search on TikTok, on YouTube for topics. Those can be the place that they start. And as technology&#39;s gotten more accessible, not just audio, but of course, the video technology too, content creators can produce satisfying content on their own or with just a couple of people with them. And Brian&#39;s study shows that it doesn&#39;t really matter what the origins of the content are for it to be compelling.

For the person delivering the message to be compelling, the audio quality does have to hit a certain level. But because the tools are simpler to use and you need less things to connect and pull together a decent production system, creator-driven content is becoming even more and more integral to a marketing campaign. And so not just what they maybe post on their Instagram page or post on LinkedIn, for example, but us as a brand being able to take that content and use that actually in paid media and things like that is all entirely possible because of the overall quality of the content. So that&#39;s something that&#39;s been a trend that&#39;s been in process really, I would say, maybe since the advent of podcasts. But it&#39;s been an evolution. And it&#39;s come a long, long way.

Another thing, and this is really interesting, and this hits home personally, but I remember when I first entered the workforce, and I hope I&#39;m not showing my age too badly here, but I remember the word processing department. And you would write down on a piece of paper, like a memo, and you would give it to the word processing department and somebody would type it up for you. That was a thing. And these days, we&#39;re seeing actually more and more video production with audio, of course, transfer to the actual producers of the content.

In my company, at Shure, we make videos for different purposes to talk about different initiatives or product launches or things that we&#39;re doing just for internal use. And right now, everybody, including our CEO, she makes these videos just at her own desk. She has a little software tool and she can show a PowerPoint and herself and speak to things. And with very, very limited amount of editing, you can put that out there. And I&#39;ve seen friends and colleagues at other companies in very high-level roles just kind of doing their own production. Being able to buy a very high quality microphone with really advanced signal processing built right in, but just plug it in via USB and have it be handled as simply as any consumer device, has made it possible to do really very useful production where you are going to actually sound good and get your message across, but without having to make such a big production out of it, which is kind of cool.

Megan: Yeah. Really democratizes access to sort of creating high quality content, doesn&#39;t it? And of course, no technology discussion is complete without a mention of return on investment, particularly nowadays. Erik, what are some ways companies can get returns on their audio tech investments as well? Where are the most common places you see cost savings?

Erik: Yeah. Well, we collaborated on a study with IDC Research. And they came up with some really interesting findings on this. And one of them was, no surprise, two-thirds or more of companies have taken action on improving their communication and collaboration technology, and even more have additional or initial investments still planned. But the ROI of those initiatives isn&#39;t really tied to the initiative itself. It&#39;s not like when you come out with a new product, you look at how that product performs, and that&#39;s the driver of your ROI. The benefits of smoother collaboration come in the form of shorter meetings, more productive meetings, better decision-making, faster decision-making, stronger teamwork. And so to build an ROI model, what IDC concluded was that you have to build your model to account for those advantages really across the enterprise or across your university, or whatever it may be, and kind of up and down the different set of activities where they&#39;re actually going to be utilized.

So that can be complex. Quantifying things can always be a challenge. But like I said, companies do seem to understand this. And I think that&#39;s because, this is just my hunch, but because everybody, including the CEO and the CFO and the whole finance department, uses and benefits from collaboration technology too. Perhaps that&#39;s one reason why the value is easier to convey. Even if they have not taken the time to articulate things like we&#39;re doing here today, they know when a meeting is good and when it&#39;s not good. And maybe that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s helping companies to justify these investments. But it&#39;s always tricky to do ROI on projects like that. But again, focusing on the broader benefits of collaboration and breaking it down into what it means for specific activities and types of meetings, I think, is the way to go about doing that.

Megan: Absolutely. And Brian, what kinds of advancements are you seeing in the lab that perhaps one day might contribute to those cost savings?

Brian: Well, I don&#39;t know anything about cost savings, Megan. I&#39;m a college professor. I live a pure life of the mind.

Brian: ROI does not compute for me. No, I would say we are in an extremely exciting frontier right now because of AI and many different technologies. The studies that we talked about earlier, in one sense, they were broad. We explored many different traits from dating to hiring to credibility. And we isolated them in all sorts of ways we didn&#39;t talk about. We showed that it wasn&#39;t due to overall affect or pessimism or something like that. But in those studies, we really only tested one very particular set of dimensions along which an audio signal can vary, which is some sort of model of clarity. But in reality, the audio signal is so multi-dimensional. And as we&#39;re getting more and more tools these days, we can not only change audio along the lines of clarity, as we&#39;ve been talking about, but we can potentially manipulate it in all sorts of ways.

We&#39;re very interested in pushing these studies forward and in exploring how people&#39;s sort of brute impressions that they make are affected by all sorts of things. Meg and Erik, we walk around the world all the time making these judgments about people, right? You meet someone and you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I could really be friends with them. They seem like a great person.&quot; And you know that you&#39;re making that judgment, but you have no idea why, right? It just seems kind of intuitive. Well, in an audio signal, when you&#39;re talking to someone, you can think of, &quot;What if their signal is more bass heavy? What if it&#39;s a little more treble heavy? What if we manipulate it in this way? In that way?&quot;

When we talked about the faculty meeting that motivated this whole research program, I mentioned that my colleague, who was speaking from his home recording studio, he actually didn&#39;t sound clear like in real life. He sounded better than in real life. He sounded like he was all around us. What is the implication of that? I think there&#39;s so many different dimensions of an audio signal that we&#39;re just being able to readily control and manipulate that it&#39;s going to be very exciting to see how all of these sorts of things impact our impressions of each other.

Megan: And there may be some overlap with this as well, but I wondered if we could close with a future forward look, Brian. What are you looking forward to in emerging audio technology? What are some exciting opportunities on the horizon, perhaps related to what you were just talking about there?

Brian: Well, we&#39;re interested in studying this from a scientific perspective. Erik, you talked about how when you started. When I started doing this science, we didn&#39;t have a word processing department. We had a stone tablet department. But I hear tell that the current generation, when they send photos back and forth to each other, that they, as a matter, of course, they apply all sorts of filters-

Brian: ... to those video signals, those video or just photographic signals. We&#39;re all familiar with that. That hasn&#39;t quite happened with the audio signals yet, but I think that&#39;s coming up as well. You can imagine that you record yourself saying a little message and then you filter it this way or that way. And that&#39;s going to become the Wild West about the kinds of impressions we make on each other, especially if and when you don&#39;t know that those filters have been operating in the first place.

Megan: That&#39;s so interesting. Erik, what are you looking forward to in audio technology as well?

Erik: Well, I&#39;m still thinking about what Brian said.

Erik: I have to go back again. I&#39;ll go back to the past, maybe 15 to 20 years. And I remember at work, we had meeting rooms with the Starfish phones in the middle of the table. And I remember that we would have international meetings with our partners there that were selling our products in different countries, including in Japan and in China, and the people actually in our own company in those countries. We knew the time zone was bad. And we knew that English wasn&#39;t their native language, and tried to be as courteous as possible with written materials and things like that. But I went over to China, and I had to actually be on the other end of one of those calls. And I&#39;m a native English speaker, or at least a native Chicago dialect of American English speaker. And really understanding how challenging it was for them to participate in those meetings just hit me right between the eyes.

We&#39;ve come so far, which is wonderful. But I think of a scenario, and this is not far off, there are many companies working on this right now, where not only can you get a real time captioning in your native language, no matter what the language of the participant, you can actually hear the person who&#39;s speaking&#39;s voice manipulated into your native language.

I&#39;m never going to be a fluent Japanese or Chinese speaker, that&#39;s for sure. But I love the thought that I could actually talk with people and they could understand me as though I were speaking their native language, and that they could communicate to me and I could understand them in the way that they want to be understood. I think there&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together. Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

Megan: Gosh, that sounds absolutely fascinating. Thank you both so much for such an interesting discussion.

Meet the new biologists treating LLMs like aliens

How large is a large language model? We now coexist with machines so vast and so complicated that nobody quite understands what they are, how they work, or what they can really do—not even the people who build them.That’s a problem. Even though nobody fully understands how it works—and thus exactly what its limitations might be—hundreds of millions of people now use this technology every day.

To help overcome our ignorance, researchers are studying LLMs as if they were doing biology or neuroscience on vast living creatures—city-size xenomorphs that have appeared in our midst. And they’re discovering that large language models are even weirder than they thought. Read the full story.—Will Douglas Heaven

Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon

The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent.

Canavero may have withdrawn from the spotlight, but the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.

            <h2>Rainbow Weather raises $5.5M to refine real-time weather forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What: The European Commission unveiled EU Inc (“28th regime”), a single EU-wide legal company structure designed to let startups incorporate once and operate across all member states.
Who it affects: European startups & scale-ups, founders, VCs, international investors.
How: Reduces legal fragmentation, standardises corporate and investment structures, lowers friction for cross-border scaling.
Impact timing: Strategic impact now (capital & expectations), real operational impact from 2027–2028.

What: The EU proposed mandatory rules to remove and replace technology from suppliers deemed “high-risk” in telecoms and other critical networks.
Who it affects: Telecom operators, infrastructure providers, governments, Chinese tech vendors, cybersecurity supply chains.
How: Forces equipment replacement, raises capex, hardens security requirements across Europe.
Impact timing: Immediate policy impact, execution over the next few years.

What: European institutions publicly backed a strategy to reduce reliance on US technology across cloud, software, semiconductors and AI, often referred to as building a European “tech stack.”
Who it affects: US hyperscalers, European cloud & AI companies, policymakers, public procurement.
How: Shapes future regulation, funding priorities and government tech buying decisions.
Impact timing: Political and strategic impact now, regulatory and market impact medium-term.

This week wasn’t about hype:
EU Inc sets the future structure, high-risk tech phase-out enforces security now, and tech sovereignty defines Europe’s direction.

            <h2>Mews raises €255M to accelerate AI and automation in hospitality</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/mews-raises-e255m-to-accelerate-ai-and-automation-in-hospitality">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.
