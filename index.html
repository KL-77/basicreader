            <div id="article-text">Sure, most Americans are glued to their TVs for the today’s Super Bowl and/or the Winter Olympics. But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space.

As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise:

Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone.

In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky.

To say there’s a lot of interest in this movie might be an understatement. The first trailer was released in June and racked up a whopping 400 million views worldwide in its first week. The footage—which included Ryland discovering an alien ship inhabited by the aforementioned Rocky—gave every indication of following Weir’s novel pretty closely. That’s very good news for Weir fans, which includes several of us here at Ars.

That earlier trailer mostly gave us a lot of backstory about how Ryland ended up reluctantly agreeing to the mission, with just a few glimpses of Rocky. But Rocky is front and center for this latest one. The footage focuses on how Ryland and Rocky learn to communicate and gradually bond over their shared fates, with strains of Prince’s “I Would Die For You” echoing in the background. It starts with Rocky imitating Ryland’s body motions, including a goofy hero pose. Eventually Ryland figures out how to synthesize and voice for Rocky so they can better coordinate their strategies. Will they succeed? Or is this a one-way trip for one or both of them?

Project Hail Mary hits theaters on March 20, 2026.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group.

By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.

Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.

“Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.

The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump.

From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration.

At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment.

Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.

Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures.

“Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a Dec. 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices.

Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote.

Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode.

Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators.

One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action.

“But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.”

Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021.

The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report.

However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email.

Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads.

Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report.

“We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.”

The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters.

Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added.

“Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known-good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some of have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased, but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/randomly-quoting-ray-bradbury-did-not-save-lawyer-from-losing-case-over-ai-errors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frustrated by fake citations and flowery prose packed with “out-of-left-field” references to ancient libraries and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a New York federal judge took the rare step of terminating a case this week due to a lawyer’s repeated misuse of AI when drafting filings.

In an order on Thursday, district judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations.

One of those filings was “noteworthy,” Failla said, “for its conspicuously florid prose.” Where some of Feldman’s filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically.

It featured, the judge noted, “an extended quote from Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and metaphors comparing legal advocacy to gardening and the leaving of indelible ‘mark[s] upon the clay.’” The Bradbury quote is below:

“Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”

Another passage Failla highlighted as “raising the Court’s eyebrows” curiously invoked a Bible passage about divine judgment as a means of acknowledging the lawyer’s breach of duty in not catching the fake citations:

“Your Honor, in the ancient libraries of Ashurbanipal, scribes carried their stylus as both tool and sacred trust—understanding that every mark upon clay would endure long beyond their mortal span. As the role the mark (x) in Ezekiel Chapter 9, that marked the foreheads with a tav (x) of blood and ink, bear the same solemn recognition: that the written word carries power to preserve or condemn, to build or destroy, and leaves an indelible mark which cannot be erased but should be withdrawn, let it lead other to think these citations were correct.

I have failed in that sacred trust. The errors in my memorandum, however inadvertent, have diminished the integrity of the record and the dignity of these proceedings. Like the scribes of antiquity who bore their stylus as both privilege and burden, I understand that legal authorship demands more than mere competence—it requires absolute fidelity to truth and precision in every mark upon the page.”

Although the judge believed the “florid prose” signaled that a chatbot wrote the draft, Feldman denied that. In a hearing transcript in which the judge weighed possible sanctions, Feldman testified that he wrote every word of the filings. He explained that he read the Bradbury book “many years ago” and wanted to include “personal things” in that filing. And as for his references to Ashurbanipal, that also “came from me,” he said.

Instead of admitting he had let an AI draft his filings, he maintained that his biggest mistake was relying on various AI programs to review and cross-check citations. Among the tools that he admitted using included Paxton AI, vLex’s Vincent AI, and Google’s NotebookLM. Essentially, he testified that he substituted three rounds of AI review for one stretch reading through all the cases he was citing. That misstep allowed hallucinations and fake citations to creep into the filings, he said.

But the judge pushed back, writing in her order that it was “extremely difficult to believe” that AI did not draft those sections containing overwrought prose. She accused Feldman of dodging the truth.

“The Court sees things differently: AI generated this citation from the start, and Mr. Feldman’s decision to remove most citations and write ‘more of a personal letter&#39;” is “nothing but an ex post justification that seeks to obscure his misuse of AI and his steadfast refusal to review his submissions for accuracy,” Failla wrote.

At the hearing, she expressed frustration and annoyance at Feldman for evading her questions and providing inconsistent responses. Eventually, he testified that he used AI to correct information when drafting one of the filings, which Failla immediately deemed “unwise,” but not the one quoting Bradbury.

Feldman is one of hundreds of lawyers who have relied on AI to draft filings, which have introduced fake citations into cases. Lawyers have offered a wide range of excuses for relying too much on AI. Some have faced small fines, around $150, while others have been slapped with thousands in fines, including one case where sanctions reached $85,000 for repeated, abusive misconduct. At least one law firm has threatened to fire lawyers citing fake cases, and other lawyers have imposed other voluntary sanctions, like taking a yearlong leave of absence.

Seemingly, Feldman did not think sanctions were warranted in this case. In his defense of three filings containing 14 errors out of 60 total citations, Feldman discussed his challenges accessing legal databases due to high subscription costs and short library hours. With more than one case on his plate and his kids’ graduations to attend, he struggled to verify citations during times when he couldn’t make it to the library, he testified. As a workaround, he relied on several AI programs to verify citations that he found by searching on tools like Google Scholar.

Feldman likely did not expect the judge to terminate the case as a result of his AI misuses. Asked how he thought the court should resolve things, Feldman suggested that he could correct the filings by relying on other attorneys to review citations, while avoiding “any use whatsoever of any, you know, artificial intelligence or LLM type of methods.” The judge, however, wrote that his repeated misuses were “proof” that he “learned nothing” and had not implemented voluntary safeguards to catch the errors.

Asked for comment, Feldman told Ars that he did not have time to discuss the sanctions but that he hopes his experience helps raise awareness of how inaccessible court documents are to the public. “Use of AI, and the ability to improve it, exposes a deeper proxy fight over whether law and serious scholarship remain publicly auditable, or drift into closed, intermediary‑controlled systems that undermine verification and due process,” Feldman suggested.

“The real lesson is about transparency and system design, not simply tool failure,” Feldman said.

But at the hearing, Failla said that she thinks Feldman had “access to the walled garden” of legal databases, if only he “would go to the law library” to do his research, rather than rely on AI tools.

“It sounds like you want me to say that you should be absolved of all of these terrible citation errors, these missed citations, because you don’t have Westlaw,” the judge said. “But now I know you have access to Westlaw. So what do you want?”

As Failla explained in her order, she thinks the key takeaway is that Feldman routinely failed to catch his own errors. She said that she has no problem with lawyers using AI to assist their research, but Feldman admitted to not reading the cases that he cited and “apparently” cannot “learn from his mistakes.”

Verifying case citations should never be a job left to AI, Failla said, describing Feldman’s research methods as “redolent of Rube Goldberg.”

“Most lawyers simply call this ‘conducting legal research,’” Failla wrote. “All lawyers must know how to do it. Mr. Feldman is not excused from this professional obligation by dint of using emerging technology.”

His “explanations were thick on words but thin on substance,” the judge wrote. She concluded that he “repeatedly and brazenly” violated Rule 11, which requires attorneys to verify the cases that they cite, “despite multiple warnings.”

Noting that Feldman “failed to fully accept responsibility,” she ruled that case-terminating sanctions were necessary, entering default judgment for the plaintiffs. Feldman may also be on the hook to pay fees for wasting other attorneys’ time.

The hearing transcript has circulated on social media due to the judge’s no-nonsense approach to grilling Feldman, whom she clearly found evasive and lacking credibility.

“Look, if you don’t want to be straight with me, if you don’t want to answer questions with candor, that’s fine,” Failla said. “I’ll just make my own decisions about what I think you did in this case. I’m giving you an opportunity to try and explain something that I think cannot be explained.”

In her order this week, she noted that Feldman “struggled to make eye contact” and left the court without “clear answers.”

Feldman’s errors came in a case in which a toy company sued merchants who allegedly failed to stop selling stolen goods after receiving a cease-and-desist order. His client was among the merchants accused of illegally profiting from the alleged thefts. They faced federal charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, as well as New York charges, including fostering the sale of stolen goods.

The loss triggers remedies, including an injunction preventing additional sales of stolen goods and refunding every customer who bought them. Feldman’s client must also turn over any stolen goods in their remaining inventory and disgorge profits. Other damages may be owed, along with interest. Ars could not immediately reach an attorney for the plaintiffs to discuss the sanctions order or resulting remedies.

Failla emphasized in her order that Feldman appeared to not appreciate “the gravity of the situation,” repeatedly submitting filings with fake citations even after he had been warned that sanctions could be ordered.

That was a choice, Failla said, noting that Feldman’s mistakes were caught early by a lawyer working for another defendant in the case, Joel MacMull, who urged Feldman to promptly notify the court. The whole debacle would have ended in June 2025, MacMull suggested at the hearing.

Rather than take MacMull’s advice, however, Feldman delayed notifying the court, irking the judge. He testified during the heated sanctions hearing that the delay was due to an effort he quietly undertook, working to correct the filing. He supposedly planned to submit those corrections when he alerted the court to the errors.

But Failla noted that he never submitted corrections, insisting instead that Feldman kept her “in the dark.”

“There’s no real reason why you should have kept this from me,” the judge said.

The court learned of the fake citations only after MacMull notified the judge by sharing emails of his attempts to get Feldman to act urgently. Those emails showed Feldman scolding MacMull for unprofessional conduct after MacMull refused to check Feldman’s citations for him, which Failla noted at the hearing was absolutely not MacMull’s responsibility.

Feldman told Failla that he also thought it was unprofessional for MacMull to share their correspondence, but Failla said the emails were “illuminative.”

At the hearing, MacMull asked if the court would allow him to seek payment of his fees, since he believes “there has been a multiplication of proceedings here that would have been entirely unnecessary if Mr. Feldman had done what I asked him to do that Sunday night in June.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open source packages published on the npm and PyPI repositories were laced with code that stole wallet credentials from dYdX developers and backend systems and, in some cases, backdoored devices, researchers said.

“Every application using the compromised npm versions is at risk ….” the researchers, from security firm Socket, said Friday. “Direct impact includes complete wallet compromise and irreversible cryptocurrency theft. The attack scope includes all applications depending on the compromised versions and both developers testing with real credentials and production end-users.”

dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that supports hundreds of markets for “perpetual trading,” or the use of cryptocurrency to bet that the value of a derivative future will rise or fall. Socket said dYdX has processed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume over its lifetime, with an average trading volume of $200 million to $540 million and roughly $175 million in open interest. The exchange provides code libraries that allow third-party apps for trading bots, automated strategies, or backend services, all of which handle mnemonics or private keys for signing.

The npm malware embedded a malicious function in the legitimate package. When a seed phrase that underpins wallet security was processed, the function exfiltrated it, along with a fingerprint of the device running the app. The fingerprint allowed the threat actor to correlate stolen credentials to track victims across multiple compromises. The domain receiving the seed was dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site, which mimics the legitimate dYdX service at dydx[.]xyz through typosquatting.

The malicious code available on PyPI contained the same credential theft function, although it also implemented a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allowed the execution of new malware on infected systems. The backdoor received commands from dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site. The domain was registered on January 9, 17 days before the malicious package was uploaded to PyPI.

Socket said the packages were published to npm and PyPI by official dYdX accounts, an indication that they were compromised and used by the attackers. dYdX officials didn’t respond to an email seeking confirmation and additional details.

The incident is at least the third time dYdX has been targeted in attacks. Previous events include a September 2022 uploading of malicious code to the npm repository and the commandeering in 2024 of the dYdX v3 website through DNS hijacking. Users were redirected to a malicious site that prompted them to sign transactions designed to drain their wallets.

“Viewed alongside the 2022 npm supply chain compromise and the 2024 DNS hijacking incident, this [latest] attack highlights a persistent pattern of adversaries targeting dYdX-related assets through trusted distribution channels,” Socket said. “The threat actor simultaneously compromised packages in both npm and PyPI ecosystems, expanding the attack surface to reach JavaScript and Python developers working with dYdX.”

Anyone using the platform should carefully examine all apps for dependencies on the malicious packages listed above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.

According to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.

“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”

Five hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.

“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.

The subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.

“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.

As DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.

“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”

When uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.

When Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”

“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”

Credit where it’s due, though: Google delayed handing over Jon’s data long enough for the ACLU to challenge the subpoena on his behalf, though it didn’t explain why. Of course, that meant DHS agents still tracked down his address some other way — part of a growing trend of federal agencies surveilling and harassing random people who haven’t even been arrested, let alone convicted of a crime.

            <h2>GLP-1s Are an Environmental Catastrophe</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs have become an enormously popular way to lose weight. And with generic, much cheaper versions of the medications on the horizon, their use could soon grow even further.

But apart from being a clinically proven way to shed pounds — at least temporarily — along with a whole constellation of other health benefits, the drugs also turn out to be a major strain on the environment.

As detailed in a new paper published in the journal Nature Sustainability, researchers from the University of Melbourne investigated how the process of producing peptides — short chains of amino acids that aren’t just used for GLP-1 agonists, but plenty of other drugs and treatments as well — releases huge amounts of organic solvents and other plastic byproducts that don’t break down on their own in nature.

Fortunately, the researchers say they’ve come up with a much more environmentally friendly procedure that could make producing peptide-based treatments far more sustainable in the long-run.

So far, they’ve been manufactured using a technique called “solid phase peptide synthesis,” or SPPS, which anchors the first amino acid building block to a synthetic resin, such as polystyrene beads. Toxic solvents — including dimethylformamide, a component of paint strippers — are then used to add each amino acid one by one, which can then leak into the water supply.

The scale of the issue is considerable. As the lead author of the Nature Sustainability paper and University of Melbourne chemistry professor John Wade wrote in a piece about his research, the annual production of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight loss drugs such as Ozempic, is currently generating upwards of 123 million pounds of toxic solvent waste. And that’s just one of more than 80 peptide-based drugs on the market.

The materials involved are also expensive and difficult to get rid of, thanks to tight environmental regulations.

“Why are we still making life-saving medicines using chemical processes that produce mountains of toxic waste, and could water — the cleanest and most familiar solvent of all — offer a way out?” Wade asked rhetorically.

In response, the researcher and his colleagues came up with a water-based solution to synthesize peptides. By pairing amino acids with specific salts, they found they could overcome limitations associated with SPPS, allowing them to dissolve them in water “at high concentrations while remaining fully functional.”

An activating agent combined with a biodegradable material could allow for “efficient peptide synthesis entirely in water,” the professor argued.

It remains to be seen whether the process can be scaled up industrially, but given the wide proliferation of GLP-1 agonists, it’s critical to investigate ways of making manufacturing processes more sustainable.

“What began as a shared concern among three long-time international collaborators has become an exciting technology with the potential to reshape how some of the most important medicines of our time are made,” Wade wrote. “Cleanly, responsibly and ready for the future.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jeffrey Epstein had a bizarre obsession with genetics and “improving” human DNA — and he was corresponding with top scientists to make his fantasies a reality.

The newly released documents from the Justice Department shine additional light on how the convicted child sex criminal exhibited a fascination with transhumanism, a controversial movement in science and philosophy with a eugenicist mission: using cutting edge technology, including genetic engineering and AI, to advance the biology of the human race. They also reinforce how serious Epstein was about pursuing these ideas, which he tossed around among his shockingly wide network of intellectuals, many of whom communicated with him long after he had pled guilty to child prostitution charges in 2008.

To ingratiate himself with top scientists, the deceased billionaire offered to fund their research and held expensive research conferences and parties. In 2006, he organized a conference on St Thomas in the British Virgin Islands — not far from his notorious “Epstein Island” — attended by luminaries including physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne. Even though the subject was supposed to be about the theory of gravity, the New York Times reported that one attendee recalled that all Epstein wanted to talk about was improving the human genome, and how the passing of certain traits might result in superior humans.

Epstein harbored myriad racist beliefs, including the idea that Black people’s genetics made them less intelligent. In 2016, Epstein emailed German cognitive scientist and then-MIT-professor Joscha Bach, indicating that he was interested in the idea of genetically modifying Black people to make them “smarter,” The Telegraph found. Bach had received a roughly $400,000 donation from Epstein. In a 2016 email exchange with leftist thinker Noam Chomsky, Epstein claimed that “the test score gap amongst African Americans is well documented,” and was adamant that a “set of genes used for working memory” could be “found and adjusted.”

Epstein also wanted to invest in research pursuing genetically modifying embryos to produce children with desirable traits, The Telegraph also spotted. He seriously entertained the idea in a 2018 email exchange — Subject: “Designer babies” — with crypto entrepreneur Bryan Bishop, who asked Epstein about securing funding. “i have no issue with investing,” Epstein responded.

As it happened, Epstein wanted children of his own — and lots of them. The 2019 NYT reporting details how Epstein had planned to “seed” the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his 33,000 square-foot ranch in New Mexico, and discussed the idea with multiple top scientists (who chose to remain anonymous). One of the scientists allegedly claimed that Epstein wanted to impregnate 20 women at a time.

Epstein also had a creepy obsession with using genetics to improve women’s sex drives. He repeatedly discussed the idea with former Stanford human biology professor Nathan Wolfe in email exchanges between 2008 and 2013, Stanford Daily found, in which they mused over the possibility of developing a “female viagra.”

Wolfe, perhaps even more so than Epstein, was serious about making it happen. In May 2013, he wrote to Epstein enthusing that their “horny virus hypothesis” could be correct. He claimed that he’d come up with a study “directly linking sexual behavior and microbial diversity,” and asked for Epstein’s thoughts about his “funding on this hypothesis.”

“I think it hits the sweet spot of what we’ve been thinking about (so to speak),” Wolfe added.

Another scientist that Epstein confided with was Martin Nowak, a math and biology professor at Harvard University. Nowak was known for his work on using mathematics to describe the evolution of the human language and how certain human behaviors emerged. In light of everything above, it’s not hard to see why Epstein took such a strong interest in his work: in 2003, the billionaire donated $30 million to Harvard to support Nowak’s research.

Nowak’s connection to Epstein is well documented. But the newly released documents additionally revealed an ominous sounding email to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s partner — and alleged partner in crime. “i am so very sorry i caused you so much worry and that i spoilt this day. i am so happy that i did not kill anybody,” he wrote in a 2002 email. “my perspective of life has changed somehow.” In 2014, Epstein sent a cryptic email to Nowak stating, “our spy was captured after completing her mission.” Nowak responded: “did you torture her.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plenty of asteroids can survive their fiery plunge through the Earth’s atmosphere. If they’re big enough, they can prove incredibly destructive, like the 60-foot Chelyabinsk meteor that exploded over the southern Ural region in Russia in 2013, releasing a blast equivalent to 30 times the energy of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.

And in case an even larger space rock were to ever threaten humanity, we’d have to get creative to keep it from colliding with our planet. Crashing a spacecraft into it like a pool ball to redirect its path — just like NASA did with its proof of concept Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission in 2022 — may not always be on the table, given the many uncertainties involved.

In a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications, an international team of researchers — including scientists from CERN and the University of Oxford — revisited the idea of blowing up an incoming asteroid with a nuclear warhead.

There are intuitive concerns. What if the asteroid shattered, turning a cosmic sniper shot into a shotgun blast of debris raining down over our planet?

But the team used CERN’s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to study how asteroid materials react to different levels of physical stress, including large-scale simulations of nuclear deflection, and found that the space rocks are surprisingly resilient.

“Planetary defense represents a scientific challenge,” said Karl-Georg Schlesinger, cofounder of nuclear deflection startup Outer Solar System Company (OuSoCo), which partnered with the scientists, in a statement. “The world must be able to execute a nuclear deflection mission with high confidence, yet cannot conduct a real-world test in advance.”

In an experiment, the team exposed samples of a metal-rich meteorite to 27 short but intense pulses of a proton beam at CERN’s HiRadMat facility. Afterward, the team moved the meteorite to the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK to analyze changes to its internal structure at a microscopic level.

To their surprise, the “material became stronger, exhibiting an increase in yield strength, and displayed a self-stabilizing damping behavior,” explained OuSoCo cofounder Melanie Bochmann.

The finding could have major implications for how we approach future asteroid redirection efforts.

“Our experiments indicate that — at least for metal-rich asteroid material — a larger device than previously thought can be used without catastrophically breaking the asteroid,” Bochmann said. “This keeps open an emergency option for situations involving very large objects or very short warning times, where non-nuclear methods are insufficient and where current models might assume fragmentation would limit the usable device size.”

Fortunately, the researchers could soon have far more data to go by. Both NASA and the European Space Agency are planning to study Apophis, an enormous asteroid somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 feet in width, which is expected to come eerily close to the Earth — closer than many geosynchronous satellites at just 20,000 miles — to Earth in April 2029.

“As a next step, we plan to study more complex and rocky asteroid materials,” the researchers said in a statement. “One example is a class of meteorites called pallasites, which consist of a metal matrix similar to the meteorite material we have already studied, with up to centimeter-sized magnesium-rich crystals embedded inside.”

The upcoming research could have fascinating implications outside of asteroid redirection as well.

“Because these objects are thought to originate from the core–mantle boundary of early planetesimals,” they added, “such experiments could also provide valuable insights into planetary formation processes.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Suspicious as the circumstances surrounding his death may have been, there’s a broad consensus that Jeffrey Epstein did in fact die in 2019.

Unless, that is, you’re the type of person that believes everything you see on X, in which case the convicted child sex offender is alive and well in Israel, where he spends his free time pubstomping scrubs in Fortnite.

This appears to be something people actually believe, stemming from the discovery of what might be Epstein’s YouTube account in the latest batch of files. A receipt sent to his email for a movie purchased on the platform — Alfred Hitchcock’s “Frenzy” — revealed the username “littlestjeff1.” Amateur sleuths then discovered a Fortnite account with the same account name, which online trackers showed was based in Israel and active as recently as 2025. Conspiracy theories ensued, going viral on X.

So Epstein is still among the living? Not according to Fortnite’s team, which says this is just some prankster’s idea of a sick joke.

“Hey Official Fortnite here — this was a ruse by a Fortnite player,” the account said. “A few days ago, an existing Fortnite account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube. These Fortnite trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it.”

“We have no record of the subject’s email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system,” the statement added. “Since the public document releases, people have created Fortnite accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”

The conspiracy theorists were perhaps fueled by Epstein’s apparent ties to the Israeli government, including frequent correspondence with former prime minister and minister of defense Ehud Barak. And not backing down from the official Fortnite narrative, they claim that one of the files shows a receipt of Epstein purchasing V-Bucks, Fortnite’s in-game currency, in 2019.

But that isn’t the case. There appears to be only one reference to V-Bucks in the files, and it’s an email with a redacted sender and recipient sent in May 2019 clarifying that there was a $25.95 charge for the Fortnite currency. And it’s referenced as “VBucks,” not its proper hyphenated name. The email is not an actual receipt, and it doesn’t show it was sent to Epstein.

“Someone’s been having fun renaming their Fortnite account,” wrote Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, “but it’s recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive.”

What’s more interesting than this latest conspiracy theory is the fact that Fortnite felt compelled to clear the air at all — a sure sign of how high-strung everyone is feeling about Epstein’s wide web of deep connections.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At $175 billion, Donald Trump’s Golden Dome missile defense system already came with an astonishing price tag. Yet according to one new analysis by the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, that early estimate could be a drop in the bucket compared to an actual cost so high the Golden Dome simply “will not work.”

To come to that conclusion, the new analysis compiled various reports from expert sources. One of them, conducted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, suggests that taxpayers could spend $3.6 trillion on the Golden Dome over the next 20 years, or $4.4 trillion adjusted for expected inflation.

To put this in perspective, if we pooled all the physical money together in the US, it still wouldn’t be enough. Including currency outside the US Treasury and Federal Reserve Banks, there’s currently $2.43 trillion floating around the US — a far cry from what we’d need.

That’s not even assuming worst case scenario; shooting rockets out of the sky is an incredibly convoluted engineering challenge, after all. To even sniff an interceptor success rate “very close to 100 percent,” the AEI suggests just the space-based interceptors (SBI’s) — orbital counter-ordinance, essentially — could cost as much as $6 trillion on their own.

Under the $6 trillion scenario, the AEI estimates the US Space Force could field as many as 85,400 SBIs. That’s a lot of infrastructure, and it assumes a generous ratio of real-world success, where it only takes a handful of SBIs to knock out each adversarial rocket.

According to the American Physical Society Panel on Public Affairs’ February report, the amount of SBIs required to knock out just one adversarial rocket could really be in the hundreds, assuming we’re shooting down last-gen missiles. Next-gen solid state intercontintental ballistic missiles, however, could require “at least 1600 interceptors” per missile.

Given that Trump’s geopolitical rivals, China and Russia, may have 750 ICBMs between them at the moment, we’re talking 1.2 million SBIs worth of ordinance to assure security. (That’s before we even mention the hundreds of cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons in play.)

“If Golden Dome could guarantee our security for nuclear weapons, one could argue that these astronomical costs would be worth it, but from all these viability problems and the history of failed attempts, it’s very clear that it won’t,” Gabe Murphy, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense told the Federal News Network.

Indeed, even if there was enough money to pay for the defense project, there’s still a fundamental problem: in over 40 years of missile defense research, technicians have only knocked one mock warhead out of the sky. That, we think, just about says it all.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a better-than-expected opening weekend in theaters, box office for Amazon’s “Melania” fell 67%, to an estimated $2.37 million, in its second weekend.

The documentary about First Melania Trump has grossed a total of $13.5 million so far (almost all of that in the United States), which means it’s extremely unlikely the film — which Amazon spent $40 million to acquire and $35 million to market — will break even in theaters.

Before “Melania”’s release, a former Amazon film executive asked how the price tag could be motivated by anything other than “currying favor” with the Trump administration or “an outright bribe.”

Moviegoing typically slows during Super Bowl weekend, but the weekend’s top film, “Send Help,” only declined 47%. And after placing third on the charts last weekend, “Melania” is ninth this time.

Perhaps anticipating discussion about the film’s decline, Amazon released a statement from its head of domestic theatrical distribution Kevin Wilson, who said, “Together, theatrical and streaming represent two distinct value creating moments that amplify the film’s overall impact.”

“Melania” received universally negative reviews from critics, but its 99% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes was so good that the site put out a statement insisting that the score was real.

            <div id="article-text">Just in time to create a new Super Bowl ad, Crypto.com founder Kris Marszalek has made the priciest domain purchase in history, buying AI.com for $70 million, according to the Financial Times. The deal, paid entirely in cryptocurrency to an unknown seller, shatters previous records. (Broker Larry Fischer, who facilitated the sale, is presumably celebrating his good fortune.)

Marszalek plans to debut the site during Sunday’s big game, offering consumers a personal AI agent for messaging, app usage, and stock trading. “If you take a long-term view — 10 to 20 years – [AI] is going to be one of the greatest technological waves of our lifetime,” he told the FT.

The purchase rewrites the domain record books — not that crypto industry itself is known for its restraint when it comes to spending. Previously, CarInsurance.com held the crown at $49.7 million (2010), followed by VacationRentals.com ($35 million in 2007) and Voice.com ($30 million in 2019). Other eye-popping sales include PrivateJet.com ($30 million), 360.com ($17 million), and Sex.com, which has sold twice for over $13 million each time, though its second owner went bankrupt trying to monetize it.

“With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes,” Fischer told the FT. “When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.”

Whether these mega-dollar domains actually deliver returns remains an open question. But for Marszalek, who already owns Crypto.com and dropped $700 million on stadium naming rights, owning two category-defining domains is apparently worth the outlay.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/08/okay-im-slightly-less-mad-about-that-magnificent-ambersons-ai-project/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a startup announced plans last fall to recreate lost footage from Orson Welles’ classic film “The Magnificent Ambersons” using generative AI, I was skeptical. More than that, I was baffled why anyone would spend time and money on something that seemed guaranteed to outrage cinephiles while offering negligible commercial value.

This week, an in-depth profile by the New Yorker’s Michael Schulman provides more details about the project. If nothing else, it helps explain why the startup Fable and its founder Edward Saatchi are pursuing it: It seems to come from a genuine love of Welles and his work.

Saatchi (whose father was a founder of advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi) recalled a childhood of watching films in a private screening room with his “movie mad” parents. He said he first saw “Ambersons” when he was twelve.

The profile also explains why “Ambersons,” while much less famous than Welles’ first film “Citizen Kane,” remains so tantalizing — Welles himself claimed it was a “much better picture” than “Kane,” but after a disastrous preview screening, the studio cut 43 minutes from the film, added an abrupt and unconvincing happy ending, and eventually destroyed the excised footage to make space in its vaults.

“To me, this is the holy grail of lost cinema,” Saatchi said. “It just seemed intuitively that there would be some way to undo what had happened.”

Saatchi is only the latest Welles devotee to dream of recreating the lost footage. In fact, Fable is working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who already spent years trying to achieve the same thing with animated scenes based on the movie’s script and photographs, and on Welles’ notes. (Rose said that after he screened the results for friends and family, “a lot of them were scratching their heads.”)

So while Fable is using more advanced technology — filming scenes in live action, then eventually overlaying them with digital recreations of the original actors and their voices — this project is best understood as a slicker, better-funded version of Rose’s work. It’s a fan’s attempt to glimpse Welles’ vision.

Notably, while the New Yorker article includes a few clips of Rose’s animations, as well as images of Fable’s AI actors, there’s no footage showing the results of Fable’s live action-AI hybrid.

By the company’s own admission, there are significant challenges, whether that’s fixing obvious blunders like a two-headed version of the actor Joseph Cotten, or the more subjective task of recreating the complex beauty of the film’s cinematography. (Saatchi even described a “happiness” problem, with the AI tending to make the film’s women look inappropriately happy.)

As for whether this footage will ever be released to the public, Saatchi admitted it was “a total mistake” not to speak to Welles’ estate before his announcement. Since then, he has reportedly been working to win over both the estate and Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the film. Welles’ daughter Beatrice told Schulman that while she remains “skeptical,” she now believes “they are going into this project with enormous respect toward my father and this beautiful movie.”

The actor and biographer Simon Callow — who’s currently writing the fourth book in his multi-volume Welles biography — has also agreed to advise the project, which he described as a “great idea.” (Callow is a family friend of the Saatchis.)

But not everyone has been convinced. Melissa Galt said her mother, the actress Anne Baxter, would “not have agreed with that at all.”

“It’s not the truth,” Galt said. “It’s a creation of someone else’s truth. But it’s not the original, and she was a purist.”

And while I’ve become more sympathetic to Saatchi’s aims, I still agree with Galt: At its best, this project will only result in a novelty, a dream of what the movie might have been.

In fact, Galt’s description of her mother’s position that “once the movie was done, it was done,” reminded me of a recent essay in which the writer Aaron Bady compared AI to the vampires in “Sinners.” Bady argued that when it comes to art, both vampires and AI will always come up short, because “what makes art possible” is a knowledge of mortality and limitations.

“There is no work of art without an ending, without the point at which the work ends (even if the world continues),” he wrote, adding, “Without death, without loss, and without the space between my body and yours, separating my memories from yours, we cannot make art or desire or feeling.”

In that light, Saatchi’s insistence that there must be “some way to undo what had happened” feels, if not outright vampiric, then at least a little childish in its unwillingness to accept that some losses are permanent. It may not, perhaps, be all that different from a startup founder claiming they can make grief obsolete — or a studio executive insisting that “The Magnificent Ambersons” needed a happy ending.

Waymo’s acceleration over the past 18 months is undeniable. The Alphabet-owned self-driving company now operates commercial robotaxi services in six markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami. It has plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo.

And now it has $16 billion to fuel that expansion. Is it enough?

Talking to a few industry watchers, the answer kept landing in the squishy “sort of” and “it depends” territory.

First the bull case. Alphabet is clearly committed to ensuring Waymo’s success; the parent company is, and continues to be, the primary investor. Which means Waymo isn’t exposed like other AV startups that suddenly lost funding after their backers (often legacy automakers) got skittish or pivoted.

Its ridership and autonomous miles driven stats are also exploding and will likely continue in that trajectory unless it is derailed by regulators. (Waymo provides 400,000 rides every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas, and in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides.)

This doesn’t guarantee success, though, especially if the gauge is set to profitability. Waymo still must solve several problems, including cost and increasing attention from regulators (the company’s chief safety officer just testified in a Senate Commerce hearing). If Waymo wants to simply be the licensor of its AV tech, it will have to move away from being the operator, which means giving up some control. That’s hard with a nascent technology under scrutiny.

And while some of you will fight me on this, it also lacks the in-house manufacturing that Tesla has. Yes, Waymo has automotive partners. But it doesn’t come with the same financial leverage or ability to drive down costs with scale.

The investors behind the now-defunct EV startup Canoo were always mysterious — in fact, they were only revealed as part of a lawsuit. Six years ago, I received a tip to look into one of them in particular: David Stern. He had connections to Prince Andrew but was otherwise a ghost.He was on my mind, though, as the Department of Justice started releasing its files on Jeffrey Epstein. My curiosity as to whether he would turn up in the documents was quickly overwhelmed by the fact that he was, in fact, a close business partner of the convicted sex offender. He brought Epstein investment opportunities from around the world, and in particular, pitched him on investing in Faraday Future, Lucid Motors, and Canoo during the go-go days of mobility funding. Read my story on Stern and Epstein’s relationship and how mobility startups were once in the mix.— Sean O’Kane

Autonomous vehicle technology is about more than just robotaxis — it is a difficult and costly business that only a handful of well-capitalized companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Zoox are pursuing. Many startup founders are applying the AV systems they’ve developed to other use cases, including off-road defense, trucking, forklifts, mining, and construction. Investors, anxious about missing out on the AV party, are jumping into these sectors.

Bedrock Robotics is the latest example of investor interest. The Silicon Valley autonomous vehicle technology startup, founded by veterans of Waymo and Segment, are developing a self-driving system that can be retrofitted onto construction equipment. And it just raised $270 million in Series B funding co-led by CapitalG and the Valor Atreides AI Fund. Other investors include Xora, 8VC, Eclipse, Emergence Capital, Perry Creek Capital, NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm), Tishman Speyer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgian, Incharge Capital, C4 Ventures, and others.

Bedrock raised more than $350 million in a short time (the company was formed in 2024). And while that might not seem like a lot compared to the size of some seed rounds in the AI labs sector, it shows money is flowing into physical AI startups. I expect more deal flow; importantly I expect the startups focused on practical applications of automated driving systems to attract talent — if they can afford them. Bedrock, for instance, hired Vincent Gonguet, who previously led AI safety and alignment at Meta for all Llama models, as its head of evaluation. It also hired John Chu away from Waymo.

Keep an eye out for my interview with Bedrock Robotics co-founder and CEO Boris Sofman.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

German electric motor maker Additive Drives raised €25 million ($29.5 million) from Nordic Alpha Partners.

Autonomous underwater vehicles startup Apeiron Labs closed a $9.5 million Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health, and S2G Investments. Assembly Ventures, Bay Bridge Ventures, and TFX Capital participated.

GoCab, the African mobility fintech startup, raised a $45 million financing round comprising $15 million in equity and $30 million in debt. The equity round was co-led by E3 Capital and Janngo Capital, with participation from KawiSafi Ventures and Cur8 Capital.

Mitra EV, a commercial EV fleet company in Los Angeles, raised $27 million in financing, including equity funding from lead investor Ultra Capital and a credit facility from S2G Investments.

Overland AI, a Seattle-based developer of self-driving systems designed for military operations, raised $100 million in a round led by 8VC. Other investors included Point72 Ventures, Ascend Venture Capital, Shasta Ventures, Overmatch Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and StepStone Group.

Plug, the used EV marketplace, raised $20 million in a Series A led by Lightspeed with participation from Galvanize and existing investors Autotech Ventures, Leap Forward Ventures, and Renn Global.

R3 Robotics, a European startup that wants to automate the disassembly of EV systems at scale, raised €20 million ($23.6 million) in combination of grants and venture funding. The €14 million ($16.5 million) Series A funding was co-led by HG Ventures and Suma Capital. Oetker Collection, the European Innovation Council Fund (EIC Fund), and existing shareholders, including BONVENTURE, FlixFounders, and EIT Urban Mobility also participated.

Skyryse, an El Segundo, California-based aviation automation startup, has raised more than $300 million in a Series C investment. The round, led by Autopilot Ventures, pushes its valuation to $1.15 billion. Other investors include Fidelity Management & Research Company, ArrowMark Partners, Atreides Management LP, BAM Elevate, Baron Capital Group, Durable Capital Partners, Positive Sum, Qatar Investment Authority, RCM Private Markets Fund managed by Rokos Capital Management, and Woodline Partners.

China has banned concealed electronically actuated door handles popularized by Tesla. The ruling, published by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, says all new cars sold in the country must have mechanical releases on their door handles by January 1, 2027. There is chatter that Europe could soon follow.

Uber continues to make moves designed to make it competitive in the autonomous vehicle sector. The company has promoted Balaji Krishnamurthy, its VP of strategic finance and investor relations, to be its CFO. This may not seem connected to AVs, but it is. Krishnamurthy actively promotes the company’s autonomous ride-hailing partnerships and has a board seat at AV company Waabi. During the company’s Q4 call, he talked about AVs, saying the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”

Meanwhile, a high-profile lawsuit against Uber has delivered a mixed verdict for the ride-hailing company, which was sued after a woman alleged she was raped by her Uber driver in November 2023. A jury determined Uber was liable as an apparent agent of the driver and awarded $8.5 million to the plaintiff. The jury rejected claims that Uber was liable for negligence or design defects and declined to award punitive damages. An Uber spokesperson, who emailed TechCrunch a statement, said the “verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety. We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do.” Uber plans to appeal the decision.

Last week in our newsletter, we did a poll asking what the name or ticker of Elon Musk’s combined supercompany should be. Thanks to those who emailed their suggestions, many of which had space themes, like Galactic X (great one). As for the poll, the majority picked plain ol’ X.

That makes sense, considering Musk has often talked, and posted, about X, the everything app. About 50% voted for X, while 20.7% picked ELON, 17.2% selected SpaceAI, and 12.1% chose K2, a reference to one of the corporate entities created in January.

My pick? I think it will ultimately be X, and the company will include more than just SpaceX and xAI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A march supporting California’s billionaires didn’t exactly attract a huge crowd on Saturday — the San Francisco Chronicle counted around three dozen attendees, along with another dozen tongue-in-cheek counter-protesters.

To be fair, organizer Derik Kauffman had predicted attendance of only “a few dozen” beforehand. But the incongruous idea of the “March for Billionaires” has provoked an outsized response on social media. And according to Mission Local, journalists nearly outnumbered demonstrators at the event itself, where marchers carried signs with messages like “We ❤️ You Jeffrey Bezos” and “It’s very difficult to write a nuanced argument on a sign.”

The ostensible reason for the demonstration was to protest the Billionaire Tax Act, a proposed state ballot measure that would require Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time, 5% tax on their total wealth. If the measure actually passes, Governor Gavin Newsom said he will veto it.

Kauffman, who founded the AI startup RunRL and is not a billionaire himself, told reporters, “California is, I believe, the only state to give health insurance to people who come into the country illegally. I think we probably should not be providing that.” (Fourteen states offer health care to undocumented immigrants.)

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/08/super-bowl-60-ai-ads-svedka-anthropic-brands-commercials/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following last year’s trend of showcasing AI in multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.

Let’s explore the biggest moments from this year’s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.

Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company’s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.

According to Svedka’s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.

​The company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.

​It’s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.

Either way, Svedka definitely got people talking.

Anthropic’s ad wasn’t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI’s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude’s features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example.

It wasn’t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI’s Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn’t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.

Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.

The ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.

The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year’s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.

Amazon’s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical “AI is out to get me” storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.

Beyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.

Ring’s commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet’s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.

Ring recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.

Google’s ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.

Ramp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner — the actor who played Kevin in “The Office” — for its Super Bowl commercial.

In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp’s AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp’s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.

And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin’s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.

Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.

Health company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson’s expensive anti-aging routines.

In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.

Website builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and “vibe coding” with full visual editing and customization.

Wix’s biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace’s ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

            <h2>‘The Trust Has Been Absolutely Destroyed’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/trump-gabbard-election-investigations-states/685922/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The email that federal law enforcement sent this week to the nation’s top election administrators would have been routine just a few years ago. “Your election partners,” the Tuesday missive from FBI Election Executive Kellie Hardiman read, “would like to invite you to a call where we can discuss preparations for the cycle.”

But multiple secretaries of state who received the document told us they viewed it as a threat, given recent events. The FBI had just seized 2020 election materials in Georgia, and President Trump had announced his desire to “nationalize” elections, a state responsibility under the U.S. Constitution. The Department of Justice has sued more than 20 states to obtain their election rolls, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is conducting an investigation of U.S. voting technology. The upshot is that a yearslong partnership between state and federal authorities—in which the feds have provided assistance on election security and protected state and local voting systems from threats—is now in danger of falling apart. Instead of “partners,” some state authorities now view federal officials involved in election efforts with deep suspicion.

“The trust,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told us, “has been absolutely destroyed.” The sentiment is not confined to Democrats. Some state-level Republican election officials, who, like others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity to speak freely, said that federal officials’ activities involving elections have become so unusual that they are starting to question the federal officials’ competency and motives. These state officials wonder whether the feds are trying to do what Trump has accused others of doing: rig an election.

With just more than eight months before midterm elections, Trump has already said that he will accept the results only “if the elections are honest,” and has mused that “we shouldn’t even have an election” given that the midterms typically result in defeats for the president’s party. He has called for the greater use of identification at all polling places, a ban on mail voting, and a prohibition on certain types of voting equipment. Inside the White House, his obsession with disproving the results of the 2020 election, which he lost, has led to the creation of a standing working group that meets regularly to coordinate federal efforts to investigate past elections and reform future election processes.

The result is a breakdown in the state and federal partnership that has long facilitated the nation’s elections. After a White House official, Jared Borg, told secretaries of state to expect a Cabinet-level briefing at a conference in Washington last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard failed to appear, according to Lawrence Norden, the vice president for elections and government at the Brennan Center for Justice, who attended the briefing. Days later, the election leaders received the email from Hardiman, a career official, who had appeared at the conference to discuss the more traditional roles the FBI plays in assisting election administrators, including investigations of threats to state and local election officials.

“It was very standard FBI stuff about their role in elections,” Norden told us. “In another time, this would not have raised any eyebrows.”

But Trump’s demands that his law-enforcement agencies chase election conspiracies could animate attempts to contest the 2026 election results should Democrats take control of the House, Senate, or both, election officials and experts said. The images of federal authorities seizing ballots in Georgia could reinforce the president’s false claims of widespread voter fraud and deepen suspicion about the legitimacy of elections. Experts say there is little indication that federal courts will allow Trump to dictate to states the methods or administration of elections. But officials are preparing for legal battles in the coming months, and say the courts will need to hold the line on federal interference.

“It’s kind of like Donald Trump saying to the prime minister of Greenland, ‘I’m your partner,’” the Democratic election attorney Marc Elias told us. “Saying this has been done in the past is cold comfort when Donald Trump is saying, in the Oval Office, that states are his vassals.”

Trump won reelection in 2024 without ever conceding his defeat in 2020. From the start of his second term, his senior team launched tandem efforts to rectify the imagined injustice of a rigged vote. The first focused on executive actions and legislative efforts to change the way elections are conducted in the future, a project that has so far yielded little progress. Federal judges have rejected Trump’s demands that states impose new identification rules and threats to withhold federal funding to states that don’t change their voting systems or voter-registration forms.

The second effort, which has begun to come to light in recent weeks, focused on using federal investigative power to find evidence that would confirm Trump’s belief about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. These investigations began as largely exploratory projects, seeking evidence to confirm what the president and some of his advisers have long believed about the possibility of past fraud. Many state governments have resisted efforts by the Department of Justice to obtain raw voting records, although some have cooperated.

One DOJ official characterized the seizure in Fulton County as a recalibration in strategy that resulted from the president’s frustration. “The White House has tried to get these ballots from day one,” this person said, referring to voting records in Georgia and other states that Trump lost in 2020.

Trump immediately offered support for the operation, and even got on the phone with FBI agents in Atlanta and with Gabbard to thank them for their efforts. “Now they’re going to find out the true winner of that state,” Trump said this week about the search, before making clear that there was only one right answer. “If there was cheating, which there was, but if there was cheating, it should be found, because we can’t let it happen again.”

Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said in a letter to Congress that Trump did not ask questions during the phone call and she and the president did not issue directives to FBI agents. She has launched a separate investigation of election-infrastructure vulnerabilities, which involved collecting voting equipment from Puerto Rico. Intelligence officials typically keep their distance from domestic law-enforcement matters. But in a February 2 letter to Congress, Gabbard said her work was being conducted under her statutory authority to “analyze intelligence related to election security, including counter-intelligence, foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity.” Gabbard attended the seizure in Fulton County, she said, at the request of Trump.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche both praised and appeared to try to minimize Gabbard’s role in recent public appearances. He told Fox News on Monday that “first of all, she wasn’t at the search; she was in the area where the search took place. She’s not part of this investigation.” He said on January 30 that Gabbard’s presence in Atlanta “shouldn’t be questioned.” But those close to the White House reluctantly acknowledge that she has managed to deliver—or create the perception that she has delivered—what the president wants. “Gabbard is the only one who has actually pulled it off,” one official said. While speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump congratulated Gabbard on her performance.

The involvement of the intelligence community reflects the president’s frustration with senior Justice Department officials and others he perceives as obstructing his agenda or being insufficiently loyal. “Justice has just sat on things for months,” an official told us. “It boggles the mind that they wouldn’t just take the ballots!” The official insisted that Trump “should have gotten them on the first day of his term.” This person said the president and his allies have concluded that “if there was a true Trump prosecutor, it would have already been done.”

One indication of the push for more deferential leadership at the DOJ is the elevation of the Missouri prosecutor Thomas Albus to oversee election investigations nationwide. Albus and his team have quietly conducted interviews, collected tens of thousands of pages of documents, and carried out other efforts in multiple states in recent months, according to  people familiar with the probes.

Albus has a pedigree as a longtime member of what has been referred to as the “Missouri conservative movement”—a group of current and former senior Republicans who have used the state’s power and resources to try to overturn the 2020 election. The group includes Ed Martin—the DOJ’s pardon attorney and the former head of its “Weaponization Working Group’’—as well as Senator Eric Schmitt, who led a group of Republican attorneys general in litigation efforts focused on the 2020 vote. Albus, who declined to comment for this story, is seen as more “reliable” than others at the DOJ by people close to the president, one person told us. The DOJ declined to comment.

Gabbard has led a separate effort involving personnel from numerous law-enforcement agencies, including the DOJ and the FBI, to arrange the “voluntary turnover” of electronic voting machines from Puerto Rico to her department. An ODNI spokesperson said that the agency “found extremely concerning cyber-security and operational deployment practices that pose a significant risk to U.S. elections” from the materials taken from Puerto Rico. A person briefed on the operation said the focus was on machines used in the 2020 election. A spokesperson for the ODNI said that the actions were not about any specific election. The efforts were “about assessing for vulnerabilities” in voting systems to help improve security for all elections, this person said.

So far, Gabbard and the ODNI have stopped short of alleging they have found evidence of foreign interference in prior elections. Some current and former officials believe that her efforts are intended to introduce enough doubt to lay the foundation for future fraud claims, or possibly provide a basis for the federal government to take over election administration in certain places. The location and chain of custody of the seized voting materials from Fulton are tightly guarded secrets. Officials at the DOJ and the ODNI will not say where federal authorities took the materials, or if they even remain in Georgia. Fulton officials have gone to court to try to reclaim the materials, arguing that the federal government is violating rules intended to ensure the integrity of ballots and a clear chain of custody. “Fulton County can no longer be held responsible for what happens to any items contained in those boxes that relate to the 2020 election,” Robb Pitts, the chair of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, told us. “I don&#39;t know who has those 700 boxes now, nor do I know what they’re doing with them.”

Some election administrators fear that the efforts will erode public confidence in elections and could create a legal predicate for more aggressive moves by Trump later this year. Cleta Mitchell, a Republican activist who has advised Trump in the past, has argued that a federal election takeover would be possible after the president declares a national emergency based on a threat to the “sovereignty” of the country. Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump, has been rallying the president’s supporters to demand military deployments to polling places this fall.  “You have got to call up the 82nd and the 101st Airborne on the Insurrection Act. You’ve got to get around every poll,” Bannon said this week on his online show, War Room. “We will not accept anything less.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt distanced the president from Bannon’s comments this week, saying the administration had no plans to send immigration enforcement to polling places. Inside the West Wing, top advisers to the president have also resisted any plans for a “nationalization” of voting processes, despite Trump’s suggestion that the federal government could “take over the voting” in “15 places.” His focus, his advisers say, is on legislative changes to voting procedures, reforms that are permitted by the Constitution but face Democratic resistance in the Senate.

“President Trump pledged to secure America’s elections, and he has tasked the most talented team of patriots to do just that,” the White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told us in a statement. “The President’s team, including DNI Gabbard and FBI Director Patel, are working together to implement the President’s election integrity priorities, and their work continues to serve him and the entire country well.”

On Thursday, Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told reporters that “it appears there may be a coordinated effort to try to interfere in the ’26 midterms. They may even start to interfere in, prior to, in the primaries, or in a state like mine, where they may have—we may have—a statewide referendum on redistricting.” The ODNI declined to respond.

At a minimum, elections officials face the renewed burden of defending the credibility of voting systems that have repeatedly proved themselves in recent years. Some Republican campaign consultants have warned that the effort could backfire on their own midterm efforts by decreasing turnout among the president’s base and increasing turnout among Democrats.

“There is certainly going to be an influence campaign to undermine confidence in the election,” Norden, of the Brennan Center, told us. “Those are the things that we need to be preparing for.”

Elections officials told us they are now getting ready for interference from both foreign adversaries and the White House. Several said they are still deliberating whether to show up to the FBI-hosted meeting scheduled for February 25. Others said they will attend but not speak out of concern that their information could be turned against them. The FBI declined to make its election executive available for an interview and noted to us that the invitation to meet with Hardiman and other federal officials is not out of the ordinary.

State officials are readying for intense scrutiny by federal authorities. Authorities in one state told us they have retained outside legal counsel in case federal officials seek 2020-related materials, and are drafting legislation to try to make it harder for the U.S. government to do so. Georgia election officials told us they have been working overtime to consult with criminal attorneys. Some Republican election chiefs said they were trying to avoid engaging with federal officials at all, and some said their trust with federal officials was situational.

In Maricopa County, Arizona, anxieties are so high that county officials are contacting employees who worked on the 2024 presidential election—which Trump won—to determine whether they have records on their private electronic devices that should be preserved to comply with a DOJ litigation hold they received last year, three people told us. The county’s request to employees came amid fears that county officials—who weathered years of violent threats and harassment after Trump’s 2020 loss—could be accused by federal prosecutors of obstruction of justice.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Updated at 3:40 p.m. ET on February 8, 2026

Lindsey Vonn always knew that it would take just one slight catch of an edge to turn her from the reigning empress of alpine skiing into a broken figure in the snow. That’s the nature of the Olympic downhill. It was no use for the scolds and skeptics to warn an athlete like Vonn, who, at 41, had one rebuilt knee and a torn ACL on the other, that she might hurt herself. Exactly what did they think downhilling was if not a dangerous flirtation with crack-up, a headlong battle against not only the race clock but also the one that, over years, erodes your bones and joints? This was Vonn saying No thank you. I’d rather do a number on myself than let that bastard Time do it to me.

She crashed fewer than 14 seconds into her final downhill Olympics run at Cortina d’Ampezzo, and the cosmic joke was that her left knee, on which she was racing despite a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, wasn’t to blame. Seeking to attack on a sidehill line, Vonn caught the fourth gate with her ski pole. As she sailed into an angled turn, the caught pole yanked her back by the arm, and her skis canted dead sideways, giving her no chance to recover. The mountain rose up. Her skis sprayed geysers of snow, and she cartwheeled.

Down at the finish line, her American teammate Breezy Johnson, the eventual gold medalist, immediately put a hand over her eyes. The snow-muffled silence of shock made Vonn’s cries of pain (“Oh my God!”) audible. Her blue racing skins stood out vividly as she lay unmoving on the slope. The emergency sled was red. The rescue helicopter was yellow, dangling her in the air over the jagged white Dolomites. They were primary colors, like children’s paint, but they signaled that Vonn’s epic, extended youth might finally be over.

By midafternoon, after hours of uncertainty, Ca’ Foncello Hospital in Treviso released a statement confirming that Vonn “underwent orthopedic surgery to stabilize a fracture sustained in her left leg,” effectively ending her hopes of skiing in other scheduled events at Cortina. But there was no question at all of regret. She had said so much in the days leading up to the race. “I’ve always pushed the limits and in downhill, it’s a very dangerous sport and anything can happen. Because I push the limits, I crash,” she said earlier in the week. She added, “and I’ve been injured more times than I would like to admit, to myself even.”

From the beginning of her career, when she burst onto the Olympic scene at the age of 17, Vonn has been unafraid to risk her entire frame chasing speed—all grit, white-blond hair, and high emotion. Initially inconsistent, she closely studied her responses to pressure, and when she realized her father was exerting too much of it, she found the strength to distance herself from him for a time. She dealt with fear almost clinically: In an interview with me for The Washington Post at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, she told me she thought “it would be interesting to take a blood test right in the starting gate” to know more about the adrenals pumping inside a skier standing before a steeply pitched sheet that demanded speeds of 80 miles an hour in nothing but a nylon skin. After winning a race in 2005, she’d been offered the choice of a winner’s check of 5,000 euros or a cow. She took the cow. She named her Olympe and kept her on a farm in France, where she visited her for a sense of calm. “She’s very serene,” she told me in Turin.. A couple of days later, Vonn crashed badly in training and suffered severe back and hip contusions. She competed anyway and finished eighth in the downhill race.

In 2019, worsening knee injuries forced Vonn to retire; she could not even hike without pain. Five years later, she had her right knee partially replaced with titanium components; the surgery was so successful that she resumed professional skiing in late 2024. The former Olympic champion Michaela Dorfmeister was among the loudest in a chorus of disapproving voices, saying that skiing on a replaced knee was too risky; Vonn “should see a psychologist,” Dorfmeister said, and asked, “Does she want to kill herself?”

Vonn answered with an extraordinary performance early this season, making the medal podium in seven of her recent eight races, winning twice, to become the Olympic favorite. Having won a gold in 2014 and a bronze in 2018, she was now competing to be the oldest person ever to win an Olympic medal in downhill skiing.

And then less than two weeks ago came the total rupture of her ACL in a race in Crans-Montana. Cortina now represented a new frontier, even for Vonn. Her fearless mind had to contend with the reality of her breakable body. But in her last training run Saturday on her torn-up right knee, facing the course that defeated her today, she clocked the third-fastest time.

How was it even possible for Vonn to ski—at all—days after such an injury? That was a matter of the quirkiness of the knee, according to orthopedists. The ACL is an internal ligament between the femur and the tibia that acts as a stabilizer for pivoting motions. But it’s just one of four major stabilizers, and you can run without it, as long as you aren’t stopping short. In more straight-line activities, it’s not of the “utmost importance” if the rest of the knee is healthy, Vehniah K. Tjong, an associate professor of medicine at Northwestern and a team doctor for the U.S.A. national women’s soccer team, told me yesterday. At the Super Bowl this week, the New England Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs, who tore his ACL last year, remarked about Vonn, “People can run. People can do whatever they need to do once they get the swelling out. So, it’s kind of a weird injury.”

Perhaps just as significant: Athletes are built differently from you or me, mechanically and mentally. Vonn was in such superb shape that she was able to do box jumps and weighted squats with the ruptured ligament as she prepared to race in Cortina, suggesting that her other ligaments were strong enough to compensate. A leg brace also gave her added stability. “The amount of muscular development and body control that she has is exceptional and different from most other people,” Christopher C. Annunziata, the team orthopedist for the NFL’s Washington Commanders, told me before the crash. As for pain tolerance, Annunziata believes elite athletes are on not just another level but a different planet. He often leaves the Commanders locker room joking that it’s “time to return to the real world.”

Even among this subset of humanity, Vonn was unusually experienced at competing—and medaling—with preexisting injuries. In the 2019 World Championships, her last race before her initial retirement, she took a bronze despite a tear in another ligament, her LCL, and three tibial-plateau fractures in her right knee. “This is not unknown for me; I’ve done this before,” she said at a press conference this week in Milan.

Some critics nevertheless suggested that Vonn was taking up a spot that a younger, healthier U.S. skier could have occupied. When the mental-performance coach Greg Graber opined in USA Today that maybe she couldn’t let go of competing because she is prone to “overidentify” with being an athlete, she shot back on X, “This ageism stuff is getting really old.”

Vonn was adamant that she would be in the starting gate, and her body of work—45 World Cup downhill victories, the record for women—suggested that she had earned the right to at least try. “As many times as I’ve crashed, I’ve always gotten back up, and as many times as I’ve failed, I’ve always won,” she pointed out.

But today was all crashing, and no getting up.</div>

Somehow the word allow is in the word swallow and in swallow two wholly different meanings: one to take in through the mouth and another what we call the common winged gnat hunter who is, in all probability, somewhere near us now. Once, I thought if I knew all the words I would say the right thing in the right way, instead language becomes more brutish: blink twice for the bird, blink once for tender annihilation.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans watching the Super Bowl today will hear a tantalizing pitch: You, too, can live like the rich. All you need is a way to order up health care the way they do.

A new ad scheduled to air during the big game, from the telehealth company Hims & Hers, opens with the provocation “Rich people live longer.” A dizzying montage spoofing America’s wealthiest and most wellness-obsessed characters follows: An ageless man bathes in red light in the manner of Bryan Johnson, the multimillionaire who rose to fame for his fanatical efforts to live forever. A bald man doffs a cowboy hat as a rocket blasts off—clearly an allusion to Jeff Bezos, who in recent years has become incredibly buff and backed a buzzy age-reversal start-up. Surgeons pull the sagging face of a woman taut as a drum, perhaps a reference to the Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner’s notorious 2025 facelift. Dan Kenger, the chief design officer at Hims & Hers, told me in an email that the actors in the commercial represent only “symbols of an intimidating, members-only healthcare culture.” But the parallels to real life are too obvious to ignore. “They get the best of everything,” the voiceover continues. “So why don’t you?”

Hims & Hers is best known for offering weight-loss and hair-restoration treatments, but the ad positions the company as a gateway to a different world of health care—one with concierge doctors who are available on demand to offer personalized, cutting-edge therapies. “America’s healthcare is a tale of two systems: one elite, proactive tier for the wealthy, and a broken, reactive one for everyone else,” Kenger said. Hims & Hers’ actual offerings, which include diagnostic blood testing and hormone therapy, may be more mundane than a facelift, but the ad emphasizes one thing they all share: They’re all available to you, for a price.

Telehealth platforms such as Hims & Hers offer patients the ability to pay out of pocket to quickly seek treatment for their ailments. Generally, they assert that patients must consult virtually with a medical provider before receiving a prescription, but this requirement isn’t featured prominently in most ads. The new spot from Hims & Hers notes that its doctors are around to chat, and—in the fine print—mentions that a consultation with a provider is required before receiving treatment. But unless you’re squinting at the screen, the message that comes across is that health care is primarily a transaction between patient and company.

In general, telehealth platforms have come to essentially function as a kind of Amazon for drugs, making it easier for people to get prescriptions for controlled substances such as Adderall and testosterone. The companies sidestep the high cost associated with many name-brand drugs by using compounding pharmacies to offer cheaper, nearly identical versions of the medications. In theory, a licensed provider writes the prescription after a thorough medical assessment. But in just the past two years, two different telehealth practices have been sanctioned for inappropriately prescribing stimulants. (Hims & Hers has not faced any federal investigations for its prescribing practices.)

Last year, Hims & Hers ran a Super Bowl ad similarly focused on democratizing care—specifically GLP-1s for weight loss. It asserted that America’s obesity epidemic is caused by “the system,” which keeps people sick by making health care unaffordable. When name-brand GLP-1s such as Wegovy first started being prescribed for weight loss, in 2021, they were inaccessible for most Americans because of their steep cost and insurance providers’ limited coverage. Rumors that celebrities were using the drugs for cosmetic reasons sparked a mix of outrage and envy, and as Americans of more humble means began to see the results the drugs could bring about, many began scrambling for cheaper sources—a perfect opportunity for Hims & Hers and its peers.

But Americans aren’t clamoring for just GLP-1s anymore. Medications such as testosterone and peptides—a largely untested class of drugs with a wide range of purported health benefits—are in high demand too. Like GLP-1s, they have been touted by wealthy, high-profile figures, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Joe Rogan, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Hims & Hers has positioned itself to meet these demands. Last year, the company launched its low-testosterone treatment program and bought a peptide-manufacturing facility. It plans to use that factory to make its own “personalized” drugs.

Such language evokes the concierge treatments enjoyed by the rich. But in telehealth-platform parlance, personalization usually refers to creating a version of a name-brand medication that fits a patient’s needs by, say, changing the dose, adding other active ingredients, or offering it in a different format. These compounded versions aren’t reviewed by the FDA—in fact, the FDA announced Friday that it had asked the Justice Department, out of concern for consumer safety, to investigate Hims & Hers for selling compounded GLP-1 pills. The move is part of the DOJ’s wider plan to take “decisive steps” to restrict the marketing of compounded GLP-1s.

The medical community is concerned that telehealth platforms too easily allow patients to take unsafe drugs—or drugs they simply don’t need. The Obesity Society, a scientific organization, warns people not to use compounded GLP-1s, because they may not contain the appropriate active ingredients. (As I wrote recently, men’s-health experts are also worried about the cardiovascular and reproductive consequences of unnecessary testosterone-replacement therapy.) When I asked Hims & Hers about the DOJ investigation, a spokesperson directed me to a public statement posted yesterday on X, in which the company said it would stop selling compounded GLP-1 pills. “We remain committed to the millions of Americans who depend on us for access to safe, affordable, and personalized care,” the statement said.

The Hims & Hers ad is shrewd in its heavy-handedness. It validates Americans’ frustration with health care and positions itself as a deliverer of justice. (The ad is narrated by the rapper Common, known for his socially conscious music; in its Super Bowl ad last year, the company used Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” a song about systemic racism and gun violence, to pile onto its message of a broken system.) Pew Research Center data released a few days ago show that 71 percent of Americans are worried about the cost of health care.

At the same time, Americans can’t seem to stop imitating billionaires’ wellness habits: untested peptides, NAD+ IV drips, Erewhon smoothies, red-light masks, keto diets. A slew of other planned Super Bowl ads promoting new visions of health illustrates just how central the pursuit of wellness has become to American life and the American economy, even when the benefits of so many of these practices are questionable at best. Hims & Hers is accurate in its diagnosis that much of this country’s gap in health and longevity boil down to wealth. But the treatment it prescribes seems to be an unlikely cure.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The Civil War isn’t what it used to be. Instead of the romantic version, a “good war” of courage and glory, that emerged in the conflict’s immediate aftermath, or the post-civil-rights-era emphasis on the war as the vector of liberation for 4 million enslaved African Americans, a more recent direction has been labeled the “dark turn.” Grim rather than celebratory, it has chronicled the war’s cost and cruelty, exploring subjects such as death, ruins, starvation, disease, atrocities, torture, amputations, and postwar trauma, as well as a freedom that was rapidly undermined.

W. Fitzhugh Brundage’s gripping new book, aptly titled A Fate Worse Than Hell: American Prisoners of the Civil War, represents an essential contribution to this rethinking in its account of what was perhaps the most horrifying realization of the suffering and inhumanity the war produced. But Brundage, who teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, does more than expand our understanding of a neglected aspect of Civil War history. His study offers a window into larger questions—about the evolution of laws of war and the definition of war crimes, about the ethical responsibility of combatants, about the growth of the nation-state and its attendant bureaucracy, and about the defining presence of race in the morality play of American history. As one Vermont infantryman wrote from a Confederate prison camp, “Here is where I can see human nature in its true light.”

At the beginning of the fighting, in 1861, no one anticipated that more than 400,000 men would become prisoners of war and that at least half of these would spend extended time in sites of what we would now call mass incarceration. The odds of being captured by the enemy in World War II were 1 in 100. In the Civil War, they were 1 in 5. As Brundage observes, three times as many Union soldiers died at the Confederate camp in Andersonville, Georgia, as at Gettysburg. Overall, approximately 10 percent of the war’s deaths occurred in prisons.

From the December 2023 issue: Drew Gilpin Faust on the men who started the Civil War

But prison camps attained this scale and significance only gradually. Both sides were initially uncertain about how to handle enemy captives. “What should be done with the prisoners?” the Richmond Whig asked. Treatment was largely ad hoc and depended to a considerable degree on individual commanders, but customarily prisoners would be exchanged or placed on parole—granted their freedom but required by oath not to return to military action. Rooted in assumptions about gentlemen’s honor and the integrity of pledges, the notion of parole now seems quaint, and it disappeared as the brutality of the war escalated. Some members of Abraham Lincoln’s Cabinet even argued for executing Confederate prisoners as traitors, but Congress and the public exerted pressure on the president to establish procedures to facilitate the return of captured Yankees. Formal provisions for the exchange of prisoners was not agreed upon until the summer of 1862, delayed by the Union’s reluctance to take any action that implied recognition of Confederate nationhood. Under the terms of the Dix-Hill agreement, some 30,000 prisoners were returned from captivity by the fall, but the formal exchange arrangement was soon upended.

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued in preliminary form in September 1862, provided for the recruitment of Black troops into the Union Army. Viewing this new policy as equivalent to fomenting slave rebellion, the South rejected any exchange of Black soldiers and did not extend them the protections of prisoners of war. They might be killed on the battlefield even after they surrendered, or remanded into slavery, or consigned to camps where they endured disproportionately harsh treatment.

Lincoln was resolute in his resistance to these measures. If Black soldiers could not be exchanged, no soldiers would be exchanged. The Dix-Hill agreement was suspended, and the number of prisoners of war grew exponentially; the result was camps the size of cities and untold misery for thousands of men in both the North and the South. Only during the last months of the war, with slavery disintegrating and northern victory all but assured, did exchanges resume.

Brundage characterizes the creation of the camps as an “innovation,” describing them as “experiments in custodial imprisonment” that exceeded anyone’s prewar imagination. These were modern inventions made possible by the introduction of railroads to transport prisoners long distances from battlefields, and by the growth of administrative and organizational structures required to manage not just mass armies but hundreds of thousands of prisoners. Although they emerged out of war-born imperatives, the camps were, he insists, a choice made by northern and southern policy makers alike, motivated by assumptions and purposes for which Brundage argues they must bear responsibility.

Both sides believed that any sympathetic act toward the enemy would represent an insult to their own soldiers. The Union commissary general in charge of prison administration proclaimed that “it is not expected that anything more will be done to provide for the welfare of the rebel prisoners than is absolutely necessary,” and that work on a prison camp under renovation should “fall far short of perfection.” During spring and summer months, he mandated that any clothing distributions include neither underwear nor socks.

From the July 1862 issue: Nathaniel Hawthorne interviewed civil and military leaders during the Civil War

But whatever the moral and logistical shortcomings evident on both sides, Brundage draws a clear distinction between North and South. “By any reasonable measure,” he judges, “Confederate prisoners were better kept than their Union counterparts.” Southern officials, he concludes, “never fully accepted the obligation to provide for prisoners of war.” Union prisoners were regarded not as human beings but as “a security liability that imposed no ethical imperative.” The South housed its captives in ill-adapted existing spaces. Richmond’s Libby Prison was a converted tobacco factory; the Salisbury, North Carolina, prison had been a textile mill; camps in Montgomery and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Macon, Georgia, were former slave jails. At the notorious Andersonville camp, no structures were provided at all. Men were not even issued tents but scrounged to procure shirts, blankets, or other bits of cloth to drape over sticks of wood to create what they called “shebangs.” Those unable to find cloth or wood dug holes in the ground.

The Union, in contrast, erected barracks and designed purpose-built enclosures for this new experiment in large-scale imprisonment. Those overseeing Union prison camps acknowledged that providing food and shelter for captives was indeed a moral obligation, even if on numerous occasions they failed to deliver adequately on that commitment. Yet the 25 percent death rate at the North’s worst prison, in Elmira, New York, came close to that at Andersonville (29 percent); overall, the mortality rate was 16 percent for Union prisoners and 12 percent for Confederates. Cruelty and corruption recognized no regional boundaries, and officials on both sides seem to have come closer to despising than sympathizing with their suffering captives.

There is a long tradition—born in the midst of the war itself—of accusation and debate about which side behaved worse. Defending the South’s treatment of its prisoners became a central theme for the neo-Confederates of the Lost Cause as the movement to rehabilitate the South emerged in the late 19th century. The blame for the surge in incarceration in 1863 and beyond should rest with the Union, they contended, for it was the North that halted the prisoner exchange. Pressing the advantage of their superior numbers, the North mercilessly kept captured Confederates in prison camps to prevent them from returning to the field to replenish the South’s diminishing ranks. The North’s decisions about prisoner exchanges were based on military calculations, not benevolent concern for Black captives. The South, they argued, did its best with its prisoners, given the scarcities of resources available to Confederate soldiers and citizens alike, scarcities they blamed on the Union effort to destroy the southern economy by blockading ports.

Professional historians in the early 20th century were not as explicitly partisan as the United Daughters of the Confederacy and their supporters. Yet, influenced by William B. Hesseltine’s field-defining Civil War Prisons, published in 1930, they adopted a kind of everybody-inevitably-made-mistakes approach that exonerated Confederates of any intentional moral failings. At the same time, they attributed to the North a vindictiveness arising from “abolitionist propaganda” that exaggerated Confederate prison atrocities.

The first comprehensive—one might say encyclopedic—study of prison camps since Hesseltine, Brundage’s book challenges these arguments head-on and assigns responsibility to the South’s unwavering commitment to slavery and Black subordination. Post-civil-rights-era attitudes about the equality of African Americans have prompted a different assessment of who caused the breakdown in prisoner exchanges, and thus bore the onus for the suffering and death that ensued: It was the South’s refusal to recognize Black soldiers as free men and thus treat them as prisoners of war, not Lincoln’s principled reaction to this Confederate policy, that produced such large numbers of Civil War captives. And Brundage ensures that his readers will not dismiss the record of prison atrocities. Although he offers examples of miseries from both northern and southern camps, his portrait of Andersonville leaves the most vivid impression of what the war’s moral compromises came to mean.

Andersonville was not created until February 1864, but in the months that followed, as many as 90 trainloads, containing 75 men to a boxcar, soon established its unprecedented scale. The camp consisted of a stockade erected around a 16-acre field by 200 enslaved workers commandeered from nearby plantations. Andersonville was designed to hold 10,000 prisoners, but its population reached as high as 33,000. The camp had no sanitation system, no barracks, no clothing allocations, and scant rations distributed uncooked to men without pans or utensils or firewood. Disease—scurvy, typhoid, dysentery—was rampant among prisoners, but medical treatment was worse than inadequate. In the prison hospital, made up of dilapidated tents, 70 percent of the patients died. When Confederate officials arrived to inspect the camp in May 1864 and again that August, they were shocked by what they saw. Nearly 13,000 men lie buried in the Andersonville National Cemetery, which the nurse and future founder of the American Red Cross Clara Barton helped establish on the site at the end of the war.

A great strength of Brundage’s study is the breadth and depth of his research; he makes deft use of a wide variety of evidence beyond the official records on which much earlier historical work on Civil War prisons has rested. He opens the book with a consideration of a series of photographs of Andersonville that in themselves make minimizing the horror and suffering impossible. A photographer from Macon, 60 miles away, seemingly compelled by pure curiosity, spent an August day in 1864 taking panoramic pictures of life within the camp stockade—the ground obscured under a sea of shabby improvised shelters; the swarm of prisoners gathered to receive rations; the men seated bare-bottomed over an open trench that would carry their waste into the same stream that provided their drinking water. Illustrations throughout the book support Brundage’s insights and arguments.

Yet perhaps even more striking than the pictures are the words taken from prisoners’ letters, diaries, and memoirs. Brundage accompanies his narrative of evolving prison policies with voices and stories of individual men. “Are we to be exchanged, or are we to be left here to perish?” asked Orin H. Brown, William H. Johnson, and William Wilson, three Black Union sailors, in the summer of 1863, still packed into a crowded Charleston prison half a year after their ship had surrendered and their captured comrades, all of them white, had been exchanged. Somehow their petition—miraculously evading Confederate interception and traveling, via the Bahamas, to Washington—arrived on the Navy secretary’s desk, though they likely weren’t released until the end of the war. For Frederic Augustus James, a prisoner at Salisbury, unreliable mail was one of many sources of agony; he learned of his 8-year-old daughter’s death five months after the fact, a succession of his wife’s letters having never reached him. Four months after his transfer to Andersonville, he died of dysentery.

William Hesseltine and his followers had dismissed such sources as at best partial and at worst partisan in their exposition of the cruelties inflicted by their wartime enemies. Brundage approaches these materials with an appropriately critical eye, demonstrating their consistency with other records and their value in providing deeper human insight into prisoners’ experiences. What Hesseltine claimed as objective history, Brundage both tells and shows us, was in actuality far from objective; it placed the story in the hands of the official record keepers while silencing those who were the victims of their decisions and policies. Incorporating their accounts, Brundage provides his readers with a far richer and more complete version of the past.

At the same time, he casts his book as being about the present and the future as well. Mass internment, as he portrays it, is a product of modernity, made possible by technology and growing organizational and logistical capacities. But it was also a deliberate choice, a callous and conscious decision. “What combination of institutional authority and procedures,” he asks, “eroded the moral inhibitions of officials, commanders, and camp staff, thereby making it easier for them to abandon the responsibility they might otherwise have felt to ease the suffering of the fellow humans” at Andersonville? It is hard to look at the most terrible pictures of captives ultimately returned to the North without seeing in one’s mind the photographs of those liberated from Nazi concentration camps eight decades later.

Yet the demands of modernity produced some humane outcomes that also presaged the future. The dilemma of how to deal with Civil War prisoners served as a catalyst for General Orders No. 100, issued by the War Department in 1863. It was the first systematic codification of the rules of war and became the foundation for modern international humanitarian law. It led to the trial and subsequent execution at the war’s end of Henry Wirz, the commander at Andersonville, for conspiring “to impair the lives of Union prisoners.” Northern prosecutors had hoped to charge top Confederate leadership, including President Jefferson Davis, in a series of postwar trials. In the end, Wirz was their only major conviction, because southern outrage and northern demands to forgive and forget brought an end to the legal effort. But Wirz’s trial represented the origin of modern prosecution of war crimes.

“Military necessity,” General Orders No. 100 directs, “does not admit of cruelty.” In the Civil War’s prison camps, it did just that. Yet the statement encodes an aspiration and an expectation, if not always an enforceable law. Born of Civil War suffering, international humanitarian law demands, as does Brundage’s important book, that we recognize cruelty as a choice.

Compared to the US government, I&#39;m far less concerned about what China does with my data. The Chinese government can&#39;t send masked secret police to my home to abduct me.

Sooner or later we&#39;ll have geopolitically aligned software. The Israeli pager attack showed how dangerous it is to not have a friendly superpower produce your electronics. The same problem exists in software, perhaps to an even greater degree.

In that world I expect open source to win, because that&#39;s the only way to create trustworthy software while avoiding doing a huge amount of duplicate work.

The US has been afraid of those &quot;nefarious Asians&quot; for over a hundred years now.

More of this, please.  The ongoing dilution of &quot;racist&quot; to the point of parody is improving our world.

&quot;Someone once observed to me that my attitudes towards people I&#39;ve never met were unfounded, and I&#39;ve since spent my entire life orbiting the memory of this unjustified event&quot;

It&#39;s sort of funny how often people with extremely niche perspectives consider them to be universal but suppressed. I&#39;d tell you to stop telling on yourself but that ship sailed years ago.

It would racist if the rules said &quot;Chinese engineers,&quot; but it says &quot;Chinese companies.&quot;

Nothing stops those companies from relocating to say Singapore.

Maybe this is less about security and more about who gets paid?

no the software will be written by an america company who out sources it to the same people who they took it form.

Clearly. As this is totally unworkable, anybody needs to throw money at the orange rapist to get an exception.

I don&#39;t see any restriction from say Japanese, Korean or European vendors. Who, specifically, do you believe is getting paid?

Honestly I see exactly the concern with this: Always available cameras with an always eye level 360 degree view high resolution camera that likely also provides distance measurement. Have them ubiquitous everywhere, and if you&#39;re a spy agency, you&#39;ve got a fantastic surveillance tool. Especially great for blackmail.

Right?  Make sure that there&#39;s no American code.  Make sure everything is open source if used.  After all it seems that all the cars that have stopped working so far have been American cars, that have been remotely disabled, etc.

The trumpistani cars that sell in Europe are either cheap, EU made utilitarian models or individual imports of &quot;muscle car&quot; monstrocities for the occasional connoisseur of stupid waste.

Why would you buy junk that breaks often, guzzles gas and destroys the environment when you can actually have a much nicer European, Japanese or Korean car?

New U.S. rules will soon ban Chinese software in vehicle systems that connect to the cloud&quot;Cool, disconnect my car completely then.&quot;   

. . . but of  course, this decision will be made by the real owners of the car, not the guy who merely &quot;bought&quot; it.

Amazon will pay out nothing you need to sue the DSP

Just become a billionaire and you’ll be fine.

so the low wage worker does the hard time and has no funds to pay out and no one up chain takes an hit. with the victim being out of pocket.

Amazon is already working on the repairs to the building, that seems like the correct first step since no one was actually hurt in the incident... as for fines, OK, I&#39;d love to hear the law/regulation that says when an autonomous drone hits a building, you have to pay a fine (or do jail time) - and no, if your personal drone hit a building and didn&#39;t hurt anyone you wouldn&#39;t go to jail, accidental damage to a building isn&#39;t a criminal offense

That is pretty sick that you are looking forward to someone getting killed.

But if it does excite you so much, I suggest tracking Amazon / UPS / FedEx delivery truck fatalities instead. You&#39;ll get to enjoy hearing about a few fatalities every month.

There has never been any point in history, including pre-recorded history, during which humans acted in a fair and reasonable fashion as a group.

Those in power (whether their power be derived from wealth or political influence) are held to a different standard from everyone else.  It has always been this way.  It was this way when we were hunter-gatherers living in forests and caves.  It was this way before we even qualified as humans.

This is not a quirk of culture or circumstance.  This is a property of hu

Now if I had a drone flying around, for whatever the purpose, and crashed it into someone&#39;s apartment building, I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;d be arrested and facing all matter of criminal charges. In fact, I could expect a raid by feds and I&#39;d be looking down the barrel of an MP5. No, you wouldn&#39;t, accidental property damage without injury to a person is not a criminal offense. Intentional property damage is a crime, but this was not intentional.Bodily injury is a crime, but no one was hurt.If you lose control of your car (accidentally) and hit someone&#39;s home and do not cause bodily harm to anyone, you are responsible for the repairs, you aren&#39;t charged with a criminal offense, you don&#39;t go to jail, and your home will not be raided by federal agents.

a photographer flew a drone into a building at my cousins wedding, just on a  smaller scale.

Would you rather be hit by 50 drone sized trucks, or one truck sized drone?

I can - you&#39;d be responsible for fixing the damage, and your drone operation would be examined to establish if you were following all relevant rules and regulations.

It really isn&#39;t hard to imagine what would happen - it&#39;s just about the same process as if you hit an apartment building with your car...

If you didn&#39;t build that apartment building, there wouldn&#39;t have been the crash. Duh.

On what charge? Seriously, this makes no sense.

Elderly people drive into buildings all the time. Nothing happens besides their insurance premium going up.

I wonder how many cars ran into buildings that same day?  or that week, or that month?

The only reason we hear about this is it&#39;s novel.

It&#39;s like comparing airplane crashes with car crashes.  Frequency of occurrence: 1:10,000.  Frequency of media coverage: 10,000:1

It&#39;s impossible to tell how unusual something is baed on whether or not it made the 6:00 news.

The question isn&#39;t about value for money.  It&#39;s about does a  focused splurge by one market like this foretell a quickly approaching crash of that same market?

Outside of Super Bowl ad spending, the amount of money being invested can&#39;t possibly pay off.  No one thinks AI is that great. Even if the mythical AGI already existed it still wouldn&#39;t be worth the size of the spend.  There has to be a correction, and a big one.

You have not been hanging around computational biologists lately. I can tell.

LOL, has anyone?  That sounds like a very rare breed.

&quot;Do Super Bowl Ads For AI Signal a Bubble About to Burst?&quot;

Betteridge&#39;s Law aside, is this question calling the 1984 Apple Mac ad a signal that a bubble is about to burst?  Some Super Bowls ads are bubble busts, some are great successes, and most are in between.

And people DO like AI, when it is directly serving their needs.  AI-powered apps are popular in all markets where they appear.  People like asking them questions and getting answers more quickly than if they went spelunking through search results on the Internet.  People like chatting with chatbots, and especially people like generating silly art using prompts.  This stuff is all over the place!

If only this would hold true for all of the sports betting commercials like fan duel.

Maybe just surrender to the Chinese and start using emojis for everything.

If you look at the articles over the last few years you will see that no they haven&#39;t.  The types of articles showing up here seem to have followed a pattern similar to other new technologies (curved screens, 3D TV, VR) where it starts off with articles discussing the technology from a technical perspective,  moves on to discussions speculating on potential growth and impacts on the wider community, starts moving onto financials of the companies involved and then moves on to decline in interest.

... that the AI bubble slowly deflates and makes a soft landing, instead of bursting or popping.

If the AI bubble bursts of pops, the subsequent economic fallout and recession will upend the economy, and the livelyhood of plenty of people not related (even tangentially) to the AI bubble itself will be severely affected.

It will NOT be pretty if the AI bubble Pops or Bursts...

That would be nice. But remember that the LLM-stupidity is currently all props up the US economy? And that the business numbers of all of them are utterly catastrophic? And that the evidence mounts that there are actually very few valid and no high-value applications for LLMs?

I would be all for a soft landing, but I think what is incoming is a 20 year or so world economic crisis that  will be really, really bad. Hopefully the current assholes of the AI community will also never recover and we also get a 20

If we had a recession it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world. It would probably be pretty healthy in the long run.

Pretty much how I feel about the AI bubble. Yeah it will suck for some but I really doubt it will kill the American economy.

Now the housing bubble is a whole different ballgame and that popping combined with a devaluation of the USD will have genuinely catastrophic impacts on the American and even the global economy.

Chances are, everything will pop together.

This Super Bowl has had some of the lamest and lowest effort ads I have seen in two or so decades of the Super Bowl. The AI ads are just the hallucinated cherry on top.

That AI.com one in particular shilling Sam, Elon, and AGI in particular was just pure unadulterated cringe. Could they really not think of an actual ad, even if it was generated by AI?

Though the Ring one had some genuine dystopian vibes with their newest feature for finding lost dogs. Totally not selling surveillance as a service here.

.....we had all .com era Superbowl ads.  Bigger, better, funnier.  And generally gone by 2002.

Yes, Al Gore did not say he &quot;invented&quot; the internet. Here&#39;s what he actually said:

During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. -- Al Gore

Okay, so maybe Al Gore didn&#39;t invent the internet... but he DID invent the environment [youtu.be].

Gore never said he invented the Internet.  This came from a story by Declan McCullagh in Wired News, mocking Gore for taking credit for the success of the Internet.  Gore did deserve credit for his role in supporting the early development of the Internet and was practically the only member of Congress paying attention to the Internet in the early days, when it was primarily an academic/government network.

Dave was a good guy, a kind person with a big heart, and someone who wanted the Internet to work well and benefit society.  Dave&#39;s interesting people email list was pretty influential at one point.  Dave had a type of soft authority, that people paid attention to, because of his combination of technical knowledge, altruistic motives and common sense.

someone who wanted the Internet to work well and benefit society ... he was assassinated by Google?

I expect that will be soon, as they announced their cluelessness and stupidity internationally. Unless there is nothing to steal there?

but you may need to talk in the way that an jury can understand

And it&#39;s actually more straightforward with courts.  The systems for courts are regulated at the state level, even for county and municipal courts, at least in my state.  That means pretty strict compliance with state-level rules and regulations and authorization by state-level officials for things like auditing and inspection.  If a lower court fails to comply, that state entity can compel that lower level jurisdiction to install an entirely segregated computer network entirely air-gapped to the local entity&#39;s LAN, meaning that court employees would have to shuttle data between their local org&#39;s PC and the court PC, with the court PC connected to a court access switch and court firewalling router with a court private network link back to state resources.  And historically they&#39;ve been very behind the times, still using friggin&#39; T1 lines in the 2020s, where 1.544Mb will cost as much as a 10Gb metro ethernet circuit.

State courts allow local entities to have court PCs that can be on the local org&#39;s network with connectivity back to court resources without that special air-gapped network only if the local org accepts auditing and building that connection out to specifications.  Pen testing is not an unreasonable thing to do, and if it&#39;s too easy to break into the building to gain access to PCs or network equipment and too easy to get onto the court&#39;s network then there&#39;s going to be a problem.

Current administration policy seems to be shoot first ... I was going to say ask questions later, but not really. More along the lines of postmortem character assassination to justify excessive force.

Why in the holy fuck is a judicial position at all an elected one?

These officials should be following the law, not following the whimsical needs of an electorate.  There is no way anyone from the lowest police officer to the highest judge should be held to an electorates position on anything.

The electorate should be able to vote the people in to change the laws, they shouldnt be able to vote people in who enforce the laws.  Enforcement of the law should be entirely blind - if the electorate want a law to no

...  vote people in who enforce the laws. That fact is mentioned in about 10,000 Hollywood westerns and modern Tv. dramas:  You should not be surprised.

It is the US principle of small government:  Almost every bureaucratic leader is elected, from city Mayor down to the city&#39;s dog-catcher.  A city election can involve over 90 ballot papers:  No surprise so many US citizens ignore politics.  This and its resulting apathy, makes it easy to manipulate the policies of any city, and of most states.  It&#39;s what Moms for Liberty and other religion-derived

Why in the holy fuck is a judicial position at all an elected one?A) Sheriff isn&#39;t a judicial position, it&#39;s an executive position.B) The county I lived in during high school in Missouri had an elected sheriff who was a convicted felon. He was allowed to be sheriff, even though he wasn&#39;t allowed to carry a gun. (Very inbred area, he was literally related to enough of the voters to vote him into office in hopes that having a steady income would keep him from more hog rustling.)It worked about as well as it sounds.

MAGA is gonna MAGA and they&#39;ll be wrong every single time.

ding someone for going out/over/off scope but the scope is changed / written by non tech staff so it&#39;s not that clear on all part.

&quot;If you continue to behave lawfully, we will continue to arrest you!&quot;

From what I&#39;ve read, it may not have been properly authorized, and that&#39;s the problem.  Someone in government did authorize it, just the dispute was it the right government agency that authorized it.  As an analogy, if the owner of an office building authorizes an intrusion attempt, that doesn&#39;t give you the authority automatically to intrude on particular businesses in that building, and obviously vice versa.  Now, I can speak to the actual circumstance, mostly because it never went to court to actually determine that, but that&#39;s the issue at hand.That&#39;s a weak analogy.  County governments are delegated responsibility by the state.  So in the corporate world, this is the criminal equivalent of Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai authorizing a pentest and YouTube&#39;s lawyers suing the pentesters even after being shown the paperwork, solely because their CEO didn&#39;t sign the paperwork.

The way it worked here. The fullest extent of the law is that charges get dropped and people get a settlement payment.

That one is simple: All you need is excessive stupidity and being utterly full of yourself. Then you prosecute. Then you settle and lose a lot of money. But the money gets paid by the taxpayer, not you. So you can do it again and again and again until the deeply stupid voters notice something.

jobs should not be allowed to look at arrest on their records even more so when cases dropped / not guilty

>&quot; their attorney previously said having a felony arrest on their records made seeking employment difficult.&quot;

How is it that anyone should be allowed to see an ARREST record.  You are presumed innocent and if found not guilty.... ESPECIALLY if the charges were dismissed... that should have no impact on your life.  And if that kind of information can&#39;t be secured properly, then it should be permanently DELETED.

>&quot;It&#39;s possible to have expungement or expunction of arrest/charging records (after paying a lawyer to do that), but it&#39;s not available in every state.&quot;

That should just be everywhere and automatic.  It is bad enough to be innocent and punished by having been arrested, your fingerprints entered and then permanently searched hundreds of times every day the rest of your life, the embarrassment and time and money wasted on courts.  But to have to then go through some process to expunge it is insane.

The pen testers dressed up like burglars and attempted to break in during the middle of the night.  How&#39;d they expect that to end?  I thought it was pretty common knowledge that if you&#39;re trying to get away with shady activities, it&#39;s better to just show up during the day and look like you belong.

How exactly does showing up during the day test whether the building&#39;s security can be penetrated at night? I can tell you put just the entirety of your brainpower into thinking this through.

Simple: These were cheap pen testers. You may also notice they got caught?

One of its meanings. I take it you are not a native speaker?

County Attorney Matt Schultz: &quot;I refuse to learn any lesson from the false arrest and imprisonment of security professionals hired by the state of Iowa because I&#39;m a shithead.&quot;

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

Thursday night, Donald Trump posted something racist enough to break through on social media—a rarity, as his offensive social media posts often go ignored these days. But the visceral, undeniable racism of this particular iteration, and the White House’s initial refusal to express any remorse, pushed it through. And at least one Republican senator expressed disapproval: Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”

The source of all this commotion was a screengrab of a video Trump posted on Truth Social depicting the heads of former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama laughing, open-mouthed, on ape bodies.

The screengrab is real, and the underlying video it comes from is stranger than one might expect. Trump posted the video on Truth Social at 8:44 p.m. on Thursday, and it’s actually largely about election fraud, taking you through baseless and frankly dull conspiracy theory material. But at the end, for about two seconds, it flashes to a bright jungle scene, featuring the laughing Obamas, to the tune of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The last two seconds appeared to be clipped into the video for shock humor, meant to throw a laugh in for the racists who had made it all the way through. There is no mitigating “context” here. With or without the election-fraud part, it was the Black president and first lady, depicted as apes, in one of the oldest and most dehumanizing racist tropes in history.

At first, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to defend the post as being “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King.” She added: “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

And, sure, the original video that those bizarre last seconds were taken from does indeed show Trump as a lion and Democrats as figures that could conceivably be thought of as Lion King characters—Hillary Clinton as Pumbaa, Hakeem Jeffries as Timon—bowing to him. But there are no ape characters in the Lion King. The video is generated by A.I., and is not in the animated style of the 1993 animated film but is instead standard A.I. slop. Perhaps the A.I. added in the additional characters to muddle the racism of depicting the Obamas as apes, but the fact remains that it opens with the scene of the Obamas, and lingers on it longer than the others.

And the creator of the video is not known for his delicacy or tact. Per the watermark and his own claims on X, the creator, who has Pepe the Frog for an avatar, is the same internet user behind the infamous October slop video of Trump dumping sewage onto protesters from a fighter jet. That video shocked people for its raw animosity toward legal protesters practicing their First Amendment rights, as well as for the profoundly juvenile behavior from a sitting president. If you scroll through the creator’s more recent material, it appears he pretty much exclusively makes similarly mindless, low-quality slop content with obvious MAGA messages. Other videos have included Tom Homan as a Jedi fighting protesters in Minneapolis; Don Lemon being arrested and twerking in prison; and Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, being hit with a car and thrown, cartoonishly, into the air.

Even if the original video had no racist intent, which it does, defending the original video makes no sense: Trump didn’t post the original video. He posted a two-second clip of the Obamas as apes. The message is clear.

The one valid defense would be one of ignorance. We can’t know exactly how Trump encountered this video. It’s unclear if Trump watched the entire clip, meaning maybe he didn’t see those two seconds at the end. The White House claimed it was a staffer who actually posted it. But given the highly nonstrategic style of the account’s posting that evening—another post was of an inoffensive TikTok featuring a dog eager to be fed whipped cream, classic Trump stuff—it seems a strange kind of post for a staffer.

Much more crucially, the White House left the video up once they learned of the racist section. Trump did not apologize. The White House did eventually take it down, but only after it had been up for 12 hours.

Trump has done and said many other aggressively anti-Black things in his years in the public eye; this video is not the worst. But it still says something profound about the president and his administration that they were made aware of thoroughly ugly racism coming from the president’s own messages and chose not to apologize to Black Americans or correct the error, but instead to turn against the public.

Amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s assault on Minnesota’s immigrant communities, another abuse has drawn less attention: a brazen disregard for judicial limits on his deportation campaign. The courts have determined that in January alone the administration violated at least 96 orders in 74 cases challenging the unlawful detention of immigrants in Minneapolis. The Justice Department has failed to meet its most basic obligations in many of these cases, due to an apparent combination of malice, incompetence, and institutional depletion. Further evidence of its unraveling came on Tuesday, when Julie Le, a government attorney, told Judge Jerry Blackwell, in open court: “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.” Of the backlog in Minneapolis, Le then told Blackwell: “What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Le’s shocking courtroom breakdown and what it reveals about the DOJ’s broader meltdown under Trump’s impossible demands. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Is this the clearest sign yet that for all of its tough talk about going to “war” with “rogue judges,” the DOJ under Trump is in full-on dumpster-fire crisis mode?

Mark Joseph Stern: It’s a sign that the Justice Department is actively collapsing. And it’s important to understand the background here. Blackwell had ordered Le to explain why the government failed to comply with his order demanding the release of a detained immigrant, as well as why she shouldn’t be personally held in contempt for defying that order. Her response was that she had been given an impossible task. It turned out that the Trump administration had assigned her to the U.S. attorney’s office to handle 88 immigration cases in under a month, a crushing load. That overwhelming surge of immigration cases is happening all over the country, but it’s especially acute in Minneapolis because of the ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities there.

But this is a problem entirely of the administration’s own making. Back in July, the government unilaterally reinterpreted federal immigration law to require the detention of any immigrant who was never legally admitted into the country, rather than allowing them to be released and given a bond hearing. So even if they have lawful presence today, they must be detained indefinitely. As our friend Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, courts have overwhelmingly rejected that reinterpretation: More than 350 decisions by 160 different judges in about 50 different courts have all found that that interpretation is obviously wrong. But because the Supreme Court took away universal injunctions in the birthright citizenship case in its most recent term, no single court can block the government from enforcing this position nationwide, so it keeps trying, over and over again.

That means the government is illegally detaining thousands of immigrants based on an egregious misreading of the law. Those immigrants are flooding the courts with habeas petitions for release. There were 581 habeas cases in Minnesota in January alone—an exponential increase of unmanageable proportions. The courts are overwhelmingly granting these petitions, but then the immigrants are not being released, because the DOJ doesn’t have enough lawyers on hand to process all of the rulings and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually releasing people. So that is the background that led this attorney, Le, to have a breakdown in court and say: I am unable to do the job that has been asked of me.

I want to flag that this isn’t a factual dispute. It’s not a legal dispute. It’s not a pound-on-the-table dispute. It’s a decision by the Justice Department to not have enough lawyers, and to make the system collapse under the weight of indifference and apathy. Since Trump’s second inauguration, you and I have talked a lot about judges who are mad, frustrated, and venting at Trump lawyers. This is something different. It’s scaled up massively. This is an admonition from a judge saying that the entire system of justice cannot be sustained this way, and he is watching it veer off the rails.

You see that in something else Blackwell said on Tuesday: “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.” He’s saying the government cannot create a crisis by detaining way too many immigrants illegally, then claim that it is too overwhelmed to comply with orders releasing those immigrants. That is such a vital point for a judge to make when we know that the Trump administration’s strategy is always Flood the zone. Shock and awe. Inundate the opposition with an endless blitz. And in a very real sense here, the opposition is the judiciary. It’s judges like Blackwell who are willing to stand up and say: This is illegal. You are not allowed to do this.

This is the same DOJ that’s out there on X, advertising for lawyers. Chad Mizelle, former DOJ chief of staff, literally tweeted last month: “If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me.” This isn’t freaking Dairy Queen! But one way to destroy an institution from within is to create a crisis, right? They created a crisis with the immigration sweeps. Then they created a double crisis by saying, “Well, Justice Department lawyers just can’t handle all the work.” It’s a way of signaling that the whole institution is broken.

And that’s the point. If it’s understood that DOJ lawyers suck and there’s nothing a judge can do to enforce his will, the takeaway for the public is: I guess the justice system doesn’t matter. I guess the Constitution doesn’t matter. So Julie Le freaking out in open court doesn’t get us where we need to go. We need to take the next step, which is to say that they are breaking systems and exulting in it. And that’s the part that we are not reckoning with.

I agree. These assistant U.S. attorney positions used to be super prestigious and competitive. They were a launchpad to an elite career in the law. Now Trump officials are basically pleading with people to apply for them by DM on Elon Musk’s Nazi-hangout site. There has been a mass exodus from the Justice Department—thousands of attorneys have fled since Trump returned to office. And of course the White House has purged almost every lawyer who worked on Jan. 6 cases on top of that. And now the administration can’t fill these positions. But this was the inevitable consequence of Trump’s abolishing the traditional independence of the DOJ. The department now works directly for him, including the prosecution of his political adversaries.

On top of that, the attorneys who remain in their positions have to defend these unlawful detentions, racist arrests, and other unconstitutional behavior. They’re being pulled off actual criminal cases to prosecute immigrants instead. Real violent crimes are going unprosecuted so that the deportation machine can be fed. It would take an army of immigration lawyers to handle all of this work that the DOJ has now created for itself. And nobody with a conscience wants to do this stuff. I want to quote another thing Le said in the courtroom, after Blackwell asked her about the government snatching people up in Minnesota, flying them to a detention center across the country, then not bringing them back for hearings. Le said: “I share the same concern with you, Your Honor. I am not white, as you can see, and my family’s at risk as any other people that might get picked up too. So I share the same concern, and I took that concern to heart.”

Here is a lawyer saying: Wait, what am I doing here? Why am I defending these racist policies? I shouldn’t be here either. My own family is at risk because of the policies that I’m defending. When that kind of breakdown of the system is happening in open court, of course there aren’t enough lawyers to do all of this work, because only the most racist, nativist freaks will remain. And there aren’t enough good lawyers who are also racist freaks to carry all of the weight that the DOJ is putting on itself.

To that end, we should note that Le has reportedly been removed from her post. But I think that the point we’re both trying to make is that we learned this lesson from Elon Musk, right? The easiest way to decimate government functioning is to decimate government itself. And so this is an act of contempt, but it’s also an act of power. It’s saying: You can’t make me, and I don’t care.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Asia In Brief The Commissioner of Police in the Indian city of Hyderabad, population 11 million, has called for AI agents to be issued with identity cards – or at least their digital equivalent.

In a lengthy post on X, commissioner V.C. Sajjanar noted “Autonomous robot agents have entered highly critical sectors such as banks, hospitals, and power grids. However, with these digital agents performing tasks independently without human intervention, there is widespread concern that we are at risk of losing control over them.”

Sajjanar worries that agents can make mistakes and also raised “a threat of cybercriminals hijacking the behavior of these agents and forcing them to commit wrongdoings.”

He therefore suggests every AI agent “must have a precise &#39;Digital Identity.&#39;”

“Just as a human has an ID card in an organization, these software agents must also have identification. Which agent opened which file? When did it make changes? To whom did it send information? Every such movement must be recorded (Logging). Because of this, if an accident happens by mistake, we can immediately identify which agent caused it and rectify the issue.”

The People’s Bank of China last week strengthened its ban on cryptocurrency, and tried to extend its ruling across borders.

The central bank issued a Notice on Further Preventing and Handling Risks Related to Virtual Currencies that re-iterates Beijing does not consider cryptocurrencies a legal means of exchange. The new Notice adds two more rules.

One regulates “tokenization of real-world assets,” the practice of using digital certificates to allow fractional ownership of assets by issuing tokens. That practice is now illegal in most applications, and heavily regulated in the few permitted uses.

The other new rule bans issuance of stablecoins tied to China’s currency. Beijing will have little trouble making that stick at home, but there’s little China’s government can do if foreign entities choose to create a stablecoin tied to the Yuan.

Australian hardware chain Bunnings has successfully challenged a decision it violated shoppers’ privacy by using facial recognition without permission in its stores.

Readers may remember that the retailer justified use of facial recognition on grounds that it wanted to detect a small number of people known to have acted violently in its stores or to be associated with organized crime. The company claimed it processed images it captured in 0.00417 seconds, and deleted most at the end of that period, so shoppers’ privacy was preserved.

Those arguments prevailed last week in a tribunal decision that found the retailer’s use of facial recognition was reasonable given the risks it faced and the security measures implemented to protect shoppers.

However, the hardware barn was also found to breach some of Australia’s privacy principles and told to stop that.

Reuters last week reported talks have taken place between Ant Group and Indian authorities about linking their Alipay and UPI payment systems.

If the report is correct and the talks succeed, it will mean two payment schemes with over 1.5 billion combined users become interoperable. Such an arrangement would also represent a substantial thawing of China-India relations.

Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University last week showed off the island nation’s first locally designed and built full-sized aircraft, an advanced electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) technology demonstrator.

The craft has eight rotors and can take off and land vertically “from any confined space” that can accommodate its eight-meter wingspan.

Professor Lam Khin Yong, NTU’s Vice President for industry, said the demonstrator shows electric aircraft of this sort have “potential to support future intracity and intercity mobility, particularly in Asia’s densely populated cities, where safe and well-designed aircraft will be critical for the movement of people and cargo.”

Investment firm KKR, together with Singtel, last week decided to spend $5.1 billion to acquire the 82 percent of ST Telemedia Global Data Centres they did not already own.

KKR will own 75 percent of the business, leaving the remainder to Singtel.

ST Telemedia Global Data Centres currently operates over 100 datacenters with collective capacity of 2.3 gigawatts across 12 countries. The company has a pipeline of another 1.7 gigawatts under construction. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/linux_6_19_7_named/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Penguin emperor Linus Torvalds has announced the next version of the Linux kernel will be version 7.0, a matter of some small interest, because it continues his convention of not using version numbers he can’t count on his fingers and toes, and perhaps cements a numbering convention that sees kernel series end with version 19.

Linux kernel version numbering became more predictable with the 3.x series, which saw the release of 19 kernels before ticking over to 4.0.

Torvalds had some fun along the way, dubbing version 3.11 Linux for Workgroups, a reference to the name Microsoft gave Windows 3.11. He later pondered using version 4.0 as a special release dedicated to cleaning up bugs.

He then released 20 versions of the 4.x kernel series, and chat on the Linux kernel mailing list then included mention of version 4.21, before Torvalds decided to rename the next release version 5.0 because “I ran out of fingers and toes to count on.&quot; He&#39;s also often said that version numbers are essentially meaningless. An x.0 release is no more significant than any other, and usually less important than whichever release kernel maintainers decide will receive long-term support.

The 5.x series ended after 19 releases, and now the 6.x series will do the same as Torvalds on Sunday announced the next release will be version 7.0, again because “I&#39;m getting to the point where I&#39;m being confused by large numbers (almost running out of fingers and toes again).”

Torvalds’ post also references “some random sporting event” that he says will bring the USA “to a complete standstill later today watching the latest batch of televised commercials.”

“The betting man would expect them all to be AI-generated, but maybe some enterprising company decides to buck the trend? Doubtful, but there&#39;s always a slight chance,” he wrote, in what The Register assumes is a reference to the Superbowl.

Torvalds appears not to be a fan, and urges those outside the USA to take version 6.19 of the kernel for a spin.

Per the kernel-watchers at Phoronix, the new release includes a Live Update Orchestrator that allows kernel upgrades without disrupting virtual machines, and adds encrypted comms between PCIe devices and VMs.

As usual, the release includes many additions that improve access to features in recent Intel and AMD silicon, plus improved support for emerging RISC-V and Chinese processors, plus tweaks to filesystems.

Among the many networking changes, one that removes a busy lock means some data transfers could mean queues clear more quickly and data flows up to four times faster than is currently possible under some circumstances.

The release is yours for the downloading here. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Infosec In Brief So-hot-right-now AI assistant OpenClaw, which is very much not secure right now, has teamed up with security scanning service VirusTotal.

The tie-up means “skills” in the ClawHub – custom plugins for the OpenClaw assistant – will be scanned by over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blocklisting services.

“OpenClaw skills are powerful. They extend what your AI agent can do—from controlling smart home devices to managing finances to automating workflows. But with that power comes risk,” the assistant’s developers wrote in a Saturday post that explains the decision to work with VirusTotal.

The post points out that working with the scanning service won’t totally secure OpenClaw.

“Let’s be clear: this is not a silver bullet,” the developers wrote. “VirusTotal scanning won’t catch everything. A skill that uses natural language to instruct an agent to do something malicious won’t trigger a virus signature. A carefully crafted prompt injection payload won’t show up in a threat database.”

Fallout from the Salt Typhoon hack of leading American telcos continues, and one US Senator isn&#39;t convinced that victim companies are being honest.

Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, last week sent a letter to her Republican counterpart demanding the CEOs of AT&T and Verizon appear before the group to explain why they keep withholding security assessments performed in the wake of 2024 revelations of what&#39;s been called the worst telecom hack in US history.

Chinese-linked hackers with Salt Typhoon reportedly had extensive access to the three carriers’ networks, plus others they used to spy on customers, including officials at US government agencies. Telcos supposedly reinforced their network perimeters and ejected Salt Typhoon after the intrusions were made public, but Cantwell has her doubts.

&quot;The FBI and other federal agencies … detailed guidance on how to mitigate the risk from Advanced Persistent Threat actors like Salt Typhoon,&quot; Cantwell wrote to Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). &quot;However, reports indicate the telecommunications providers have taken few protective actions thus far due to the costs.&quot;

AT&T and Verizon have refused to release security assessments conducted by Mandiant in the wake of the attacks. Cantwell said the documents detail steps the telcos took to secure their networks and eject Salt Typhoon. Not only have the pair declined to make the reports public after acknowledging they had been conducted, but Cantwell said both stymied her efforts to get copies from Mandiant, too.

&quot;Both AT&T and Verizon have chosen not to cooperate, which raises serious questions about the extent to which Americans who use these networks remain exposed to unacceptable risk,&quot; Cantwell argued. &quot;I believe we must hear directly from the CEOs of AT&T and Verizon so Americans have clarity and confidence about the security of their communications.&quot;

Checkpoint researchers have spotted a previously-unknown Chinese cyber espionage group they rate as &quot;active and capable.&quot;

Checkpoint named the group Amaranth-Dragon and believes it is targeting countries in Southeast Asia with narrow, focused attacks that suggest a desire to collect intelligence on government institutions and law enforcement agencies.

The group is quick to attack recently disclosed vulnerabilities and campaigns by referencing recent newsworthy events that it hopes will lure victims into interacting with dangerous content.

Checkpoint noted the group was particularly quick to make use of a compression vulnerability in WinRAR that was first reported in September 2025, incorporating it into campaigns within days of its disclosure.

Checkpoint believes Amaranth-Dragon is likely affiliated with APT-41, a well-known Chinese cyber espionage group that typically targets foreign nations for intel-gathering purposes.

Ukrainian authorities last week arrested four people for stealing more than ₴13M ($302,000) between 2023 and 2024 from banks using a rather convoluted scheme involving fake businesses, point of sale (POS) terminals, and bogus refunds.

The scheme started, according to Ukrainian cyber police, with the registration of businesses that acquired POS terminals from banks for use in their supposedly legitimate operations. Terminals were installed at &quot;previously prepared premises&quot; that served as fake business locations, and the gang made purchases of nonexistent goods from the businesses they registered.

At that point, the crooks would trigger refunds for the things they didn&#39;t buy, which is where the crime comes in.

&quot;Given the peculiarities of automatic transaction processing, such refunds were compensated at the expense of banking institutions, which allowed the perpetrators to illegally obtain funds,&quot; Ukrainian law enforcement explained. &quot;The stolen money was legalized by converting it into cryptocurrency and then exchanging it for cash, in particular using P2P trading on crypto exchanges.&quot;

The gang members each face 12 years in prison if convicted.

Microsoft Exchange alternative SmarterMail isn’t living up to its name after it revealed several vulnerabilities in recent weeks.

It started on January 26th, with 2 CVEs in SmarterTools&#39; SmarterMail software, CVE-2026-23760 (CVSS 9.3) and CVE-2025-52691 (CVSS 10.0), both being added to CISA&#39;s catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities on the same day.

The first, 23760, allows an attacker to gain administrator privileges to SmarterMail instances due to an authentication bypass vulnerability in the platform&#39;s password reset API, while 52691 offers the chance for remote code execution by abusing an unrestricted file upload issue.

Fast forward to last week, and CISA added a third issue (CVE-2026-24423, CVSS 9.3) to its KEV catalog. This flaw is an authentication problem in SmarterMail’s ConnectToHub API, which could allow an attacker to gain command execution on an affected server by redirecting it to a malicious HTTP server used to deliver malicious commands.

CISA is aware of the vulnerability being used in ransomware campaigns, so get those security updates deployed.

A woman and her mother were abducted in France last week Wednesday by criminals hoping to ransom the pair to the woman&#39;s partner, an executive at a cryptocurrency company.

The criminals got nothing , as a man freed the kidnapped pair after hearing their cries for help.

According to French outlet Le Dauphiné, this is the third such abduction and cryptocurrency ransom demand of late, with an elderly couple abducted in mid-January, and an elderly man kidnapped late last month. In the other cases, children of the abductees were involved in the cryptocurrency space. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Developers looking to gain a better understanding of machine learning inference on local hardware can fire up a new llama engine.

Software developer Leonardo Russo has released llama3pure, which incorporates three standalone inference engines. There&#39;s a pure C implementation for desktops, a pure JavaScript implementation for Node.js, and a pure JavaScript version for web browsers that don&#39;t require WebAssembly.

&quot;All versions are compatible with the Llama and Gemma architectures,&quot; Russo explained to The Register in an email. &quot;The goal is to provide a dependency-free, isolated alternative in both C and JavaScript capable of reading GGUF files and processing prompts.&quot;

GGUF stands for GPT-Generated Unified Format; it is a common format for distributing machine learning models.

Llama3pure is not intended as a replacement for llama.cpp, a widely used inference engine for running local models that&#39;s significantly faster at responding to prompts. Llama3pure is an educational tool.

&quot;I see llama3pure as a more flexible alternative to llama.cpp specifically when it comes to architectural transparency and broad hardware compatibility,&quot; Russo explained. &quot;While llama.cpp is the standard for high-performance optimization, it involves a complex ecosystem of dependencies and build configurations, llama3pure takes a different approach.&quot;

Russo believes developers can benefit from having an inference engine in a single, human-readable file that makes evident the logic of file-parsing and token generation.

&quot;The project&#39;s main purpose is to provide an inference engine contained within a single file of pure code,&quot; he said. &quot;By removing external dependencies and layers of abstraction, it allows developers to grasp the entire execution flow – from GGUF parsing to the final token – without jumping between files or libraries. It&#39;s built for those who need to understand exactly what the hardware is doing.&quot;

Russo also sees utility for situations where the developer is running legacy software or hardware, where client-side WebAssembly isn&#39;t an option, and where having an isolated tool without the potential for future dependency conflicts might be desirable.

The C and Node.js engines, he said, have been tested with Llama models up to 8 billion parameters and with Gemma models up to 4 billion parameters. The main limiting factor is the physical RAM required to host model weights.

The RAM required to run machine learning models on local hardware is roughly 1GB per billion parameters when the model is quantized at 8 bits. Double or halve the precision and you double or halve the memory required. Models are commonly quantized at 16 bits, so for a 1 billion-parameter model, 2GB would typically be required.

According to Russo, the calculation for GGUF weights is different.

&quot;GGUF weights are loaded directly into RAM, which usually means the RAM usage matches the entire file size,&quot; he explained. &quot;You can reduce the context window size by passing a specific parameter (context_size) – a feature supported by most inference engines, including the three I designed. While reducing the context window size this is a common &#39;trick&#39; to save RAM when running models locally, it also means the AI won&#39;t &#39;remember&#39; as much as it was originally designed to.&quot;

He also said that llama3pure is presently focused on single-turn inference. He expects to implement chat history state management at a later date.

For daily work, Russo says he uses Gemma 3 as a personal assistant, powered by his C-based inference engine, to ensure that sensitive data is handled privately and offline.

&quot;For a coding assistant, I recommend Gemma 3 27B,&quot; he said. &quot;Regarding the latency concerns, while local models were historically slow, running optimized versions on modern hardware now provides an experience very close to cloud-based models like Claude and without the need to pay for such a service.&quot;

While Russo expects common general use cases for AI assistance will continue to rely on cloud-hosted models, he foresees developers and businesses looking increasingly at local AI. While developer machines with 32GB or 48GB of RAM may lack the context window available with cloud-hosted models, they provide security and privacy without being dependent on service providers.

Asked how he feels as a developer about the AI transition, Russo said he expects developers to eventually transition to AI supervisors.

&quot;Since AI models present answers with high confidence – even when incorrect – a human expert must remain in the loop to verify the output,&quot; he said. &quot;Technical knowledge will not become obsolete; rather, it will become increasingly vital for auditing AI-generated work.

&quot;While job titles may change, senior developers will always be necessary to maintain these systems, creating a workflow significantly faster than human-only development. For junior and mid-level developers, AI offers the opportunity to learn faster than previous generations. If managed correctly, AI can facilitate a significant leap in the industry&#39;s intellectual evolution.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is &quot;enterprise IT&quot; marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.

During a coffee break at this year&#39;s CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won&#39;t name them – we&#39;re sure that they&#39;d prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.

This vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we&#39;ve had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.

They called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:

Adding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…

Containers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren&#39;t a deployment method. You shouldn&#39;t need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you&#39;re not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren&#39;t competent enough to deploy a container either.

Kubernetes: If you don&#39;t need containers, then you don&#39;t need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won&#39;t happen, so you won&#39;t lose any of that imaginary business.

(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)

The cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company&#39;s important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.

(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There&#39;s Just Somebody Else&#39;s Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)

Anything &quot;as a service&quot; – it doesn&#39;t matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don&#39;t even get servers, just OS instances. That&#39;s even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don&#39;t even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it&#39;s running; you don&#39;t get software, and you don&#39;t even know what data you have or how it&#39;s stored – you&#39;re paying for access to your own stuff.

(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch&#39;s Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)

The blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world&#39;s slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they&#39;re longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.

Which brings us round to &quot;generative AI&quot; or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can&#39;t be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s predictive text turned up to 11. It can&#39;t even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:

The &quot;i&quot; in &quot;LLM&quot; stands for intelligence.

(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)

Honestly, we can&#39;t fault any of this reasoning. We&#39;ve looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it&#39;s not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it &quot;relatively new,&quot; it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google&#39;s Gmail in 2004.

Cloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.

Whoever &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot; is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn&#39;t come to The Reg&#39;s attention until 2011.

2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.

Kubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running &quot;Borg&quot; internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.

2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS

2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD&#39;s Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme

2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world

2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff

All right, yes, rather more than 15 years. &quot;A century of tech BS&quot; seems a bit over the top when it&#39;s only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.

Obviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers&#39; religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®

            <h2>Machine learning could yield faster, cheaper lithium-ion battery development</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/08/machine_learning_battery_development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scientists have developed a machine learning method that could dramatically slash the cost and energy required to develop new lithium-ion batteries that the modern world is becoming increasingly reliant.

Predicting a new battery design&#39;s lifesapn – and its engineering applications – is a major industry bottleneck. Brute-force testing of prototypes by repeatedly charging and discharging until they near their end-of-life threshold can take months or even years, consuming vast amounts of electricity at huge cost.

One study estimated that current and future lithium battery designs might require 130,000 GWh in energy from 2023 until 2040 if no changes were made to the development process. That&#39;s roughly half the annual electricity generated in California (278,338 GWh).

Research published in the scientific journal Nature this week describes a new approach to machine learning in battery development which the authors claim could save 98 percent of the time and 95 percent of the cost compared to conventional methods.

It shows a &quot;great potential for tackling a key bottleneck in battery development,&quot; University of Connecticut associate professor Chao Hu said in an accompanying article.

The process developed by University of Michigan postdoctoral researcher Jiawei Zhang and his team combined iterative elements to reduce the data required to make accurate predictions.

The so-called Discovery Learning framework builds on a 2019 study that showed a machine learning model exploiting early-life data from prototype battery testing could be used to predict battery lifetimes with less than 15 percent mean error on test sets, considered highly accurate.

Zhang and colleagues split the earlier method into three distinct elements. A Learner module picks prototypes of new designs likely to offer useful data to improve predictive accuracy. After early testing of these prototypes, the Interpreter module employs models of physical properties to analyze this data together with historical full-life data from existing batteries. Lastly, the Oracle module uses that output to predict the lifetimes of the newly tested prototypes. Crucially, that information is then fed back into the Learner module for selecting the next set of prototypes to physically test.

&quot;A key novelty of the Discovery Learning model is that it updates itself using lifetimes predicted by the Oracle, rather than by using experimentally measured lifetimes, avoiding the need for time-consuming full-life battery testing,&quot; Hu said.

However, he points out that it remains unclear how well the Discovery Learning framework will perform when a new battery design deviates substantially from those of the batteries that are available to provide training data.

&quot;More broadly, before the framework can be adopted for general use, further validation is needed to see how well it holds up for batteries used in real-world conditions, for example, at variable temperatures and under different electrical loads,&quot; Hu said.

Nonetheless, with the current global value of batteries for EVs, laptops, and a spectrum of other applications worth $120 billion – and expected to increase to nearly $500 billion in 2030 – even slight savings in development costs could make a difference. ®

No, that isn’t Alexander Skarsgård playing around with Jony Ive and OpenAI’s first ChatGPT hardware gadget.

As if OpenAI didn’t have enough drama around the Super Bowl and advertising, as the game wound down, word spread of a “leaked” ad that actually wasn’t leaked at all; it was just a fake. Screenshots of a now-deleted Reddit thread told the tale of a frustrated employee who, while posting about how upset they were because the ad they’d worked on didn’t run, accidentally leaked the entire advertisement video, seemingly showing Murderbot star Alexander Skarsgård with what could have been OpenAI’s first hardware device, portrayed as a shiny orb that went with some wraparound earbuds.

OpenAI president Greg Brockman commented on X with a tweet calling the story “fake news,” and OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum Rémy wrote, “this is totally fake.”

Looking at it carefully, the fact that the account that “found” the advertisement is brand new was remarkably convenient. The “wineheda” Reddit account behind the original post is now deleted, but a search through the Internet Archive reveals that just a year ago, the person behind it was looking to grow their business as a bookkeeper in Santa Monica — it would be quite a career shift to suddenly become someone working on ads for OpenAI and Jony Ive in time for Super Bowl LX.

Whoever was behind this hoax had been working on it for some time and approached spreading their story on multiple fronts. Max Weinbach tweeted screenshots of an email he’d received a week ago proposing promotion of a tweet about an OpenAI hardware teaser ad featuring Alexander Skarsgård, which apparently came with a real $1,146.12 payment. And AdAge reporter Gillian Follett tweeted earlier today about a “fake headline” attributed to her, falsely portraying a story about OpenAI changing its Super Bowl ad, while OpenAI CMO Kate Rouch mentioned an “entire fake website” trying to back up the same thing.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Super Bowl LX is nearly here, with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the New England Patriots. While Bad Bunny will be the star of the halftime show, AI could be the star of the commercial breaks, much like crypto was a few years ago.

Last year’s Super Bowl featured a Google Gemini ad that fumbled a Gouda cheese stat, and this year’s game is already slated to include an ad for Anthropic’s AI platform that takes jabs at its competitors, namely OpenAI. AI-generated ads could make an appearance, too.

Super Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30PM ET/3:30PM PT on Sunday, February 8th, and is being broadcast on NBC and Peacock.

This 30-second Super Bowl ad dangled handles on the new AI.com platform with names like “Mark,” “Sam,” and “Elon.” If you’re not sure what it is, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek says he’s leading this platform also, and that it will “mainstream AI agents and AGI in the same way he led mass consumer adoption of cryptocurrency.”

Remember what happened after Crypto.com’s Super Bowl ad in 2022?

This Super Bowl ad pulls together a grab bag of global celebrities (Lady Gaga, Trevor Noah, Jisoo, Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko) to ask which one is their favorite.

Redfin is doing a geoguessing-themed game of skill to give away a million-dollar house in its app, based on clues found in its Super Bowl ad, and Rainbolt is part of the promo — but he’s not allowed to help, based on the rules here.

Meanwhile, Salesforce’s Mr. Beast ad promises a million-dollar giveaway based on the clues in its 30-second ad.

And neither one had noticeable AI. T-Mobile brought the actual Backstreet Boys in, while Coinbase broke things up with a weird karaoke-style presentation of “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” to highlight its crypto exchange without actually mentioning crypto.

After so many people hated Coke’s AI holiday ad, Pepsi’s Taika Waititi-directed Super Bowl ad looks like standard CG, as a bear chooses Pepsi over Coke in a blind taste test.

Pepsi exec Gustavo Reyna told AdWeek that it focused on human touch because “f there’s something we care about and we believe in, it’s in the craft and the creativity of our people, our talent, and our partners.”

The round of Big Game ads Anthropic previewed earlier this week set Sam Altman off, as he called them “clearly dishonest.”

Now, while the original ad says, “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,” nodding to OpenAI’s plans, the one that aired replaced it with a new tagline: “There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them.”

As OpenAI and Anthropic feud over AI advertising, both companies are running Super Bowl ads for their AI products. After OpenAI boss Sam Altman said its ad would focus on “builders,” OpenAI debuted this ad about its AI coding agent, Codex.

ChatGPT is much more well-known, but enterprise use of tools like Codex is probably where OpenAI’s money is.

Just before kickoff, Disney and Pixar previewed their next CG family flick, Hoppers. As we’ve heard and seen in a teaser trailer, this one follows a world where people put their minds into 3D-printed versions of animals to try and live among them. It’s coming to theaters on March 6th, although the YouTube description mentions an early viewing window on February 28th.

The first Super Bowl ad from SpaceX apparently didn’t have enough time left in production to mention its newly-joined X / xAI elements, but it is promoting the idea of global satellite internet.

The adaptation of Andy Weir’s best-selling novel is hitting theaters on March 20th. But, before that, we’re getting our clearest look yet at Rocky, the alien that befriends Gosling’s Ryland Grace. This trailer really ramps up the drama and… wait, why is Grace teaching Rocky to dance?

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek is getting in on the Super Bowl AI commercial break craze by launching his new AI.com website during the game. A press release describes the site as a way for users to “generate a private, personal AI agent that doesn’t just answer questions, but actually operates on the user’s behalf.”

Hemsworth’s latest action scene isn’t in an Avengers movie, but a stand-off with Amazon’s AI assistant, which he fears is planning elaborate ways to kill him. Maybe Ultron is still fresh in the Thor actor’s mind. It’s far from the only ad for AI in this year’s Super Bowl.

Sam Altman responded to Anthropic’s new Super Bowl ad in an X post on Wednesday, saying the OpenAI competitor’s campaign is “clearly dishonest,” and called it “on brand” for Anthropic to “doublespeak.” “We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” he wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.” You can read his statement in full, below.

Anthropic, founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI research executives who reportedly left over differences in opinions on AI safety and mission, doesn’t mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name in its Super Bowl Sunday ad campaign. But in contrast to OpenAI’s January news that it would soon start testing ads, Anthropic says, “Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

“Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,” is a clear shot at OpenAI’s decision to bring ads to ChatGPT without mentioning it by name. There are four commercials in the campaign, with one trimmed to thirty-seconds to air during the Super Bowl at a cost of around $8 million.

The NFL has added prediction markets to its list of “prohibited categories” for commercials in Super Bowl LX. However, as Front Office Sports points out, sports betting isn’t on that list. While there will be limits on the number of sports bettor ads allowed, the league seems to be drawing a distinction between the two categories.

Free accounts are being prompted to “Unlock lyrics with Premium.”

Free YouTube Music accounts are now seeing their access to lyrics limited, according to multiple reports. Google started testing lyrics as an exclusive feature for Premium users in September, but it appears that it’s now receiving a wider rollout. It seems that free users will be limited to viewing lyrics for five songs per month, though we’ve reached out to Google for confirmation.

Once that limit is reached, users will only be able to see the first couple of lines. Everything beyond that will be blurred out, and they’ll be prompted to “Unlock lyrics with Premium.” The banner warning users about their limited lyric views remaining appears prominently when you open the tab, complete with a countdown.

One requires labels on AI-generated “news” and the other puts a pause on new data center construction.

New York’s state legislature is set to consider a pair of bills that would require labels on AI-generated content and would put a three-year pause on new data center construction.

The New York Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Requirements in News Act (NY FAIR News Act, for short) would require that any news “substantially composed, authored, or created through the use of generative artificial intelligence” carry a disclaimer. It would also require that any content created using AI be reviewed and approved by a human with “editorial control” before being published.

Beyond that, the bill requires organizations to disclose to newsroom employees how and when AI is being used. And it would call for safeguards that prevent confidential information, especially about sources, from being accessed by AI.

Meanwhile, S9144 “imposes a moratorium on the issuance of permits for new data centers” for at least three years. The bill cites rising electric and gas rates for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. National Grid New York says that requests for “large load” connections have tripled in just one year, with at least 10 gigawatts of demand expected to be added in the next five years. There are already over 130 data centers in New York, according to Data Center Map.

The state just approved a 9-percent rate increase for Con Edison customers over the next three years, and electric bills are soaring around the country as datacenters put strain on the grid.

            <div id="article-text">It’s vicious, dancey, and utterly captivating.

It’s vicious, dancey, and utterly captivating.

Often, I focus on recommending older media that isn’t currently getting a ton of attention. But this week, I can’t stop listening to the new Mandy, Indiana album long enough to even think about anything else. It’s early still, obviously, but URGH is my favorite release of 2026 so far. The band that I fell in love with on I’ve Seen a Way has found an entirely new gear.

Frontwoman Valentine Caulfield is even more uncompromising. Most of the lyrics are in French, but even if you don’t know what she’s saying, you can feel the contempt. On “Magazine” she’s spitting in your face as she seethes:

Where on earlier songs she would strut or rant, on URGH she rages. The wordless fury of the album title is captured in the threatening hiss of her delivery, which culminates in the full-throated English-language roar of “I’ll Ask Her,” which closes with her repeatedly shouting:

Women cover their drinks around him, but they’re all fucking crazy, man

And his ex went to the police, but they’re all fucking crazy, man

He brags about getting them drunk, but they’re all fucking crazy, man

Yeah, your friend’s a fucking rapist, but they’re all fucking crazy, man

The instrumentation feels like it’s being blasted directly into your face through a bullhorn. Drummer Alex Macdougall has sharpened the edges of his approach. URGH finds him locking into grooves so tight they could strangle; LCD Soundsystem dance-punk abandon meets the ferocity of Coralie Fargeat’s Revenge. On I’ve Seen a Way the synths and guitar were dissonant, resolutely uncomfortable. On URGH, they’re corrosive, as if being in the room while it was being recorded was physically painful. But it’s also somehow catchier.

What makes the album so impressive is that the band has compromised on nothing, made their sound more confrontational, and yet unlocked something that turns these blasts of noise and fury into genuinely infectious songs. I can’t get tracks like “Magazine,” “Try Saying,” “Life Hex,” and “Cursive” out of my head. I find myself unconsciously moving to the avalanche grooves even when the record isn’t on.

URGH is everything that made Mandy, Indiana great, but more. The heavy bits are heavier. The noisy parts are noisier. The catchy parts are catchier. And the groovy parts are groovier. They’re at the forefront of a growing cadre of bands that take inspiration from ‘80s no wave, ‘90s industrial, and ‘00s dance punk to create something righteous, political, and foreboding, but also incredibly danceable.

Mandy, Indiana’s URGH is available on BandCamp and most streaming platforms, including Qobuz, Deezer, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and Spotify.

An updated iPad and iPad Air should land around the same time.

Almost exactly one year after launching the iPhone 16e, Apple is preparing to launch the 17e, according to Mark Gurman. The iPhone 17e will feature an upgraded A19 chip from the iPhone 17 lineup, plus MagSafe charging, and move Apple’s in-house cellular chips. Just as importantly, the company apparently plans to keep the price at $599, despite soaring RAM and storage prices.

Gurman says Apple is planning to pitch the iPhone 17e aggressively in emerging markets and to enterprises. He claims that, with almost no changes expected from the Pixel 10a and Samsung focused on the higher end of the market, Apple sees an opening.

We also expect Apple to launch an updated iPad and iPad Air around the same time, alongside the spec-bumped MacBook Pros and a MacBook Air with an M5 processor. The base-model iPad will be moving to an A18 chip, which means it will support Apple Intelligence, while the iPad Air will move to an M4 and switch to an OLED display.

Gurman says most of these launches should be expected by early March.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <h2>Three questions about next-generation nuclear power, answered</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

Market reaction has been noticeable: UiPath’s shares ticked higher in early trading after the announcement, suggesting investors see value in bolstering the company’s presence in financial-services automation. The acquisition underscores a broader trend in enterprise software where automation and AI are no longer siloed tools but woven into core business functions like risk and compliance.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/kembara-closes-e750m-first-close-to-fuel-growth-of-european-deep-tech-startups">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.
