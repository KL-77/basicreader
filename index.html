            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Black holes have long captured the imagination of both scientists and the general public. These exotic objects—once thought to be merely hypothetical—have also conceptually inspired countless artists all over the world. A generous sampling of such work is featured in Conjuring the Void: The Art of Black Holes.

Author Lynn Gamwell spent ten years as director of the New York Academy of Science’s Gallery of Art and Science. She has an extensive background writing about the intersection of math, art, and science. So she was a natural choice to speak at the annual conference of Harvard’s interdisciplinary Black Hole Initiative a few years ago. Gamwell focused her talk on the art of black holes, and thus the seeds for what would become Conjuring the Void were sown.

“I was just astounded at how much art there is [about black holes], and I was specifically interested in Asian art,” Gamwell told Ars. “There’s just something about the concept of a black hole that resonates with the Eastern tradition. So many of the themes—the science of black holes, void, nothingness, being inescapable—relate to the philosophy of Buddhism and Taoism and so on.”

Gamwell opens the book by chronologically summarizing key developments in the science of black holes, from Isaac Newton and John Mitchell’s 1783 concept of “dark stars,” to the predictions of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and such Nobel Prize-winning discoveries as the LIGO collaboration’s 2016 detection of gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes, and the Event Horizon Telescope’s first image of a black hole in 2019. That discussion provides a springboard to showcase all the examples of black-hole-inspired art Gamwell unearthed during her research, from early 20th century illustrations to cutting-edge contemporary art.

Gamwell sees echoes of Mitchell’s dark stars, for instance, in Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, “A Descent Into the Maelstrom,” particularly the evocative 1919 illustration by Harry Clarke. “This seemed to have been an early analogy to a black hole for many people when the concept was first proposed,” said Gamwell. “It’s a mathematical construct at that point and it’s very difficult to imagine a mathematical construct. Poe actually envisioned a dark star [elsewhere in his writings].”

The featured art spans nearly every medium: charcoal sketches, pen-and-ink drawings, oil or acrylic paintings, murals, sculptures, traditional and digital photography, and immersive room-sized multimedia installations, such as a 2021-2022 piece called Gravitational Arena by Chinese artist Xu Bing. “Xu Bing does most of his work about language,” said Gamwell. For Gravitational Arena, “He takes a quote about language from Wittgenstein and translates it into his own script, the English alphabet written to resemble Chinese characters. Then he applies gravity to it and makes a singularity. [The installation] is several stories high and he covered the gallery floor with a mirror. So you walk upstairs and you see it’s like a wormhole, which he turns into an analogy for translation.”

“Anything in the vicinity of a black hole is violently torn apart owing to its extreme gravity—the strongest in the universe,” Gamwell writes about the enduring appeal of black holes as artistic inspiration. “We see this violence in the works of artists like Cai Guo-­ Qiang and Takashi Murakami, who have used black holes to symbolize the brutality unleashed by the atomic bomb. The inescapable pull of a black hole is also a ready metaphor for depression in the work of artists such as Moonassi. Thus, on the one hand, the black hole provides artists with a symbol to express the devastations and anxieties of the modern world. On the other hand, however, a black hole’s extreme gravity is the source of stupendous energy, and artists such as Yambe Tam invite viewers to embrace darkness as a path to transformation, awe, and wonder.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/in-the-90s-wing-commander-privateer-made-me-realize-what-kind-of-games-i-love/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since 1993, I think I’ve unconsciously judged almost every game by how well it can capture how Wing Commander: Privateer made me feel.

Steam and PlayStation (the two platforms I use the most) have been doing a year-in-review summary akin to the wildly popular Spotify Wrapped for the past few years. Based on these, I can report that my most-played games in 2025 were, from most hours down:

With the exceptions of Civilization VII and Unreal Tournament, every one of those games is some kind of open-world experience that’s all about immersing you in a far-flung land (or galaxy).

I like what I like, and my knowing that’s what I like began in the early 1990s with Wing Commander: Privateer.

Privateer taught me that I love games that are spaces for living out whatever fictional life I create for myself much more than I love games that are guiding me through an authored story and a series of carefully designed challenges.

Yes, it has a story and story missions, but they’re hardly the point, partly because they’re not really that good. What’s exciting about this game is exploring new systems, seeing the beautiful CG artwork for their settlements, learning about your ships’ capabilities and upgrading them slowly over time, and attaining mastery of the pseudo-simulated economy.

The story that matters in Privateer is the story I am telling myself in my head. To this day, the games I most love offer at least a taste of that experience.

To say this game was influential on later titles would be an understatement, but we, of course, have to acknowledge that this formula was originally popularized by 1984’s Elite. Privateer just married that formula with Wing Commander‘s universe and flight mechanics, with a far more hand-crafted setting. That setting is key, though. I like the original Elite, and this certainly wasn’t the case back in the mid-’80s, but today, it plays like a tech demo for what’s to come.

Privateer was the full package. Later, we got the X series, EVE Online, Elite Dangerous, Starfield, and even No Man’s Sky, a game I love so much I’m literally writing the book on it.

None of those games was made by Privateer lead Chris Roberts, of course. He would go on to work on Freelancer, probably the most accessible space trading/pirating game ever made, and an underappreciated gem, even if it didn’t live up to the hype that surrounded it. (Roberts left the project mid-way, and it was finished by others who dropped many of his impossibly ambitious ideas for it.)

Now we have Star Citizen. We here at Ars have covered that game as much as anybody, and it’s fair to say a lot of the coverage has not been positive. I won’t retread all that drama here; if you know, you know, and if you don’t, it’s easy to dig up.

But all that is to say that there are few space games today that aren’t directly inspired by Wing Commander: Privateer, and Privateer inspired me too: it inspired me to love sandbox and open-world games.

It’s odd that a game that was so heavily inspired by a title almost a decade its senior (Elite) still managed to be ahead of its time, and maybe that says as much for Elite as it does for Privateer

Privateer was re-released with Windows support via GOG in 2011, but it took me until recently to revisit it for the first time since the 1990s. Yes, it has ancient graphics now, but they’re endemic to a particular era of PC game graphics that I find extremely nostalgic, so they work for me.

In terms of mechanics and systems, everything Privateer does is done far better and to greater depths by at least one later space game. And to boot, it has more friction and frustrations, and while the game is ultimately pretty easy once you get the hang of it, it’s hard to learn.

But like Freelancer after it, it hits a sweet spot balancing all these aspects that makes it still stand out. Elite Dangerous is the best at the simulation and economy aspects, Star Citizen has more impressively realized ships and settlements, and No Man’s Sky is more accessible while still delivering on the fantasy (and it offers a much wider range of activities).

I don’t know if it’s just nostalgia for that aforementioned 1990s DOS game aesthetic speaking, though, but I’m of the opinion that none of Privateer‘s spiritual successors have matched the character and draw of its setting. Seeing this side of the Wing Commander universe is a treat, and I feel that even modern games that were entirely about having that same sense of culture and place (like Starfield, for example) don’t quite get there.

I’d be curious how it reads to people who never played it back in the day, though. Like I said, this is a pantheon game for me. If someone who plays Elite Dangerous, Starfield, Star Citizen, or No Man’s Sky today goes back and tries Wing Commander: Privateer out, does it hold up for them, too?

If that describes you and you give it a shot, let me know.

            <div id="article-text">When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out Civilization 7, Avowed, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Grand Theft Auto 6 as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year’s list of Ars’ favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the “expected” side of this year’s list.

But the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best Geometry Wars clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.

As we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed Grand Theft Auto VI chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.

When I was younger, I wanted—and expected—virtually every game I played to blow me away with something I’d not seen before. It was easier to hit that bar in the ’90s, when both the design and technology of games were moving at an incredible pace.

Now, as someone who still games in his 40s, I’m excited to see that when it happens, but I don’t expect it, Now, I increasingly appreciate games that act as a sort of comfort food, and I value some games as much for their familiarity as I do their originality.

That’s what Assassin’s Creed Shadows is all about (as I wrote when it first came out). It follows a well-trodden formula, but it’s a beautifully polished version of that formula. Its world is grand and escapist, its audio and graphics presentation is immersive, and it makes room for many different playstyles and skill levels.

If your idea of a good time is “be a badass, but don’t think too hard about it,” Shadows is one of the best Assassin’s Creed titles in the franchise’s long history. It doesn’t reinvent any wheels, but after nearly two decades of Assassin’s Creed, it doesn’t really need to; the new setting and story are enough to separate it, while the gameplay remains familiar.

No game this year has made me feel as hated as Avowed. As an envoy for the far-off Aedryan empire, your role in Avowed is basically to be hated, either overtly or subtly, by almost everyone you encounter in the wild, semi-colonized world of the Living Lands. The low-level hum of hatred and mistrust from the citizens permeates everything you do in the game, which is an unsettling feeling in a genre usually characterized by the moral certitude of heroes fighting world-ending evil.

Role-playing aside, Avowed is helpfully carried by its strong action-packed combat system, characterized as it is by thrilling moment-to-moment positional jockeying and the juggling of magic spells, ranged weapons, and powerful close-range melee attacks. The game’s quest system also does a good job of letting players balance this combat difficulty for themselves—if a goal is listed with three skull symbols on your menu, you’d best put it off until you’ve leveled up a little bit more.

I can take or leave the mystical mumbo-jumbo-filled subplot surrounding your status as a “godlike” being that can converse with spirits. Aside from that, though, I’ve never had so much fun being hated.

The term “walking simulator” often gets thrown around in some game criticism circles as a derisive term for a title that’s about nothing more than walking around and looking at stuff. While Baby Steps might technically fit into that “walking simulator” model, stereotyping it in that way does this incredibly inventive game a disservice.

It starts with the walking itself, which requires meticulous, rhythmic manipulation of both shoulder buttons and both analog sticks just to stay upright. Super Mario 64, this ain’t. But what starts as a struggle to take just a few short steps quickly becomes almost habitual, much like learning to walk in real life.

The game then starts throwing new challenges at your feet. Slippery surfaces. Narrow stairways with tiny footholds. Overhangs that block your ridiculously useless, floppy upper body. The game’s relentless mountain is designed such that a single missed step can ruin huge chunks of progress, in the proud tradition of Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.

This all might sound needlessly cruel and frustrating, but trust me, it’s worth sticking with to the end. That’s in part for the feeling of accomplishment when you do finally make it past that latest seemingly impossible wall, and partly to experience an absolutely gonzo story that deals directly and effectively with ideas of masculinity, perseverance, and society itself. You’ll never be so glad to take that final step.

The idea of bouncing a ball against a block is one of the most tried-and-true in all of gaming, from the basic version in the ancient Breakout to the number-filled angles of Holedown. But perhaps no game has made this basic concept as compulsively addictive as Ball x Pit.

Here, the brick-breaking genre is crossed with the almost as storied shoot-em-up, with the balls serving as your weapons and the blocks as enemies that march slowly but relentlessly from the top of the screen to the bottom. The key to destroying those blocks all in time is bouncing your growing arsenal of new balls at just the right angles to maximize their damage-dealing impact and catching them again so you can throw them once more that much faster.

Like so many roguelikes before it, Ball x Pit uses randomization as the core of its compulsive loop, letting you choose from a wide selection of new abilities and ball-based attacks as you slowly level up. But Ball x Pit goes further than most in letting you fuse and combine those balls into unique combinations that take dozens of runs to fully uncover and combine effectively.

Add in a deep system of semi-permanent upgrades (with its own intriguing “bounce balls around a city builder” mini game) and a deep range of more difficult settings and enemies to slowly unlock, and you have a game whose addictive pull will last much longer than you might expect from the simple premise.

Usually, when formulating a list like this, you can compare a title to an existing game or genre as a shorthand to explain what’s going on to newcomers. That’s nearly impossible with Blue Prince, a game that combines a lot of concepts to defy easy comparison to games that have come before it.

At its core, Blue Prince is about solving the mysteries of a house that you build while exploring it, drafting the next room from a selection of three options every time you open a new door. Your initial goal, if you can call it that, is to discover and access the mysterious “Room 46” that apparently exists somewhere on the 45-room grid. And while the houseplan you’re building resets with every in-game day, the knowledge you gain from exploring those rooms stays with you, letting you make incremental progress on a wide variety of puzzles and mysteries as you rebuild the mansion from scratch again and again.

What starts as a few simple and relatively straightforward puzzles quickly unfolds fractally into a complex constellation of conundrums, revealed slowly through scraps of paper, in-game books, inventory items, interactive machinery, and incidental background elements. Figuring out the more intricate mysteries of the mansion requires careful observation and, often, filling a real-life mad scientist’s notepad with detailed notes that look incomprehensible to an outsider. All the while, you have to manage each day’s limited resources and luck-of-the-draw room drafting to simply find the right rooms to make the requisite progress.

Getting to that storied Room 46 is enough to roll the credits on Blue Prince, and it serves as an engaging enough puzzle adventure in its own right. But that whole process could be considered a mere tutorial for a simply massive endgame, which is full of riddles that will perplex even the most experienced puzzlers while slowly building a surprisingly deep story of political intrigue and spycraft through some masterful environmental storytelling.

Some of those extreme late-game puzzles might be too arcane for their own good, honestly, and will send many players scrambling for a convenient guide or wiki for some hints. But even after playing for over 100 hours over two playthroughs, I’m pretty sure I’m still not done exploring all that Blue Prince has to offer.

This one will be controversial: I love Civilization VII.

Civilization VII launched as a bit of a mess. There were bugs and UI shortcomings aplenty. Most (but not all) of those have been addressed in the months since, but they’re not the main reason this is a tricky pick.

The studio behind the Civilization franchise, Firaxis, has long said it has a “33/33/33″ approach to sequels in the series, wherein 33 percent of the game should be familiar systems, 33 percent should be remixes or improvements of familiar systems, and 33 percent should be entirely new systems.

Critics of Civilization VII say Firaxis broke that 33/33/33 rule by overweighting the last 33 percent, mainly to chase innovations in the 4X genre by other games (like Humankind). I don’t disagree, but I also welcome it.

Credit is due to the team at Firaxis for ingeniously solving some longstanding design problems in the franchise, like using the new age transitions to curb snowballing and to expunge systems that become a lot less fun in the late game than they are in the beginning. Judged on its own terms, Civilization VII is a deep, addictive, and fun strategy game that I’ve spent more than 100 hours playing this year.

My favorite Civ game remains Civilization IV, but that game still runs fine on modern systems, is infinitely replayable out of the box, and enjoys robust modding support. I simply didn’t need more of the same from this particular franchise; to me, VII coexists with IV and others on my hard drive—very different flavors of the same idea.

I’m not sure I like what my minor CloverPit obsession says about me. When I fell into a deep Balatro hole last year, I could at least delude myself into thinking there was some level of skill in deciding which jokers to buy and sell, which cards to add or prune from my deck, and which cards to hold and discard. In the end, though, I was as beholden to the gods of random number generation as any other Balatro player.

Cloverpit makes the surrender to the vagaries of luck all the more apparent, replacing the video-poker-like systems of Balatro with a “dumb” slot machine whose handle you’re forced to pull over and over again. Sure, there are still decisions to make, mostly regarding which lucky charms you purchase from a vending machine on the other side of the room. And there is some skill involved in learning and exploiting lucky charm synergies to extract the highest expected value from those slot machine pulls.

Once you’ve figured out those basic strategies, though, CloverPit mostly devolves into a series of rerolls waiting for the right items to show up in the shop in the right order. Thankfully, the game hides plenty of arcane secrets beneath its charming PS1-style spooky-horror presentation, slowly revealing new items and abilities that hint that something deeper than just accumulating money might be the game’s true end goal.

It’s this creepy vibe and these slowly unfolding secrets that have compelled me to pour dozens of hours into what is, in the end, just a fancy slot machine simulator. God help me.

Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson; Windows, MacOS

Jenny is your average suburban Asian-American teenager, struggling to balance academic achievement, chores, an overbearing mother, romantic entanglements, and a healthy body image. What sounds like the premise for a cliché young adult novel actually serves to set up a compelling interactive narrative disguised as a mere mini-game collection.

Consume Me brilliantly integrates the conflicting demands placed on Jenny’s time and attention into the gameplay itself. Creating a balanced meal, for instance, becomes a literal test of balancing vaguely Tetris-shaped pieces of food on a tray, satisfying your hunger and caloric limits at the same time. Chores take up time but give you money you can spend on energy drinks that let you squeeze in more activities by staying up late (but can lead to debilitating headaches). A closet full of outfits becomes an array of power-ups to your time, energy, or focus.

It takes almost preternatural resource management skills and mini-game execution to satisfy all the expectations being placed on you, which is kind of the meta-narrative point. No matter how well you do, Jenny’s story develops in a way that serves as a touching semi-autobiographical look at the life of co-creator Jenny Jiao Hsia. That biography is made all the more sympathetic here for an interactive presentation that’s more engaging than any young adult novel could be.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach should not be fun. Much like its predecessor, the latest release from famed game designer Hideo Kojima is about delivering packages—at least on the surface. Yet the process of planning your routes, managing inventory, and exploring an unfathomably strange post-apocalyptic world remains a winning formula.

The game again follows Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus) on his quest to reconnect the world as humanity faces possible extinction. And yes, that means acting like a post-apocalyptic Amazon Prime. Standing in the way of an on-time delivery are violent raiders, dangerous terrain, and angry, disembodied spirits known as Beached Things.

It’s common to hear Death Stranding described as a walking simulator, and there is indeed a lot of walking, but the sequel introduces numerous quality-of-life improvements that make it more approachable. Death Stranding 2 has a robust fast-travel mechanic and better vehicles to save you from unnecessary marches, and the inventory management system is less clunky. That’s important in a game that asks you to traverse an entire continent to deliver cargo.

Beyond the core gameplay loop of stacking heavy boxes on your back, Death Stranding 2 has all the Kojima vibes you could want. There are plenty of quirky gameplay mechanics and long cutscenes that add depth to the characters and keep the story moving. The world of Death Stranding has been designed from the ground up around the designer’s flights of fancy, and it works—even the really weird stuff almost makes sense!

Along the way, Death Stranding 2 has a lot to say about grief, healing, and the value of human connection. The game’s most poignant cutscenes are made all the more memorable by an incredible soundtrack, and we cannot oversell the strength of the mocap performances.

It may take 100 hours or more to experience everything the game has to offer, but it’s well worth your time.

Since the days of Donkey Kong Country, I’ve always felt that Mario’s original ape antagonist wasn’t really up for anchoring a Mario-level platform franchise. Donkey Kong Bananza is the first game to really make me doubt that take.

Bonanza is a great showcase for the new, more powerful hardware on the Switch 2, with endlessly destructible environments that send some impressive-looking shiny shrapnel flying when they’re torn apart. It can’t be understated how cathartic it is to pound tunnels up, down, and through pretty much every floor, ceiling, and wall you see, mashing the world itself to suit your needs.

Bonanza also does a good job aping Super Mario Odyssey’s tendency to fill practically every square inch of space with collectible doodads and a wide variety of challenges. This is not a game where you need to spend a lot of time aimlessly wandering for the next thing to do—there’s pretty much always something interesting around the next corner until the extreme end game.

Sure, the camera angles and frame rate might suffer a bit during the more chaotic bits. But it’s hard to care when you’re having this much fun just punching your way through Bananza’s imaginative, colorful, and malleable world.

For a series that has always been about dodging, Doom: The Dark Ages is much more about standing your ground. The game’s key verbs involve raising your shield to block incoming attacks or, ideally, parrying them back in the direction they came.

It’s a real “zig instead of zag” moment for the storied Doom series, and it does take some getting used to. Overall, though, I had a great time mixing in turtle-style blocking with the habitual pattern of circling-strafing around huge groups of enemies in massive arenas and quickly switching between multiple weapons to deal with them as efficiently as possible. While I missed the focus on extreme verticality of the last two Doom games, I appreciate the new game’s more open-world design, which gives completionist players a good excuse to explore every square inch of these massive environments for extra challenges and hidden collectibles.

The only real problem with Doom: The Dark Ages comes when the game occasionally transitions to a slow-paced mech-style demon battle or awkward flying dragon section, sometimes for entire levels at a time. Those variations aside, I came away very satisfied with the minor change in focus for a storied shooter series.

Anyone who has read my book-length treatise on Minesweeper knows I’m a sucker for games that involve hidden threats within a grid of revealed numbers. But not all variations on this theme are created equal. Dragonsweeper stands out from the crowd by incorporating a simple but arcane world of RPG-style enemies and items into its logical puzzles.

Instead of simply counting the number of nearby mines, each number revealed on the Dragonsweeper grid reflects the total health of the surrounding enemies, both seen and unseen. Attacking those enemies means enduring predictable counterattacks that deplete your limited health bar, which you can grow through gradual leveling until you’re strong enough to kill the game’s titular dragon, taunting you from the center of the field.

Altogether, it adds an intriguing new layer to the logical deduction, forcing you to carefully manage your moves to maximize the impact of your attacks and the limited health-restoring items scattered throughout the field. And while finishing one run isn’t too much of a challenge, completing the game’s optional achievements and putting together a “perfect” game score is enough to keep puzzle lovers coming back for hours and hours of compelling logical deduction.

At first blush, Nightreign feels like a twisted perversion of everything that has made FromSoft’s Souls series so compelling for so many years. What was a slow-paced, deliberate open-world RPG has become a game about quickly sprinting across a quickly contracting map, leveling up as quickly as possible before taking on punishing bosses. A moody solitary experience has become one that practically requires a group of three players working together. It’s like an Elden Ring-themed amusement park that seems to miss the point of the original.

Let the purists belly ache about how it’s not really Elden Ring. They’re right, but they’re missing the point. Nightreign condenses the general vibe of the Elden Ring world into something very different but no less enjoyable. What’s more, it packs that vibe into a tight experience that can be easily squeezed into a 45-minute sprint rather than requiring dozens of hours of deep exploration.

That makes it the perfect excuse to get together with a few like-minded Elden Ring-loving friends, throw on a headset, and just tear through the Lands Between together for the better part of an evening. As Elden Ring theme parks go, you could do a lot worse.

Ghost of Yotei from Sucker Punch Productions starts as a revenge tale, featuring hard-as-nails Atsu on the hunt for the outlaws who murdered her family. While there is plenty of revenge to be had in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, the people Atsu meets and the stories they have to tell make this more than a two-dimensional quest for blood.

The game takes place on the northern Japanese island of Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido) several centuries after the developer’s last samurai game, Ghost of Tsushima. It has a lot in common with that title, but Ghost of Yotei was built for the PS5 and features a massive explorable world and stunning visuals. It’s easy to get sidetracked from your quest just exploring Ezo and tinkering with the game’s photo mode.

The land of Ezo avoids some of the missteps seen in other open-world games. While it’s expansive and rich with points of interest, exploring it is not tedious. There are no vacuous fetch quests or mindless collecting (or loading screens, for that matter). Even when you think you know what you’re going to find at a location, you may be surprised. The interesting side quests and random encounters compel you to keep exploring Ezo.

Ghost of Yotei’s combat is just as razor-sharp as its exploration. It features multiple weapon types, each with unlockable abilities and affinities that make them ideal for taking on certain foes. Brute force will only get you so far, though. You need quick reactions to parry enemy attacks and strike back—it’s challenging and rewarding but not frustrating.

It’s impossible to play Ghost of Yotei without becoming invested in the journey, and a big part of that is thanks to the phenomenal voice work of Erika Ishii as Atsu. Some of the game’s pivotal moments will haunt you, but luckily, the developer has just added a New Game+ mode so you can relive them all again.

There’s a moment in the second section of Hades 2 where you start to hear a haunting melody floating through the background. That music gets louder and louder until you reach the game’s second major boss, a trio of sirens that go through a full rock-opera showtune number as you dodge their bullet-hell attacks and look for openings to go in for the kill. That three-part musical presentation slowly dwindles to a solo as you finally dispatch the sirens one by one, restoring a surprisingly melancholy silence once more.

It’s this and other musical moments casually and effortlessly woven through Hades 2 that will stick with me the most. But the game stands on its own beyond the musicality, expanding the original game’s roguelike action with a compelling new spell system that lets you briefly capture or slow enemies in a binding circle. This small addition adds a new sense of depth to the moment-to-moment positional dance that was already so compelling in the original Hades.

Hades 2 also benefits greatly from the introduction of Melinoe, a compelling new protagonist who gets fleshed out through her relationship with the usual rogue’s gallery of gods and demigods. Come for her quest of self-discovery, stay for the moments of musical surprise.

A quickie sequel in the year or two after Hollow Knight’s out-of-nowhere success in 2017 might have been able to get away with just being a more-of-the-same glorified expansion pack. But after over eight years of overwhelming anticipation from fans, Silksong had to really be something special to live up to its promise.

Luckily, it is. Silksong is a beautiful expansion of the bug-scale underground universe created in the first game. Every new room is a work of painterly beauty, with multiple layers of detailed 2D art drawing you further into its intricate and convincing fallen world.

The sprawling map seems to extend forever in every direction, circling back around and in on itself with plenty of optional alleyways in which to get lost searching for rare power-ups. And while the game is a punishingly hard take on action platforming, there’s usually a way around the most difficult reflex tests for players willing to explore and think a bit outside the box.

Even players who hit a wall and never make it through the sprawling tunnels of Silksong’s labyrinthine underground will still find plenty of memorable moments in whatever portion of the game they do experience.

In a real-time-strategy genre that can often feel too bloated and complex for its own good, The King Is Watching is a streamlined breath of fresh air. Since the entire game takes place on a single screen, there’s no need to constantly pan and zoom your camera around a sprawling map. Instead, you can stay laser-focused on your 5×5 grid of production space and on which portion of it is actively productive under the king’s limited gaze at any particular moment.

Arranging tiles to maximize that production of basic resources and military units quickly becomes an all-consuming juggling act, requiring constant moment-to-moment decisions that can quickly cascade through a run. I’m also a big fan of the game’s self-selecting difficulty system, which asks you to choose how many enemies you think you can take in coming waves, doling out better rewards for players who are willing to push themselves to the limit of their current capabilities.

The bite-size serving of a single King Is Watching run ensures that even failure doesn’t feel too crushing. And success brings with it just enough in the way of semi-permanent ability expansions to encourage another run where you can reach even greater heights of production and protection.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance was a slog that I had to will myself to complete. It was sometimes a broken and janky game, but despite its warts, I saw the potential for something special. And that’s what its sequel, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, has delivered.

While it’s still a slow burn, the overall experience has been greatly refined, the initial challenge has been smoothed out, and I’ve rarely been more immersed in an RPG’s storytelling. There’s no filler, as every story beat and side quest offers a memorable tale that further paints the setting and characters of medieval Bohemia.

Unlike most RPGs, there’s no magic to be had, which is a big part of the game’s charm. As Henry of Skalitz, you are of meager social standing, and many characters you speak to will be quick to remind you of it. While Henry is a bit better off than his humble beginnings in the first game, you’re no demigod that can win a large battle single-handedly. In fact, you’ll probably lose fairly often in the early goings if more than one person is attacking you.

Almost every fight is a slow dance once you’re in a full suit of armor, and your patience and timing will be the key to winning over the stats of your equipment. But therein lies the beauty of KC:D II: Every battle you pick, whether physical or verbal, carries some weight to your experience and shapes Bohemia for better or worse.

After the incredible success of Mario Kart 8 and its various downloadable content packs on the Switch, Nintendo could have easily done a prettier “more of the same” sequel as the launch-window showcase for the Switch 2. Instead, the company took a huge gamble in trying to transform Mario Kart’s usual distinct tracks into a vast, interconnected open world.

This conceit works best in “Free Roam” mode, where you can explore the outskirts of the standard tracks and the wide open spaces in between for hundreds of mini-challenges that test your driving speed and precision. Add in dozens of collectible medallions and outfits hidden in hard-to-reach corners, and the mode serves as a great excuse to explore every nook and cranny of a surprisingly detailed and fleshed-out world map.

I was also a big fan of Knockout Mode, which slowly whittles a frankly overwhelming field of 24 initial racers to a single winner through a series of endurance rally race checkpoints. These help make up for a series of perplexing changes that hamper the tried-and-true Battle Mode formula and long straightaway sections that feel more than a little bit stifling in the standard Grand Prix mode. Still, Free Roam mode had me happily whiling away dozens of hours with my new Switch 2 this year.

For decades now, I’ve been looking for a twin-stick shooter that fully captures the compulsive thrill of the Geometry Wars franchise. Sektori, a late-breaking addition to this year’s top games list, is the first game I can say does so without qualification.

Like Geometry Wars, Sektori has you weaving through a field filled with simple shapes that quickly fill your personal space with ruthless efficiency. But Sektori advances that basic premise with an elegant “strike” system that lets you dash through encroaching enemies and away from danger with the tap of a shoulder button. Advanced players can get a free, instant strike refill by dashing into an upgrade token, and stringing those strikes together creates an excellent risk-vs-reward system of survival versus scoring.

Sektori also features an excellent Gradius-style upgrade system that forces you to decide on the fly whether to take basic power-ups or save up tokens for more powerful weaponry and/or protection further down the line. And just when the basic gameplay threatens to start feeling stale, the game throws in a wide variety of bosses and new modes that mix things up just enough to keep you twitching away.

Throw in an amazing soundtrack and polished presentation that makes even the most crowded screens instantly comprehensible, and you have a game I can see myself coming back to for years—until my reflexes are just too shot to keep up with the frenetic pace anymore.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tis the season when professional Santas are in peak demand, but many who choose this line of work often view it as a higher calling and maintain some aspects of the identity all year round—even those who don’t fit the stereotypical popular image of Santa, according to a paper published in the Academy of Management Journal.

Co-author Christina Hymer of the University of Tennessee got the idea for the study during the COVID pandemic, when she spent a lot of time watching Christmas movies with her toddler. One favorite was 2003’s Elf, starring Will Farrell as a full-sized human raised among elves who goes to New York City to find his biological father. The film prompted her to wonder about why someone would want to be Santa Claus and what their experiences in that role would be.

Hymer and her co-authors partnered with the leader of a “Santa school” to analyze archival surveys of 849 professional Santas, and conducted a new survey of another 382 Santas. They also did over 50 personal interviews with professional Santas. (One subject showed up in full costume for his zoom interview, with a North Pole background, and signed off with a merry “ho! ho! ho!”)

Hymer et al. found that professional Santas tend to fall into one of three categories. The first is a prototypical Santa: straight, portly white men with natural white beards. There are also semi-prototypical Santas who might fit the traditional physical characteristics in some respects but not others—they might be younger, or slimmer, or clean-shaven. Finally, there are non-prototypical Santas who are well outside the traditional depiction: people of color, women, disabled Santas, or LGBTQ+ Santas.

“There are pretty strong societal expectations around what Santa looks like, but we found that most anybody can be Santa if their heart desires it,” said co-author Borbala Csillag of Oregon State University. “When we looked at the people behind the suit, we found that the folks playing Santa are really more diverse than would be expected. The expectations for playing the role may seem exclusive, but they are surmountable. Think about your attributes in a comprehensive way so you can identify the dimensions of the role that are well-fitting. You will likely find attributes that map to that calling, even if they are not obvious at first.”

Frankly, what’s most interesting about the paper isn’t those three fundamental categories, but the personalized glimpses it gives of the people who choose to become professional Santas. While a few Santas might make six figures, most do not, and may even lose money being Santa—they do it anyway for the sheer love of it. Professional Santas usually don’t see the role as seasonal; many build their identities around it, whether they fit the stereotypical Kris Kringle image or not. “My feeling is, if you’re Santa all the time, you have to live as Santa and give up whoever you are,” said one subject. “I’m just striving to be a better person.”

They’ll wear red and green all year round, for instance, or maintain a full white beard.  One Santa trained himself to make “Ho, ho, ho!” his natural laugh. Another redecorated his house as “Santa’s house,” complete with Christmas trees and Santa figurines.

Sometimes it’s viewed as a role: a gay professional Santa, for instance, deliberately suppresses his sexual orientation when playing Santa, complete with partnering with a Mrs. Claus for public appearances. However, a female Santa who goes by Lynx (professional Santas typically take on pseudonyms) who is also a church leader, likens the job to a divine calling: “I can connect with people and remind them they’re loved,” she said. (She also binds her breasts when in costume because “Santa doesn’t have them double-Ds.”)

Perhaps that sense of a higher calling is why even non-prototypical Santas like Lynx persevere in the fact of occasional rejection. One Black Santa recalled being denied the position at a big box store once the interviewer found out his ethnicity, telling him the store didn’t hire Black or Hispanic Santas. “That hurt my heart so much,” he said. A disabled Santa who uses a scooter during parades recalled being criticized by other professional Santas for doing so—but stuck with it.

And while Bad Santa (2003) might be a fun holiday watch, actual “bad Santas” caught smoking, drinking, swearing, or otherwise behaving inappropriately are not popular figures within their community. “You’re never off,” one subject opined. “You lose a little bit of your identity because you can’t let your hair down and be yourself. You don’t know who’s watching you.”

“You’re Santa Claus 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year,” another Santa said. “If you act out, you risk shattering the magic.”

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/speed-act-passes-in-house-despite-changes-that-threaten-clean-power-projects/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The House of Representatives cleared the way for a massive overhaul of the federal environmental review process last Thursday, despite last-minute changes that led clean energy groups and moderate Democrats to pull their support.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.

The bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.

Critics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines, and wind and solar projects on federal land.

Speaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.

“What was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said.

After the bill’s passage through the House on Thursday, the SPEED Act’s Democratic cosponsor, Golden, praised the bill’s success.

“The simplest way to make energy, housing, and other essentials more affordable is to make it possible to actually produce enough of it at a reasonable cost,” Golden said in a press release following the vote. “The SPEED Act has united workers, businesses, and political forces who usually oppose each other because scarcity hurts everyone.”

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill aims to reform the NEPA process in several key ways. First, it makes changes to the ways agencies comply with NEPA—for example, by creating exemptions to when a NEPA review is required, and requiring agencies to only consider environmental impacts that are directly tied to the project at hand.

It would also drastically shorten the deadline to sue a federal agency over its permitting decision and constrain who is eligible to file suit. Current law provides a six-year statute of limitations on agency decisions for permitting energy infrastructure, and two years for transportation project permits. Under the SPEED Act’s provisions, those deadlines would be shortened to a mere 150 days and only allow lawsuits to be filed by plaintiffs who demonstrated in public comment periods that they would be directly and negatively impacted by the project.

NEPA does not require the government to make particular decisions about whether or how to move forward with a project based on a review’s findings. However, critics argue that in the decades since its passage, interest groups have “weaponized” the NEPA process to delay or even doom projects they oppose, sometimes forcing agencies to conduct additional analyses that add costly delays to project timelines.

Although climate activists and environmental groups have used NEPA to oppose fossil fuel projects, such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, oil and gas interests are far from the only group seeking respite. Some voices within the clean energy industry have called for permitting reform, too, arguing that delays stemming from the current permitting process have had a negative impact on America’s ability to build out more climate-friendly projects, including some offshore wind projects and transmission lines to connect renewables to the grid.

So when Westerman and Golden introduced the SPEED Act in the House, a hodgepodge of odd alliances and opposition groups formed in response.

The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, launched a seven-figure advertising campaign in recent months pushing lawmakers to pursue permitting reform, according to a report from Axios. And the bill also initially enjoyed support from voices within the clean power industry. However, last-minute changes to the bill—designed to win over Republican holdouts—undermined the SPEED Act’s cross-sector support.

The bill’s opponents had previously raised alarm bells that fossil fuel interests would disproportionately benefit from a more streamlined review process under the current administration, citing President Donald Trump’s ongoing war against wind and solar energy projects.

In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to pause, reconsider, or revoke already approved permits for renewable energy projects it dislikes. Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.

A bipartisan amendment to the SPEED Act, added during the Natural Resources Committee’s markup in November, sought to address some of those concerns by adding language that would make it more difficult for the administration to “revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere” with an existing authorization.

However, that measure encountered resistance from key Republican voices who support Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects.

On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in the Rules Committee were able to amend the SPEED Act in a way that would facilitate the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to axe renewable energy projects. The changes were spearheaded by Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), two vocal proponents of Trump’s energy policies. The amendment fundamentally undermined the technology-neutral aspirations of the bill—and any hope of receiving widespread support from moderate Democrats or the clean power industry.

According to Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, Harris and Van Drew’s amendment would allow the administration to exclude any project from the bill’s reforms that the Trump administration had flagged for reconsideration—something the administration has done repeatedly for renewable projects like offshore wind.

The result, Davis argued, is that the bill would speed up the environmental review process for the Trump administration’s preferred sources of energy—namely, oil and gas—while leaving clean energy projects languishing.

“They couldn’t pass the rule on Tuesday to even consider this bill without making it even better for the fossil fuel industry and even worse for the clean energy industry,” Davis said.

In a public statement following Thursday’s vote, Davis described the amended SPEED Act as “a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk to help big polluters.”

The American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable energy industry, previously hailed the bill as an important step forward for the future of clean energy development. But after the Rules Committee’s changes on Tuesday, the organization dropped its support.

“Our support for permitting reform has always rested on one principle: fixing a broken system for all energy resources,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a Wednesday statement. “The amendment adopted last night violate[s] that principle. Technology neutrality wasn’t just good policy—it was the political foundation that made reform achievable.”

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a nonprofit trade and advocacy organization, echoed that sentiment.

“Durable, bipartisan, technology-neutral permitting reforms that support and advance the full suite of American electricity resources and the necessary expansion of transmission infrastructure to get that electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed are essential to meeting that challenge reliably, securely, and most importantly, affordably,” said ACORE CEO Ray Long. “Unfortunately, the changes made on the House floor are a disappointing step backward from achieving these objectives.”

Following the SPEED Act’s passage through the House on Thursday, advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) issued a public statement praising the bill’s success while noting how the recent amendments had affected the law.

“While we are concerned that post committee additions to the bill could put the certainty of a range of projects at risk, this bill’s underlying reforms are critical to advancing American energy,” CRES President Heather Reams said in the statement.

Even before the move to strip protections for renewables from the bill, some critics—like Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—said that the legislation didn’t go far enough to curtail the president’s “all-out assault” against clean power, arguing that the bill does nothing to restore approvals that have already been canceled by the administration and doesn’t address other roadblocks that have been put in place.

“The administration cannot be trusted to act without specific language, in my view, to protect the clean energy projects already in the pipeline and to prevent the Interior Secretary from unilaterally stopping projects that are needed to lower costs and improve grid reliability,” Levin told Inside Climate News in an interview ahead of the House vote.

Both Levin and Davis pointed to a July memo from the Department of Interior that requires all wind and solar projects on federal land to receive higher-level approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“The administration is not even returning the phone calls of project developers. They are not responding to applications being submitted,” Davis said. “That sort of approach is in stark contrast with the ‘white glove, concierge service’—and that’s a quote from the Trump administration—the service they are providing for fossil fuel companies to access our public lands.”

The SPEED Act’s opponents also dispute the idea that NEPA reviews are one of the primary causes of permitting delays, arguing that reports from the Congressional Research Service and other groups have found little evidence to support those claims.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute, in a September interview with Inside Climate News.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said, like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Debate over NEPA and the reform of the permitting process will now move into the Senate, where experts say the SPEED Act will likely undergo further changes.

“I think as the bill goes forwards in the Senate, we’ll probably see a neutral, across-the-board approach to making sure the process is fair for all technology types,” Xan Fishman, an energy policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center told ICN after Thursday’s vote.

Fishman stressed it would be crucial to ensure permits for projects wouldn’t suddenly be cancelled for political reasons, but said he was optimistic about how the SPEED Act would be refined in the Senate.

“It’s great to see Congress so engaged with permitting reform,” he said. “Both sides of the aisle see a need to do better.”

This was a pretty good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Streaming platforms reigned supreme, with Netflix and Apple TV dominating our list with seven and five selections each. Genre-wise, we’ve got a bit of everything: period dramas (The Gilded Age, Outrageous), superheroes (Daredevil: Born Again), mysteries (Ludwig, Poker Face, Dept. Q), political thrillers (The Diplomats, Slow Horses), science fiction (Andor, Severance, Alien: Earth), broody fantasy (The Sandman), and even an unconventional nature documentary (Underdogs).

As always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2025.

Most of us have seen a nature documentary or two (or three) at some point in our lives, so it’s a familiar format: sweeping, majestic footage of impressively regal animals accompanied by reverently high-toned narration (preferably with a tony British accent). Underdogs takes a decidedly different approach. Narrated with hilarious irreverence by Ryan Reynolds, the five-part series highlights nature’s less cool and majestic creatures—the outcasts and benchwarmers more noteworthy for their “unconventional hygiene choices” and “unsavory courtship rituals.” (It’s rated PG-13 due to the odd bit of scatalogical humor and shots of Nature Sexy Time.)

Each of the five episodes is built around a specific genre. “Superheroes” highlights the surprising superpowers of the honey badger, pistol shrimp, and the invisible glass frog, among others, augmented with comic book graphics; “Sexy Beasts” focuses on bizarre mating habits and follows the format of a romantic advice column; “Terrible Parents” highlights nature’s worst practices, following the outline of a parenting guide; “Total Grossout” is exactly what it sounds like; and “The Unusual Suspects” is a heist tale, documenting the supposed efforts of a macaque to put together the ultimate team of masters of deception and disguise (an inside man, a decoy, a fall guy, etc.). Green Day even wrote and recorded a special theme song for the opening credits.

While Reynolds mostly followed the script (which his team helped write), there was also a fair amount of improvisation—not all of it PG-13. The producers couldn’t use the racier ad-libs. But some made it into the final episodes, like Reynolds describing an aye-aye as “if fear and panic had a baby and rolled it in dog hair.” We also meet the velvet worm, which creeps up on unsuspecting prey before squirting disgusting slime all over their food, and the pearl fish, which hides from predators in a sea cucumber’s butt, among other lowly yet fascinating critters. Verdict: Underdogs is positively addictive. It’s my favorite nature documentary ever.

Dep. Q is a rare show that commits to old tropes—an unlikable but smart central character revisits cold cases—and somehow manages to repackage them in a way that feels distinctive. To get a sense of the show, you only have to describe its precise genre. You might call it a murder mystery, and there are murders in it, but one of the mysteries is whether a key player is alive or not, given that a lot of her story takes place in flashbacks with an uncertain relationship to the present. It’s almost a police procedural, except that many of the police are only following procedures grudgingly and erratically. It’s not really a whodunnit, given that you only end up learning who done some of it by the time the first season wraps up. And so on.

Amid all the genre fluidity, the show does a great job of balancing the key challenge of a mystery program: telling you enough that you can make reasonably informed guesses on at least some of what’s going on without giving the whole game away and making it easy to figure out all the details. And the acting is superb. Matthew Goode does a nice job of handling the central character’s recent trauma while helping you understand why he has a few loyal co-workers despite the fact that he was probably unlikable even before he was traumatized. And Alexej Manvelov (who I’d never seen before) is fantastic as a former Syrian policeman who drops occasional hints that he had been an active participant in that country’s police state.

There are definitely quibbles. The creation of a cold case squad happens on the flimsiest of motivations, and the fantastic Kelly Macdonald is badly underused. But the show is definitely good enough that I’m curious about some additional mysteries: Can the team behind it continue to avoid getting bogged down in the tropes in season two, and which of the many threads it left unresolved will be picked up when they try?

          Marvel/Disney+

Enthusiasm was understandably high for Daredevil: Born Again, Marvel’s revival of the hugely popular series in the Netflix Defenders universe. Not only was Charlie Cox returning to the title role as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, but Vincent D’Onofrio was also coming back as his nemesis, crime lord Wilson Fisk/Kingpin. Their dynamic has always been electric, and that on-screen magic is as powerful as ever in Born Again, which quickly earned critical raves and a second season.

Granted, there were some rough spots. The entire season was overhauled during the 2023 Hollywood strikes, and at times it felt like two very different shows. A weird serial killer subplot was primarily just distracting. There was also the controversial decision to kill off a major character from the original Netflix series in the first episode. But that creative choice cleared the decks to place the focus squarely on Matt’s and Fisk’s parallel arcs, and the two central actors do not disappoint.

Matt decides to focus on his legal work while Fisk is elected mayor of New York City, intent on leaving his criminal life behind. But each struggles to remain in the light as the dark sides of their respective natures fight to be released. The result is an entertaining, character-driven series that feels very much a part of its predecessor while still having its own distinctive feel.

I confess I might have missed Boots had it not been singled out and dismissed as “woke garbage” by the Pentagon—thereby doubling the show’s viewership. I was pleased to discover that it’s actually a moving, often thought-provoking dramedy that humanizes all the young men from many different backgrounds who volunteer to serve their country in the US military. The show is based on a memoir (The Pink Marine) by Greg Cope White about his experiences as a gay teen in the military in the 1980s when gay and bisexual people weren’t allowed to serve. Boots is set in the early 1990s just before the onset of the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” era.

Miles Heizer stars as Cameron Cope (Cope White’s fictional alter ego), a closeted gay teen in Louisiana who signs up as a recruit for the US Marine Corps with his best (straight) friend Ray (Liam Oh). He’s not the most promising recruit, but over the course of eight episodes, we see him struggle, fail, pick himself back up, and try again during the grueling boot camp experience, forming strong bonds with his fellow recruits but all the while terrified of being outed and kicked out.

Heizer gives a powerful performance as Cameron, enhanced by the contrast with Max Parker’s stellar portrayal of the tightly wound Sergeant Liam Robert Sullivan—a decorated Marine inexplicably reassigned to train recruits while harboring his own secrets. Nor is Miles’ story the only focus: We learn more about several characters and their private struggles, and those inter-relationships are the heart and soul of the show. Netflix canceled the series, but this one season stands tall on its own.

This charming Emmy-nominated comedy series has made our “Best of TV” list every season, and 2025 is no exception. Only Murders in the Building (OMITB) stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as Charles, Oliver, and Mabel, all residents of the same Manhattan apartment complex, the Arconia. The unlikely trio teams up to launch their own true crime podcast whenever someone dies in the building under suspicious circumstances, chronicling their independent investigation to solve the murder. There’s no shortage of podcast fodder, as this single building has a shockingly high murder rate.

S5 focused on the death of the building’s doorman, Lester (Teddy Coluca), found floating in the Arcadia’s fountain in the season finale. The discovery of a severed finger leads our team to conclude that Lester was murdered. Their quest involves a trio of billionaires, the mayor (Keegan-Michael Key), a missing mafioso (Bobby Cannavale) and his widow (Tea Leoni), and maybe even the building’s new robotic assistant, LESTR (voiced by Paul Rudd). As always, the season finale sets up next season’s murder: that of rival podcaster Cinda Canning (Tina Fey), who lives just long enough to reach the Arcadia’s gates and place one hand into the courtyard—technically dying “in the building.” One assumes that OMITB will eventually run out of fresh takes on its clever concept, but it certainly hasn’t done so yet.

I unequivocally loved the first season of The Sandman, the Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s influential graphic novel series (of which I am a longtime fan). I thought it captured the surreal, dream-like feel and tone of its source material, striking a perfect balance between the anthology approach of the graphic novels and grounding the narrative by focusing on the arc of its central figure: Morpheus, lord of the Dreaming. It was a long wait for the second and final season, but S2 retains all those elements to bring Dream’s story to its inevitably tragic yet satisfying end.

As always, the casting is extraordinary and the performances are note-perfect across the board. And Netflix did not skimp on the visuals, which bring the graphic novel imagery to vivid life. I still appreciate how the leisurely pacing lets the viewer relax and sink into this richly layered fictional world. Part I kicked off with an Endless family reunion that led Dream into revisiting Hell and agreeing to his sister Delirium’s request to look for their absent brother, Destruction. That sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the tragedy that unfolds in Part II. The bonus episode, in which Death gets one day (every hundred years) to be human—an adaptation of the standalone Death: The High Cost of Living—serves as a lovely coda to this unique series, which is pretty much everything I could have wanted in an adaptation.

Ludwig is a clever twist on the British cozy mystery genre. David Mitchell stars as John Taylor, a reclusive eccentric who creates puzzles for a living under the pseudonym “Ludwig.” When his identical twin brother, Cambridge DCI James Taylor (also Mitchell), goes missing, his sister-in-law Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin) convinces John to go undercover. John reluctantly pretends to be James to gain access to the police department in hopes of finding out what happened to his twin. He inevitably gets drawn into working on cases—and turns out to be exceptionally good at applying his puzzle skills to solve murders, even as his anxiety grows about his subterfuge being discovered.

The best crime shows deftly balance cases-of-the-week with longer character-driven story arcs, and Ludwig achieves that balance beautifully. The writers brought in a puzzle consultant to create the various crosswords that appear in the series, as well as a special cryptic crossword done in character as Ludwig that appeared in The Guardian. The first season ended with a bit of a cliffhanger about what’s really been going on with James, but fortunately, the BBC has renewed Ludwig for a second season, so we’ll get to see more of our cryptic crime-solver.

Poker Face is perfect comfort TV, evolving the case-of-the-week format that made enduring early TV hits like Columbo and Murder, She Wrote iconic. The second season takes the endlessly likeable BS-detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) to the end of the road after she overcomes fleeing the mob in her 1969 Plymouth Barracuda. Along the way, Charlie pals around with A-list guest stars and solves crimes, winding her way from Florida to New York as each delightful new caper serves not to ramp up tension but to disrupt how viewers anticipate Charlie will move. Some might think that the lack of tension made the season weaker. But creator Rian Johnson recently revealed that he expects Poker Face to cast a new lead detective every two years. That makes it seem clear that Charlie’s second season was more about release.

In the most memorable episode of the season, “Sloppy Joseph,” the front row of an elementary school talent show suddenly becomes a bloody splash zone when a bullied boy is framed for killing the class pet, a gerbil, with a giant mallet. That scene is perhaps an apt metaphor for Johnson’s attempt to keep modern-day viewers from turning away from their TVs by shattering expectations. It’s unclear yet if his formulaic TV hijinks will work, but if anyone decides to pick up Poker Face after Peacock declined to renew it, Peter Dinklage is next in line to become the world’s greatest lie detector.

I was a latecomer to this eminently watchable show created by Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), who also gave us the Emmy-winning sensation Downton Abbey. Instead of following the adventures of post-Edwardian British aristocracy and their domestic servants, the focus is on ultra-wealthy Americans and their domestic servants in the 1880s and the social tensions that arise from the “old money” versus “new money” dynamic of this rapidly changing period. The Gilded Age has been described as an “operatic soap” (rather than a soap opera), replete with a hugely talented ensemble cast donning lavish costumes and cavorting in extravagantly opulent settings. It’s unadulterated, addictive escapism, and the series really hit its stride in S3.

Old Money is represented by Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski), a wealthy widow who lives with her spinster sister Ada (Cynthia Nixon); orphaned niece Marian (Louisa Jacobson); and son and heir Oscar (Blake Ritson), a closeted gay man seeking to marry a rich heiress. Living just across the street is New Money, personified by robber baron/railroad tycoon George Russell (Morgan Spector) and his socially ambitious wife Bertha (Carrie Coon) and their two children. You’ve got Marian’s friend Peggy (Denee Benton) representing the emerging Black upper class and a colorful assortment of domestics in both houses, like aspiring inventor Jack (Ben Ahlers), who dreams of greater things.

Fictionalized versions of notable historical people occasionally appear, and two figure prominently: Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy), who ruled New York society at the time, and her simpering sycophant Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane). (The Russells are loosely inspired by William and Ava Vanderbilt.) The stakes might sometimes seem small—there’s a multi-episode arc devoted to which of two competing opera houses New York’s social elite will choose to sponsor—but for the characters, they are huge, and Fellowes makes the audience feel equally invested in the outcomes. There were a few rough edges in the first season, but The Gilded Age quickly found its footing; it has gotten better and more richly textured with each successive season and never takes itself too seriously.

The Mitford sisters were born to be immortalized one day in a British period drama, and Outrageous is happy to oblige. There were six of them (and one brother), and their scandalous exploits frequently made global headlines in the 1930s. This is ultimately a fictionalized account of how the rise of Hitler and British fascism fractured this once tight-knit aristocratic family. The focus is on smaller, domestic drama—budding romances, failed marriages, literary aspirations, and dwindling fortunes—colored by the ominous global events unfolding on a larger scale.

Nancy (Bessie Carter) is the primary figure, an aspiring novelist with a cheating husband who feels increasingly alienated from her older sister and bestie Diana (Joanna Vanderham). Diana married a baron but becomes enamored of Oswald Mosley (Joshua Sasse), leader of the British fascist party, embarking on a torrid affair. Another sister, Unity (Shannon Watson), is also seduced by Nazi ideology and has a major crush on Hitler. Meanwhile, Jessica (Zoe Brough) is drawn to the Communist cause, which rankles both her siblings and her traditionally conservative parents.

Things come to a head when Unity goes to study in Germany and becomes completely radicalized, even publishing a vicious anti-semitic screed that shames the family. Diana also goes all-in on fascism when she leaves her husband for Mosley, whom Nancy loathes. Jessica elopes with her Communist cousin to Spain to be on the front lines of that civil war, leading to a lifelong estrangement from Diana. Nancy, the political moderate, is caught in the middle, torn between her love for her sisters and her increasing discomfort with Diana and Unity’s extreme political views.

The Mitford sisters were prolific letter writers all their lives, so there was plenty of material for screenwriter Sarah Williams to draw on when fictionalizing their stories at such a pivotal point in the family’s (and the world’s) history. Outrageous is quite historically accurate in broad outlines, and there are plenty of moments of wry, understated humor amid the family tensions. The gifted cast makes the sisters come alive in all their flawed humanity. There’s no word yet on a second season, and this one ends on a suitable note, but there’s so much more story left to tell, so I hope Outrageous returns.

I’ll admit I wasn’t sure how well A Man on the Inside would fare with its sophomore season after knocking it out of the park in S1. I should have known showrunner Mike Schur (The Good Place) could pull it off. Ted Danson plays Charles Nieuwendyk, a recently widowed retired engineering professor. In S1, he was hired by private detective Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) to go undercover at a San Francisco retirement community to solve the mystery of a stolen ruby necklace. In S2, Charles returns to his academic roots and goes undercover at fictional Wheeler College to solve the mystery of a stolen laptop—a crime that just might have implications for the survival of the college itself.

Charles even falls in love for the first time since his wife’s death with music professor Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen, Danson’s wife IRL), despite the two being polar opposites. The show continues to be a welcome mix of funny, sweet, sour, and touching, while never lapsing into schmaltz. The central Thanksgiving episode—where Mona meets Charles’s family and friends for the first time—is a prime example, as various tensions simmering below the surface erupt over the dinner table. Somehow, everyone manages to make their respective peace in entirely believable ways. It’s lovely to see a series grapple so openly, with so much warmth and humor, with the loneliness of aging and grief and how it can affect extended family. And the show once again drives home the message that new beginnings are always possible, even when one thinks one’s life is over.

When real-life political administrations refer to officials as Darth Vader in unironically flattering terms, maybe George Lucas made the Dark Lord of the Sith a little too iconic. Showrunner Tony Gilroy made no such effort in his depiction of the fascists in Andor.

During Andor‘s run, which ended this year with S2, the Empire is full of sad corporate ladder climbers who are willing to stab another in the back to get to the next rung of the Imperial hierarchy. The show makes it clear that these are not people to emulate. If more fans watched the show, maybe that message could have landed for them.

For people who grew up with Star Wars and want something more to chew on in our adulthood than endless callbacks to the original trilogy, Andor is revelatory. It colors the war of light versus dark with large amounts of gray because sometimes, as one character puts it, you have to use the tools of your enemy to defeat them (save for genetically gifted farmboys). Maybe most of Star Wars was always supposed to be for kids, but prestige TV viewers got a glimpse of what the universe could feel like if it took itself more seriously. Rather than use the broad strokes of a war of good versus evil, Andor painted between the lines to demonstrate how systemic oppression can look a lot more personal than firing a giant space laser.

For all its great writing and themes, Andor also delivered high stakes and suspense. Although we already knew the outcome of the story, we still held our breath during tense scenes with characters who make the ultimate sacrifice for a future they will never see.

My personal end-of-year TV list would never be complete without a nod to The Cowboy Channel, i.e., the only place where armchair enthusiasts like myself can follow our favorite cowboys and cowgirls throughout the rodeo season. The goal is to rack up enough money to qualify for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR), held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas every December. This year, I’ve picked the channel’s stellar annual coverage of the NFR itself to highlight. The entire season comes down to this: an intense 10-day competition in which the top 15 athletes in each event duke it out night after night in hopes of winning a coveted championship gold buckle. And night after night, The Cowboy Channel is there with live commentary and post-round analysis.

What I love most is just how unpredictable the NFR can be. Part of that is the substantial monetary rewards that come with round wins; an athlete coming in at #1 in earnings can see even a substantial lead evaporate over just a few nights. Part of it has to do with who wins the average, i.e., who performs the best over ten nights collectively in each event. Winning the average comes with a substantial payout that can lead to unexpected upsets in the final results. But mostly it’s just the human factor: The best in the world can have a bad night, and young rookies can have the night of their lives. An ill-timed injury can knock an athlete out of the competition entirely. And sometimes the judges make inexplicably bad calls with major consequences (*cough* Stetson Wright in Round 6 saddle bronc *cough*).

It’s all part of the excitement of rodeo. The Cowboy Channel’s in-depth coverage lets us experience all that drama even if we can’t attend in person and lets us savor how the story unfolds in each subsequent round. We celebrate the wins, mourn the losses, and cheer mightily for the final champions. (Stetson did just fine in the end.) Then we gear up to do it all over again next year.

The blockbuster success of the 1986 film Top Gun—chronicling the paths of young naval aviators as they go through the grueling US Navy’s Fighter Weapons School (aka the titular Top Gun)—spawned more than just a successful multimedia franchise. It has also been credited with inspiring future generations of fighter pilots. National Geographic took viewers behind the scenes to see the process play out for real with the documentary series Top Guns: The Next Generation.

Each episode focuses on a specific aspect of the training, following a handful of students from the Navy and Marines through the highs and lows of their training. That includes practicing dive bombs at breakneck speeds, successfully landing on an aircraft carrier by “catching the wire,” learning the most effective offensive and defensive maneuvers in dogfighting, and, finally, engaging in a freestyle dogfight against a seasoned instructor to complete the program and (hopefully) earn their golden wings. NatGeo was granted unprecedented access, even using in-cockpit cameras to capture the pulse-pounding action of being in the air, as well as more candidly intimate behind-the-scenes moments as the students grapple with their respective successes and failures. It’s a riveting watch.

My first draft of what was supposed to be a 300-ish word blurb describing why Alien: Earth is fantastic ended up exploding into a Defector-esque narrative deep dive into my ever-evolving relationship with Alien 3 as a film and how Alien: Earth has helped reshape my appreciation for that poor broken baby of a movie by mixing the best of its visual techniques into A:E’s absolutely masterful cocktail of narrative stylings—but I’ll spare you all of that.

Here’s the short version without the bloviating: Alien: Earth is the thing I’ve been waiting for since I walked out of the theater after seeing Alien 3 in the summer of 1992. Unlike Alien Resurrection, any of the AvPs, or the wet-fart, falls-apart-like-mud-in-the-third-act swing-and-miss of Alien: Romulus, A:E gets nearly everything right. It’s grounded without being stodgy; exciting without being stupid; referential without being derivative; fun without being pandering; respectful of the lore while being willing to try something new; and, above all else, it bleeds craftsmanship—every frame makes it obvious that this is a show made by people who love and care for the Alien universe.

The thing that grabs me anew with every episode is the show’s presentation and execution—a self-aware blending of all the best things Scott, Cameron, and Fincher brought to their respective films. As I get older, I’m drawn more and more to entertainment that shows me interesting things and does so in ontologically faithful ways—and oh, does this show ever deliver.

Each episode is a carefully crafted visual and tonal mix of all the previous Alien films, with the episodes’ soundtracks shifting eras to match the action on-screen—like Alien 3’s jumpy choir flash-cut opening credits melding into Aliens’ lonely snare drums. The result is a blended world made of all the best things I remember from the films, and it works in the same way the game Alien: Isolation worked: by conjuring up exactly what the places where we used to have nightmares looked and felt like, and then scaring us there again.

I have heard that The Internet had some problems with the show, but, eh, everybody’s going to hate something. I vaguely remember some of the complaints having to do with how some of the new alien life-forms seem to be scarier or deadlier than our beloved and familiar main monster. All I’ve got for that one is a big fat shrug—I’m fine with our capital-A-aliens sharing the stage with some equally nasty new creatures. The aliens are always more interesting as devices to explore a story than as dramatic ends themselves, and I mean, let’s face it, in the past 40-plus years, there’s not much we haven’t seen them do and/or kill. They’re a literary force, not characters, and I’m way more interested in seeing how they shape the story of the people around them.

The tl;dr is that Alien: Earth is awesome, and if you haven’t watched it, you absolutely should. And when I was a kid, I used to regularly get put in time-out in recess for stiff-arming other kids while pretending to be a power loader, so you should consider my tastemaking credentials in this matter unimpeachable.

In the most violent series to ever catch the world’s attention by playing beloved children’s games, it turns out that the most high-stakes choice that creator Hwang Dong-hyuk could make was to put a child in the arena. For Squid Game‘s final season, Hwang has said the season’s pivotal moment—a pregnant girl birthing a baby during a game of hide-and-seek with knives—was designed to dash viewers’ hopes that a brighter future may await those who survive the games. By leaving the task of saving the baby to the series hero, Seong Gi-hun, whose own strained relationship with his daughter led him into the games in the first season, Squid Game walked a gritty tightrope to the very end.

The only real misstep was involving the goofiest set of cartoon villain VIPs more directly in the games. But we can forgive Hwang the clunky Dr. Evil-like dialogue that slowed down the action. He’s made it clear that he put everything into developing dramatic sequences for the game players—losing teeth, barely eating, rarely sleeping—and he fully admitted to The New York Times that “I have a cartoonish way of giving comic relief.

Let’s be clear: The Diplomat is a soap opera. If you’re not into cliffhangers, intense levels of drama, and will-they-won’t-they sexual tension, it’s probably not going to be for you. Sometimes there’s so much going on that it becomes almost farcical. If that doesn’t scare you off, what do you get in return?

Superb actors given rich and intriguing characters to inhabit. A political drama that nicely finds a balance between the excessive idealism of The West Wing and the excessive cynicism of Veep. A disturbingly realistic-feeling series of crises that the characters sometimes direct, and sometimes hang on for dear life as they get dragged along by. And, well, the cliffhangers have been good enough to get me tuning in to the next season as soon as it appears on Netflix.

Kerri Russell plays the titular diplomat, who is assigned to what seems like a completely innocuous position: ambassador to one of the US’s closest allies, the UK. Rufus Sewell portrays her husband, a loose-to-the-point-of-unmoored cannon who ensures the posting is anything but innocuous. Ali Ahn and Ato Assandoh, neither of whom I was familiar with, are fantastic as embassy staff. And as the central crisis has grown in scale, some familiar West Wing faces (Allison Janey and Bradley Whitford) have joined the cast. Almost all of the small roles have been superbly acted as well. And for all the dysfunction, cynicism, and selfish behavior that drive the plot forward, the politics in The Diplomat feels like pleasant escapism when compared to the present reality.

Apple TV+’s Murderbot, based on Martha Wells’ bestselling series of novels The Murderbot Diaries, is a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery. Murderbot the TV series adapts the first book in the series, All Systems Red. A security unit that thinks of itself as Murderbot (Alexander Skarsgård) is on assignment on a distant planet, protecting a team of scientists who hail from a “freehold.”

Mensah (Noma Dumezweni) is the team leader. The team also includes Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski) and Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), who is an augmented human plugged into the same data feeds as Murderbot (processing at a much slower rate). Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) also serves as the team’s legal counsel; they are in a relationship with Arada (Tattiawna Jones), eventually becoming a throuple with Ratthi (Akshaye Khanna). Unbeknownst to the team, Murderbot has figured out how to override his governor module that compels it to obey the humans’ commands. So Murderbot essentially has free will.

The task of adapting Wells’ novellas for TV fell to sibling co-creators Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. (Wells herself was a consulting producer.) They’ve kept most of the storyline intact, fleshing out characters and punching up the humor a bit, even recreating campy scenes from Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. (John Cho and Clark Gregg make cameos as the stars of that fictional show-within-a-show.) The entire cast is terrific, but it’s Skarsgård’s hilariously deadpan performance that holds it all together as he learns how to relate to the humans—even forming some unexpectedly strong bonds.

Fans of Slow Horses (see below), rejoice: with Down Cemetery Road, Apple TV has blessed us with another exciting mystery thriller series based on the works of Mick Herron—in this case, his 2003 novel introducing private investigator Zoë Boehm (Emma Thompson). Ruth Wilson co-stars as Sarah, an artist rather unhappily married to a finance bro. A neighboring building is destroyed by an explosion, and Sarah tries to deliver a get-well card to a little girl who survived from her young classmates. She’s inexplicably rebuffed, and her dogged attempts to figure out what’s going on lead her to seek the help of Zoë’s PI partner and estranged husband Joe (Adam Godley). What Joe finds out gets him killed, setting Sarah and Zoë on a collision course with high-placed government officials trying to cover up a pending scandal.

Thompson and Wilson make a dynamic pair. This is Thompson’s meatiest role in a while: Her Zoë is all flinty cynicism and tough exterior, masking an inner vulnerability she’s learned to keep buried. Wilson’s Sarah is the polar opposite in many ways, but she’s equally dogged, and both women are eccentrics who tend to rub people the wrong way. They’re united in a common goal: find the missing girl and bring her kidnappers (and Joe’s killer) to justice. Down Cemetery Road takes a bit of time to set up its premise and its characters, but the pace builds and builds to a big, satisfying finale. It’s not quite on the level of Slow Horses, but it’s pretty darned close.

After watching five episodes of the nine-episode first season of Apple TV’s Pluribus, I’m still not sure if I should be rooting for protagonist Carol Sturka or not. On the one hand, Carol is one of the last true “individuals” on Earth, fighting to maintain that individuality against a creepy alien pseudo-virus that has made almost everyone else part of a creepy, psychically connected hive mind. Reversing that effect, and getting the world “back to normal,” is an understandable and sympathetic response on Carol’s part.

On the other hand, it’s unlear that being absorbed into the hive mind is a change for the worse, on a humanity-wide scale. Unlike Star Trek’s Borg—who are violent, shambling drones that seem to have an overall miserable existence—the new hive-mind humanity is unfailingly pacifist, intelligent, capable, and (seemingly) blissfully, peacefully happy. In a sense, this virus has “solved” human nature by removing the paranoia, fear, anger, and distrust that naturally come from never truly knowing what’s going on in your neighbor’s head.

The fact that Pluribus has so far been able to navigate this premise without coming down strongly on one side or the other is frankly incredible. The fact that it has done it with consistent humor, thrills, and amazing cinematography transforms it into a must-watch.

There are many things I enjoy about Slow Horses, the Apple TV thriller about some not-great spies based on Mick Herron’s novels of the same name. The plots are gripping. The acting can be sublime. It’s shot well. And in its fifth season, which began streaming this September, Slow Horses engages more with the author’s humor than in seasons past. But with a plot involving the honeypotting of the deluded computer expert almost-extraordinaire Roddy Ho (played to perfection by Christopher Chung), that would be hard to avoid.

Slough House is a rundown MI5 office used as a dumping ground for employees in disgrace—the slow horses. They can’t be fired, but they can quit, and working for Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) is meant to make that happen. Lamb is a veteran of the dirtiest days of the Cold War, knowing not only where most of the bodies are buried but having helped put a few of them there himself. His legendary field prowess is only dwarfed by his repellent personality, mocking and belittling everyone in sight—but often deservedly so.

Each member of his team is there for a different sin, and throughout the season—which involves a plot to destabilize the British government, ripped from an MI5 playbook—we see evidence of why they’ve been consigned to the slow horses. These are not invincible operators, just flawed human beings, perfectly capable of screwing up again and again. And yet, our lovable bunch of losers usually manages to come through in the end, showing up “the Park&quot;—MI5’s (fictional) head office in London’s Regent’s Park, which is usually a step behind Lamb’s quick and devious thinking.

The adaptation is faithful enough to the books to give me deja vu during the first episode, and with just six episodes in a season, the payoff comes relatively quickly. I can’t wait for season 6.

The second season of Severance was never going to be able to live up to the constant, slow rollout of gut punches that characterized the first season. Those first 10 episodes ably explored the most important implications of the titular severance procedure, which splits a single person into separate “innie” and “outtie” consciousnesses with distinct sets of memories. The audience got to explore those implications along with the “innie” characters, who were struggling against the boundaries of their odd cubicle life right up until that thrilling final shot.

With so much now revealed and understood, a lot of that fire fell out of the second season of the show. Sure, there were still some loose ends to tie up from the mysteries of the first season, and plenty of new, off-puttingly weird situations on offer. And the new season definitely has quite a few high points, like the big twist revealed when the “innies” get to have a rare outdoor excursion or the extended flashback showing a character trapped in a seemingly endless sequence of social tests she can’t remember afterward.

But S2 also spent entire episodes exploring backstories and mysteries that didn’t have nearly as much emotional or plot impact. By the time the final episode arrived—with a rescue sequence that required an inordinate amount of suspension of disbelief—I found myself wondering just how much more interesting juice there was to squeeze from the show’s brilliant original premise. I worry that the show is trending in the direction of Lost, which drew things out with a lot of uninteresting padding before finally resolving the plot’s core puzzle box in an unsatisfying way. I’m still along on that ride for now, but I really hope it’s going somewhere soon.

Paul William Davies created this delightful mystery comedy, loosely based on a bestselling nonfiction book by Kate Andersen Brower about the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others dedicated to ensuring the White House residence runs smoothly. In the middle of a state dinner for the visiting Australian prime minister, White House Chief Usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead in the third-floor game room. Everyone initially assumes it was suicide.

Enter private detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba), who most definitely does not think it was suicide and proceeds to investigate. She has about a dozen suspects, and her blunt, rather eccentric personality means she’s not remotely intimidated by the august setting of this particular murder. Cupp even takes the odd break in sleuthing to do a bit of birdwatching on the White House grounds. (It’s her goal to see all the birds President Teddy Roosevelt recorded during his tenure.) Birdwatching is more than a lifelong hobby for Cupp; it’s central to her character and to how she approaches solving crimes. Bonus: Viewers learn a lot of fascinating bird trivia over eight episodes.

Davies has devised a clever narrative structure, telling the story in flashbacks during a Congressional hearing (presided over by former US Sen. Al Franken playing a fictional senator from Washington state). It’s a good mystery with plenty of unexpected twists and snappy dialogue. Each episode title refers to a famous murder mystery; the camerawork is inventive and fun; and everyone in the cast knocks it out of the park. I especially loved pop star Kylie Minogue’s cameo playing a fictional version of herself as a state dinner guest. Davies apparently couldn’t convince her fellow Australian Hugh Jackman to also make a cameo. But Ben Prendergast’s winking portrayal of “Hugh Jackman&quot;—only seen from behind or with his face obscured—is actually funnier than having the real actor.

It would be a mistake to dismiss The Residence as a mere bauble of a murder mystery just because of its playful, lighthearted tone. The show really does capture what is special and unique about the people who keep the White House residence functioning and why they matter—to each other and to America. Cupp’s final speech after unmasking the killer drives home those points with particular poignancy.

Netflix sadly canceled this excellent series, so there won’t be a second season—although I’m not sure how the writers could improve on such a tour de force. Do we really need Cupp to solve another elaborate murder in the White House? If I’m being honest, probably not. But she’s such a great character. I’d love to see more of her, perhaps in a Knives Out-style franchise where the location and main suspects continually change while the central detective stays the same. Somebody make it so.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Just days after its robotaxi fleet crumbled into complete disarray because of a city power outage in San Francisco, the company was forced to suspend all rides again in the Bay Area on Thursday in anticipation of a nasty storm, CNBC reported.

Customers received word of the measure via the company’s ride-hailing app.

“Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning,” a notification read.

While you can hardly fault Waymo for erring on the side of caution, the measure comes as its self-driving cabs’ ability to handle conditions that fall outside its typical programming is being called into question.

The San Francisco incident, for instance, left its robotaxis stranded and helpless on public roads. Footage showed the cabs piling up at intersections, where they appeared confused about what to do without traffic lights to guide them. Rather than taking initiative or moving themselves out of the way, the cabs stayed idling in the middle of the roads, blocking motorists and even other Waymos. One video showed at least five of the cabs stuck in the same intersection. Frightened animals have a fight-or-flight response; Waymos have a stand-dumbfoundedly-in-place response.

Waymo has been offering fully autonomous rides to the public in San Francisco since 2024, with at least 800 robotaxis in the area. And though it boasts an impressive safety record, the cars have been a controversial presence with locals, whose complaints about the vehicles’ safety reached new heights last month when one of the cabs ran over and killed a beloved bodega cat.

Beyond tragedies like those, the cabs have been spotted more than occasionally driving down the wrong side of the road and committing blunders like getting stuck in a roundabout.

Other incidents like careening through an active police standoff and becoming paralyzed by a parade have exposed that the cars still struggle to handle the diversity of offbeat road scenarios one might be expected to encounter in a bustling city like San Francisco. Waymo can’t be blamed for the power outage last week, but that it seemingly didn’t equip its cars to handle a scenario like that is concerning.

“I think we need to be asking ‘what is a reasonable number of [autonomous vehicles] to have on city streets, by time of day, by geography and weather?&#39;” former CEO of San Francisco’s Municipal Transit Authority, Jeffrey Tumlin told CNBC.

            <div id="article-text">Who needs vicious music columnists when you live in the age of AI?

Apparently not Ashley MacIsaac, a Canadian fiddler, singer, and songwriter who was labeled a sex criminal by Google’s AI overview.

According to the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, event organizers at the Sipekne’katik First Nation, north of Halifax, canceled an upcoming performance featuring MacIsaac after Google incorrectly described him as a sex offender.

The paper reports that the misinformation was the result of one of Google’s AI summaries — brief summations it helpfully plasters above all other search results — which blended the musician’s biography with another person who bears the same name.

“Google screwed up, and it put me in a dangerous situation,” MacIsaac told the paper.

Though the AI overview has since been updated, MacIsaac explained that the situation presents a huge dilemma for him as a touring musician. For one thing, there’s no telling how many other event organizers passed on hiring him because of the libelous claim, or how many potential audience members got the wrong impression, but not the correction.

“People should be aware that they should check their online presence to see if someone else’s name comes in,” MacIsaac told the Globe.

After the truth came to light, the Sipekne’katik First Nation issued an apology, and extended a future welcome to the musician.

“We deeply regret the harm this error caused to your reputation, your livelihood, and your sense of personal safety,” a First Nation spokesperson wrote in a letter shared with the newspaper. “It is important to us to state clearly that this situation was the result of mistaken identity caused by an AI error, not a reflection of who you are.”

A representative for Google, meanwhile, said that “search, including AI Overviews is dynamic and frequently changing to show the most helpful information. When issues arise — like if our features misinterpret web content or miss some context — we use those examples to improve our systems, and may take action under our policies.”

Yet as MacIsaac correctly asserts, reputational risk is a difficult thing to repair. There’s no telling how far that misinformation might have spread — and when a corporation rolls out lazy software with obvious flaws, who’s responsible for the damage?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autopilot system took over a plane and pulled off an emergency landing completely autonomously.

The nail-biting intervention took place after the twin engine turboprop, a Beechcraft Super King Air, suddenly lost cabin pressure while flying across Colorado on December 20. Garmin’s Emergency Autoland system then took over, flew the plane, communicated with air traffic controllers, and made a fuss-free landing at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport near Denver.

“This was the first use of Autoland from start-to-finish in an actual emergency,” Garmin said in a statement, via CNN.

Various forms of autoland systems are routinely used to land aircraft in tough weather conditions where visibility is poor — but not during emergencies. Garmin’s system, however, is part of an emerging line of autoland systems intended for emergency use only, and is designed to take “complete control of the flight to land the airplane” in situations “where the pilot is unable to fly,” according to the manufacturer. That it managed to effortlessly handle a real-world emergency here is a milestone in aviation safety.

In this case, Garmin’s Autoland was automatically triggered because the “cabin altitude exceeded the prescribed safe levels” after the aircraft experienced “a rapid, uncommanded loss of pressurization,” Chris Townsley, CEO of the plane’s operator, Buffalo River Aviation, said in a statement. The pilots put on their oxygen masks, then “made the decision to leave the system engaged,” he added.

Once at the reins, the autonomous system selected where to land on its own, based on criteria like distance and runway length, and communicated its intent to ground control. “Emergency autolanding, 19 minutes from runway 30R at KBJC,” the system told the tower, as quoted by The Register.

The plane landed at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport around 2:20 pm local time. No passengers were on board the aircraft. Footage posted by emergency responders shows the two pilots disembark the plane on the runway.

In this case, the pilots made the voluntary decision to let Autoland take over and did not lose consciousness, contrary to initial speculation. (The system’s automated voice erroneously told air control that it had taken over after “pilot incapacitation,” leading to the confusion.)

“While the system performed exactly as expected, the pilots were prepared to resume manual control of the aircraft should the system have malfunctioned in any way,” Townsley said. The pilots “consciously elected to preserve and use all available tools and minimize additional variables in an unpredictable, emergent situation.”

The FAA said it was investigating the incident.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Thwaites Glacier, an enormous shelf of ice in the Antarctic, has been given the ominous nickname of the “Doomsday Glacier” — because if it were to change collapse, it could have profound implications for the future of sea level rise and the fate of coastal communities.

Scientists have watched in horror as its retreat has accelerated significantly. Now, as detailed in a study published by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) and spotted by Wired, large cracks forming in the ice shelf are continuing to weaken its structural integrity. Doomsday has never been closer.

If it were to collapse under its own weight, scientists suggest it could ultimately trigger up to 11 feet of global sea level rise, meaning certain devastation for tens of millions of people.

Now, a team of researchers from the University of Manitoba have analyzed satellite data from 2002 to 2022, and observed how cracks in the Thwaites Glacier continued to grow around a shear zone.

“Over the past two decades, the shelf has experienced progressive fracturing around a prominent shear zone upstream of its pinning point, gradually compromising its structural integrity,” the paper reads.

Over the two decades, satellite images showed the “total area length of fractures” growing from around 100 miles to over 200 miles, but the average length actually decreased, suggesting major new stresses acting on the glacier.

A similarly alarming situation is playing out below the water line as well. Another recent study observed how warming ocean waters are melting ice shelves like the Thwaites Glacier, changes that can be tracked not just over years, but mere hours and days as well as swirling eddies of water that can measure up to six miles across spin and burrow underneath these glaciers.

The international team of researchers also identified a worrying feedback loop: new cold water from the ice shelf mixes with warmer saltier ocean waters, causing ocean turbulence, which in turn, melts even more ice.

“This positive feedback loop could gain intensity in a warming climate,” coauthor and UC San Diego assistant professor Lia Siegelman told CNN.

Scientists are still racing to fully understand the devastating effects of global warming on the Doomsday Glacier. One thing’s for sure: the prognosis isn’t great. According to the ITGC’s 2025 report, the glacier’s retreat has “accelerated considerably over the past 40 years.”

“Although a full collapse is unlikely to occur in the next few decades, our findings indicate it is set to retreat further, and faster, through the 21st and 22nd centuries,” the report reads.

“Immediate and sustained climate change mitigation (decarbonisation) offers the best hope of delaying this ice loss and avoiding initiation of similar unstable retreat in marine-based sectors of East Antarctica,” the group wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The backlash against AI invading almost every aspect of the computing experience is growing by the day.

Particularly as an onslaught of lazy AI slop subsuming news feeds, the tech is starting to feel like a massive distraction — and huge parts of the internet are disillusioned or even fuming in anger.

For instance, a vast number of Windows users refused to upgrade after Microsoft announced it would turn the operating system into a so-called “agentic OS.”

Even household names in the open-source industry aren’t safe. After being appointed as the new CEO of open-source software company Mozilla, whose Firefox browser has long been lauded as a compelling alternative to Google’s Chrome and Apple’s Safari, Anthony Enzor-DeMeo announced that it would be tripling down on AI.

In a December 16 blog post, Enzor-DeMeo announced that Firefox would become a “modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.”

But a ringing backlash quickly forced the company into damage control mode.

“I’ve never seen a company so astoundingly out of touch with the people who want to use its software,” one disillusioned user tweeted in response to the news.

“I switched back to Firefox late last year BECAUSE it was the last AI-free browser,” another lamented. “I shoulda known.”

“Please don’t turn Firefox into an AI browser,” yet another begged. “That’s a great way to push us to alternatives.”

The outcry was formidable enough for Mozilla to clarify the company’s new CEO’s comments.

“Something that hasn’t been made clear: Firefox will have an option to completely disable all AI features,” the company wrote in an update on Mastodon. “We’ve been calling it the AI kill switch internally. I’m sure it’ll ship with a less murderous name, but that’s how seriously and absolutely we’re taking this.”

An open letter posted to the Firefox subreddit took issue with Enzor-DeMeo’s new direction.

“Ironically, in a post announcing this new direction and highlighting ‘agency and choice,’ there was little mention of user input or feedback,” the letter reads. “This highlights a disconnect that many of us experience daily: Mozilla has a pattern of struggling to implement and support basic features, and much of the time fails to even acknowledge serious user feedback.”

“Firefox doesn’t need to become Google or Microsoft to succeed by both business and user standards,” the letter goes on. “It’s beloved precisely because it’s not. I hope that distinction isn’t lost as Mozilla enters its ‘next chapter’ as part of a ‘broader ecosystem of trusted software.&#39;”

In an apparent effort to reassure the company’s most diehard fans, Enzor-DeMeo took to the comments.

“Rest assured, Firefox will always remain a browser built around user control,” he wrote. “That includes AI. You will have a clear way to turn AI features off. A real kill switch is coming in Q1 of 2026.”

However, his attempts to calm the situation ended up fanning the flames even further.

“If a ‘kill switch’ is the official control for this, then the entire organization needs to stop referring to your ‘AI’ features as ‘opt-in,&#39;” one user responded. “This is clearly opt-out.”

“If Mozilla can’t agree to that basic definition, I don’t see how users are supposed to trust it’ll actually work,” the user added.

Interestingly, the competing browser company Vivaldi, whose browser is based on Google’s open-source Chromium project, has taken a dramatically different approach.

In an August blog post, Vivaldi CEO Jon von Tetzchner accused other companies like Google and Microsoft of “reshaping the address bar into an assistant prompt, turning the joy of exploring into inactive spectatorship.”

“We will continue building a browser for curious minds, power users, researchers, and anyone who values autonomy,” von Tetzchner wrote.

“If AI contributes to that goal without stealing intellectual property, compromising privacy or the open web, we will use it,” he added. “If it turns people into passive consumers, we will not.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The International Space Station was painstakingly assembled segment by segment, launched into orbit by many expensive and logistically complex rockets.

Now there’s intense interest in a radically different model: launching space habitats that can inflate like balloons once they’re in space, creating far more room for astronauts inside — and maximizing the amount of orbital real estate they can claim with just a single launch.

Case in point, the aptly-named startup Max Space recently unveiled plans for its private space habitat, dubbed Thunderbird Station, that can expand to a whopping 12,300 cubic feet — roughly a third of the volume of the ISS — while only requiring a single launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

Max Space is tentatively planning to launch the massive inflatable by 2029, giving future space travelers “unprecedented volume usable in all dimensions, per the firm’s website.

While it remains to be seen whether the company will ultimately be successful in its ambitious endeavor — it’s only one of several companies working on inflatable space habitats — it’s an exciting vision for a far roomier and potentially luxurious future in our planet’s orbit.

It’s especially pertinent because the retirement of the ISS is a mere five years away, which could leave NASA without the ability to conduct scientific experiments in space. The agency has since called on the private industry to come up with a successor.

The Thunderbird Station concept features large, domed windows allowing astronauts to take in epic views while “huge screens for live Earth and space views” double for “entertainment and communications.”

Individual pods give astronauts privacy as well. The layout of the interior is also reconfigurable, allowing astronauts to “adapt and create working and living areas inside the space station that are fit for purpose — even during a mission,” per the firm.

After NASA announced a revision to its existing Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations (CLD) program in August, Max Space decided to throw its hat into the ring.

“It was pretty clear that was an opportunity for us to put a proposal forward to show how these modules can really be used for human habitation,” Max Space CEO Saleem Miyan told SpaceNews. “That CLD proposal gave us an incentive to strategically look at how we would bring forward the roadmap, and so that’s exactly what we’ve done.”

But going from concept to reality will be anything but easy. Max Space is hoping to launch a scaled-down prototype no sooner than early 2027 in a SpaceX rideshare mission.

A key test will be whether the module can withstand impacts from micrometeoroids and space debris, an important quality for anything orbiting an increasingly cluttered space. Just this month, China sent two astronauts outside its space station to install debris protection panels after one of its docked spacecraft sustained damage.

Despite plenty of engineering challenges to still overcome, Miyan is already eying even more ambitious targets, arguing that the habitat could be modified for lunar and Mars missions as well.

“We see so many interesting applications where habitats, whether human-rated or not, are required,” he told SpaceNews. “Those are the areas where I think we’re going to stand out.”

            <h2>Sauron, the high-end home security startup for “super premium” customers, plucks a new CEO out of Sonos</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/28/from-sonos-to-sauron-new-ceo-takes-on-high-end-home-security-startup-still-in-development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Kevin Hartz’s security system failed to alert him as an intruder rang his doorbell and tried to enter his San Francisco home late one night, the serial entrepreneur decided existing solutions weren’t good enough. His co-founder Jack Abraham had experienced similar frustrations at his Miami Beach residence.

In 2024, they launched Sauron — named after the sinister, all-seeing eye from “The Lord of the Rings” — to build what they envisioned as a military-grade home security system for tech elites. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year.

The startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir, defense tech investors including 8VC, Abraham’s startup lab Atomic, and Hartz’s investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel.

But a year later, Sauron is still very much in development mode —  a reality that its new CEO, Maxime “Max” Bouvat-Merlin, acknowledged candidly in a recent interview with TechCrunch.

After nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. He’s spending his first days on the job finalizing fundamental questions: which sensors to use, how exactly the deterrence system will work, and when the company can realistically get products into customers’ homes.

The answer to that last question? Later in 2026 at the earliest — a significant delay from the original timeline.

“We’re in the development phase,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “You’ll see a phased approach where we get our solution to market as a stepping stone. All the different components — our concierge service, our AI software running on servers, our smart cameras — are building blocks coming together in a plan we just put in place very recently.”

Still, Bouvat-Merlin sees striking parallels between Sauron and Sonos, which both target wealthy customers first, rely on word-of-mouth growth, and combine complex hardware with sophisticated software. “I had lunch with John MacFarlane, the founder of Sonos, a few weeks ago,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “All the topics he was thinking about when starting Sonos were exactly the same topics we’re discussing at Sauron.”

Both companies faced the same strategic questions: Start with super-premium customers or mass premium? Professional installation or DIY? Build everything in-house or partner with an ecosystem? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said.

Bouvat-Merlin says he was drawn to Sauron by both the mission and an opportunity to solve a real customer problem. “Securing people’s homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people’s minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said.

His research showed that market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don’t respond because they assume it’s a false alarm.”

The company is targeting customers “where safety and security is a major concern”  —  people like Hartz. The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.”

So what exactly is Sauron building? The answer is still evolving. The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors —  “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel.

“Those people understand patterns,” he said. “They’re good at helping us mature our machine learning solution and train our system to detect weird behaviors.”

The deterrence system remains somewhat vague. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage.

“The more upfront we are with deterrence, the more we can convince people this is the wrong house to rob and the wrong decision to make,” he said.

As for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. “These are roadmap conversations. I don’t want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we’re such a small company,” he said. He added that, bigger picture, the focus is on growing the ecosystem through partnerships rather than reinventing the wheel.

With fewer than 40 employees, Sauron plans to hire just 10 to 12 more in 2026. The company will also begin working with early adopters later in 2026, with a Series A fundraise planned for mid-year.

“Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it’s because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “I want to make sure we’re showing progress and explaining how we’ll use extra funds to accelerate growth, [including to] launch our first end-to-end product, drive customer adoption, and accelerate the roadmap.”

The company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron’s three founders, which include roboticist and engineer Vasumathi Raman. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.”

But Bouvat-Merlin is cautious about growth. “I want to make sure we grow sustainably and keep the experience and service premium over time,” he said. “I want to manage growing pains as much as possible while driving profitability.”

The surveillance state questionFacial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. “I granted you access to my house, so now you’re in the trusted group. When you come, I detect it’s you and you’re allowed in. Everyone else is an unknown person,” he said, painting a picture of a likely scenario.

License plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. “How do we assess if that’s a threat? The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said.

Either way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead because of Sauron’s approach. “A lot of companies started as traditional security companies and are trying to add tech,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’re looking at it from the opposite angle — we’re a tech startup in San Francisco bringing technology to this market.”

Sauron is also appearing on the scene as concerns rise about crime among the most wealthy. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco’s Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats.

“We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’ve seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. I don’t think the world is getting safer — there are probably more disparities between people at the top and bottom of the wealth spectrum. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”Still, much remains uncertain about Sauron’s path. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.)

It must also determine how to serve customers in different settings,  from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality.

For now, Bouvat-Merlin says he’s focused on listening to his team, building credibility, and finalizing the strategy he’s putting in place. “I don’t demand that people trust me  — I want to show them why they should.”

The company expects to share more details about its products later next year.

            <div id="article-text">Local police said they have charged an Illinois driver who struck and killed a pedestrian while she was livestreaming on TikTok.

The New York Times reports that Tynesha McCarty-Wroten, who posts to TikTok under the name Tea Tyme, has been charged by the Zion Police Department with two felonies —  reckless homicide and aggravated use of a communications device resulting in death.

In a video that has been reshared by other accounts on TikTok, a woman posting as Tea Tyme can reportedly be seen speaking into her phone when there’s a loud thud. An offscreen child asks, “What was that?” then the woman replies, “I hit somebody.”

Surveillance videos reportedly showed McCarty-Wroten’s vehicle entering the intersection while the traffic light was still red, with investigators determining that she did not seem to slow down or change course before striking Darren Lucas, who was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

McCarty-Wroten’s lawyer told the NYT that evidence will show that “what happened was an accident, was a negligent act, but was not an intentional or reckless act.”

            <div id="article-text">Good news for anyone tired of or embarrassed by their current Gmail address: You may soon be able to change it without losing access to your old emails and files.

As first spotted by the Google Pixel Hub group on Telegram and subsequently reported in 9to5Google, a Hindi version of the Gmail support website states that Google is “gradually rolling out to all users” the ability to change the email address tied to their Google account, including changing from their current Gmail address to “to a new email address that ends in gmail.com.”

If you make the switch, your old Gmail address should still work as an alias, and you’ll be able to sign into Google services with either your new or old address. However, you won’t be able to create any additional Gmail addresses tied to your account for another 12 months.

As of Sunday afternoon, the English-language version of the support site still states, “If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it” and instead suggests changing the name associated with the address or signing up for a new address and then transferring emails and contacts over.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This year, Apple released three new Apple Watch models: the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3, and Apple Watch Ultra 3. If you received an Apple gift card over the holidays and are exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.

With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.

Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice.

While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more.

Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller.

Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need.

We’ll walk you through the similarities and differences between the two smart watches to help inform your decision.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the founders of WeTransfer — a popular free file-sharing service used by millions worldwide — is publicly criticizing the company’s new direction. Dutch entrepreneur Nalden, who co-founded the platform in 2009, says he’s deeply unhappy with changes made since Bending Spoons — a Milan-based tech firm known for buying and restructuring popular apps — acquired the service last year.

“Bending Spoons doesn’t really care about people. Even though I get that it is their private equity strategy, I notice that since I left [WeTransfer] in 2019, there were a lot of updates that were basically killing the product, in my point of view,” he told TechCrunch.

After the acquisition, WeTransfer made unclear changes to how transfer links work and laid off 75% of its staff. This year, the company sparked controversy over employing its users’ content to train AI models and had to backtrack on changes to its terms.

Soon after, Nalden says creatives began reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer that recaptured the original ethos of the service around simplicity. That service is called Boomerang, and users can transfer files without logging in.

“Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I’ve always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that [is entirely focused on the] user experience, its ease of use. It’s the simplicity of sharing something quickly and that just saves time. You don’t need to sign up, you don’t need to verify via email,” Nalden told TechCrunch of the service.

For casual users, the non-login experience should be sufficient, though it has its limits. 1GB of total storage, and a 1GB file size limit with a seven-day expiration. Creating a free account bumps that to 3GB of total storage and a 3GB file size limit. You’ll also get the upload history, the ability to add and delete files anytime, and custom emojis for file-sharing pages.

If you want even more, a €6.99 per-month tier offers 200GB per folder and 500GB total storage with a 5GB file size limit, plus custom covers for folders, password protection, file expiration up to 90 days, and unlimited user invites per folder.

Nalden says he won’t offer advertising or collect unnecessary user data. He feels advertising adds complexity, and with Boomerang, he wants to collect as little information as possible.

“I just want to offer a tool that works for users. It’s like buying a hammer. You possibly don’t want to buy a fancy hammer, but a hammer that just works,” he noted.

Boomerang’s interface is intentionally barebones, which Nalden says is a refreshing change from design meant to impress investors. While many companies add more and more AI features, Nalden said he’s using AI to build the product but won’t add AI to user-facing features.

Boomerang is available on the web, with a dedicated Mac app coming soon.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/28/mayimflow-wants-to-stop-data-center-leaks-before-they-happen/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The mania around data centers has a lot of companies looking to become “picks and shovels” providers, by building profitable businesses that are ancillary to the gold rush gigs of selling server access or training leading AI models.

MayimFlow, the Built World stage winner at this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt, is a good example. The startup is focused on essentially one task: preventing damaging water leaks.

Data centers use a lot of water, and that water can present a big risk, even if a leak is small. Founder John Khazraee told TechCrunch that many data centers only have reactive solutions for water leaks. That can saddle companies with downtime and set them back millions of dollars if one occurs.

Khazraee would know. He spent more than 15 years building infrastructure for IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. With MayimFlow, he’s developed a combination of IoT sensors and edge-deployed machine learning models that can detect signs of impending leaks.

“I’ve noticed these issues in data centers, and the only solution they had was: ‘when the leak happens, we find out,’” he said in an interview. “Now you have to spend a lot of money to go remediate the situation. Now you got to turn off the servers. Now the data is being disrupted. So I decided to do something about it.”

Khazraee assembled a small team with plenty of experience to take on this challenge. Jim Wong, MayimFlow’s chief strategy officer, has spent decades working with data centers. Chief technology officer Ray Lok has carved out a career in water management and IoT infrastructure.

Beyond the scariest consequences of unnoticed water leaks, there’s an element of frugality to what Khazraee is trying to do with MayimFlow, which he said comes from his childhood.

“I grew up in a very, you know, I don’t want to say the word ‘poor’ family, but we weren’t the most well-off family,” he said. “And my dad would always, when I was taking a shower, tell me, ‘Hey, you’re in the shower too long. Are you singing in there?’”

As he grew up, Khazraee said he found himself always thinking about how to make things more efficient — especially as he studied to become an engineer. In college, he worked at a facility that collected frying oil from restaurants and converted it to biodiesel. It was a “messy job,” he said, but he liked the end result.

Khazraee is now trying to mix this penchant for frugality with the experience of his team. He believes they can give data center operators 24 to 48 hours of advanced warning that repairs will be needed.

MayimFlow has collected a glut of sample data from various industrial water systems that allow them to make these kinds of predictions, he said. The company can provide sensors that can help monitor a water system or plug its machine learning models into existing ones if companies already have similar hardware.

Khazraee said he wants to bring this solution beyond data centers to commercial buildings, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and possibly even utilities. In his eyes, any company that wants to spot leaks early, or optimize water usage, could be a customer.

Khazraee thinks it’s such a big opportunity he’s turned down roles at multiple big tech companies while building MayimFlow over the last two years.

“I really believe in the vision. I believe in the impact that we’re making,” he said. “Water is becoming one of those big issues in our world.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you went to the movies this fall, you probably met him: the Sad Art Dad. You’ll have known him by his miserableness; despite the flash of the cameras and the cheers of the groundlings, he’s most often found moping alone. His vocation may vary—movie star (in Jay Kelly), art-house director (Sentimental Value), blockbuster Tudor playwright (Hamnet)—but his problem tends to be the same. He has chosen great art over good parenting, utterly failing as a father, and he knows it. There’s something delicious about his cocktail of self-pity and self-loathing, which can arouse both the viewer’s repulsion and compassion. It may not be much fun to be a Sad Art Dad, but it’s certainly fun to watch one.

The distant and distracted patriarch, although abundant on-screen in 2025, is not a novel invention. Yet most movie dads are more likely to be found balancing stellar careers and model parenting (lawyer-dad in To Kill A Mockingbird; Mob-dad in the Godfather films) than exhibiting—let alone acknowledging—their fatherly flaws. Sometimes prioritizing professional ambitions is even depicted as admirable: In Interstellar, Matthew McConaughey plays an astronaut who abandons his kids for a decades-long space mission, but only in order to save humanity. The character might beat himself up for it, but the viewer understands that it’s a pretty good excuse, as far as they go.

What’s different about this new cinematic crop of dads is their culpability. They each choose themselves over their kids, prioritizing creative fulfillment. George Clooney’s titular A-lister in Noah Baumbach’s Jay Kelly admits as much when trying to explain his years-long absence to his now-adult daughter: “I wanted something very badly,” he says, “and I thought if I took my eye off of it, I couldn’t have it.” At least Jay is trying to apologize. When Gustav (played by Stellan Skarsgård), the ornery patriarch of Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value, is accused by his daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve) of never having watched her perform, he defends himself by saying that he doesn’t like theater. Meanwhile, in Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet, William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) likes the theater a bit too much. Although he’s a much more affectionate parent than Jay or Gustav, the Bard’s absence—he gallops away from plaguey Stratford-upon-Avon to the Elizabethan West End—has calamitous consequences for his kids.

Read: Parenting is the least of her worries

But these films are not pat condemnations of the flawed fathers they depict; they illustrate, sometimes with seeming ambivalence, the consequences of such self-absorption. Tellingly, Sentimental Value’s most tender scene doesn’t feature Gustav at all. Instead, it’s a quiet moment between Nora and her sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Having finally read Gustav’s latest screenplay, and found within it surprising echoes of the darkest periods of her own life, an emotional Nora sits on her bedroom floor beside her sister. The script is so uncannily accurate, Agnes notes, that it’s as though their father had been there for Nora’s suffering. “Well, he wasn’t,” Nora replies. “You were.”

It’s a gorgeous demonstration of familial love that also lays bare the true cost of the Sad Art Dad’s narcissism. He has made himself redundant; his children have learned, painfully, to cope without him. The same specter of redundancy haunts both Hamnet and Jay Kelly. When Shakespeare arrives home after tragedy strikes, he finds that he’s too late to help his family. He then announces his intent to return to London—and his wife, Agnes (Jessie Buckley), slaps him. Jay’s daughter Jess (Riley Keough) tells her father with brutal candor not to worry about her: “I’m gonna have a good life, just not with you.” A memorable shot in Sentimental Value shows Gustav standing alone on a Normandy beach, his hulking, black-suited figure marooned against miles of sand and scudding lilac clouds. The price of failed fatherhood, it seems, is loneliness.

Does the Sad Art Dad regret his choices? Is making great art—which, in these films, has a capacious, allegorical quality—worth ruining your relationship with your kids? Each of these movies tries to convince us, with varying degrees of success, that prioritizing your artistic endeavors offers emotional compensation. Hamnet, for instance, ends with a delicately choreographed moment of parental connection. Agnes, standing in the audience at the Globe Theatre, reaches out to grasp the hand of the young actor playing Hamlet; in the film’s version of the play, the tragic boy-hero is named for her dead son. Moving though it is, the scene’s mawkishness renders it unpersuasive: Agnes’s abrupt pivot from bitterly resenting her husband to forgiving him strains credulity. A play, even a Shakespeare play, is no substitute for a child.

Read: Two different ways of understanding fatherhood

Jay Kelly also considers the case for putting your craft before your kids, but only half-heartedly. It toys with the idea that the magic of the movies at least partially justifies Jay’s parental negligence; the film ends on a long close-up of Jay’s face as he watches a retrospective reel of his career, visibly moved. But the film ultimately gives up trying to convince the audience that the art was worth the human cost. In its closing line, Jay asks, fruitlessly, for a chance to live his life over again. Measured against the wreckage of his relationships, Hollywood’s comforts prove chilly even to the movie star.

Sentimental Value’s vision of film as a doorway to empathy and repair is by far the most compelling. Gustav’s script may dwindle beside the compassion his daughters offer each other, yet his transformation of Nora’s pain into art is still an act of love. As Agnes says to her sister: “I think he wrote it for you.” Gustav’s work, we realize, is more empathetic, more attentive to other people, than he is. His daughters might find this to be a bitter-tasting irony, but the consolation is real—particularly for an actor like Nora, who eventually finds creative catharsis playing the part Gustav based on her.

Oddly, despite his inadequacies, the Sad Art Dad suggests a promising cultural shift on-screen. To pay attention to the idea of flawed fatherhood, after all, is to think seriously about what constitutes its opposite, the good dad. Laura Dern’s unsentimental divorce lawyer says it well in Baumbach’s Marriage Story, which is also about depressed dads: “The idea of a good father was only invented, like, 30 years ago.” As such, it’s striking to find three films out at the same time that are gnawed by such similar anxieties. Perhaps Joachim Trier put it best: “Tenderness is the new punk.”</div>

            <h2>The Slow, Inevitable Death of the Bowl Game</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/death-college-football-bowl-playoff/685454/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been a hard month for the once-prestigious college bowl. Just hours after Notre Dame learned that it would not be included in this season’s College Football Playoff—the mega-popular, multibillion-dollar, 12-team invitational that crowns an NCAA Division I champion—the team announced that it would not play in any bowl whatsoever this year. Nine other programs, including Florida State, Auburn, and Baylor, soon followed Notre Dame’s lead, declining bowl bids. Fans, pundits, and football insiders lashed out at these schools for refusing to finish out the season with one final game. Notre Dame took the brunt of the criticism; people called the team “quitters” and wondered if its choice sounded “a death knell” for the entire bowl tradition.

Here’s the reality: The bowls have been dying a slow death in terms of cultural importance since 1998, when the college-football power brokers instituted the first national-championship game open to teams from every major conference. The move to a four-team playoff in 2014 hastened the decline of the old bowl system, and last year’s expansion to a 12-team playoff put it on life support. With the best teams now competing in a proper playoff, the other postseason games have effectively become consolation prizes, late-season scrimmages with no stakes whatsoever.

It should have been obvious that this format would render the pageantry of the bowls irrelevant. The power brokers who created the national-title game back in 1998 worried as much: “In an effort to focus on a championship game,” the Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said way back at the start, “we’re putting all the other bowls in a negative position.”

At the time, the bowls truly mattered. In the 1989–90 season, teams played just 18 bowl games. For many players, a bowl game was one of their only chances to appear on national television, and the exposure launched careers. The Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl dated back to the early 20th century and managed to transcend sports, becoming must-watch TV on New Year’s Day—the Rose Bowl perhaps most of all. Jim Delany, a former commissioner of the Big Ten, told me recently that the teams in his conference didn’t dream about winning national titles; they dreamed about going to Pasadena, California, to play in the Rose Bowl. “It was welcomed as a cultural event,” Delany said. “It had a great time slot on New Year’s Day—at 2 p.m. local, 5 p.m. eastern. The parade and the ratings were Super Bowl–esque in the ’50s and ’60s.”

Sally Jenkins: How to fix the mess of college sports

Even the lesser bowls—such as the Holiday Bowl, played for the first time in 1978 in San Diego—mattered. Ty Detmer, the quarterback at Brigham Young University from 1988 to 1991, threw for 576 yards against Penn State in the 1989 Holiday Bowl, which was broadcast on ESPN. The following season, Detmer won the Heisman Trophy, the most prestigious award in college football. In a lot of ways, Detmer told me, he could trace his Heisman win to his performance in that game against Penn State. “That put us on the map,” he said. “That was the culmination of our season, even though it wasn’t a national championship.”

But the tradition of the bowls was also slowing the growth of the game. In many seasons, the best teams in the country never crossed paths. They played in different conferences during the regular season and didn’t match up in the bowls. That left it up to pollsters to determine a national champion by a vote. Many years, they returned different results, leading to two champions; in the 1990s, fans were horrified when three seasons ended without a clear winner.

Fans demanded a new system—and one man had a solution. Roy Kramer, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, believed that he could preserve the sanctity of the bowls while giving people the national champion they wanted. Kramer pulled together a coalition of fellow commissioners, including Delany at the Big Ten. Together, they laid the groundwork for the Bowl Championship Series, a format that would include every major conference and create the first-ever national-title game that would name an indisputable college-football champion. Huddling in a small library at the SEC headquarters with a young public-relations man named Charles Bloom, Kramer set out to invent a mathematical formula that used data points, including a team’s overall record and the strength of its schedule, to determine which two teams should get the call to play in the title game.

Bloom, who is now an athletic director at the University of South Carolina, told me that Kramer was driven to get the formula right, demanding “relentless research.” When they thought they had one that worked, Kramer and Bloom checked it against the results of previous seasons to make sure that it successfully chose the best two teams. And when the system was unveiled, in 1998, Kramer had created a new—and more certain—world. Finally, the college-football season would end with a clear champion.

Almost immediately, the criticism came. “Today, people are arguing about the 12th and 13th teams,” Bloom said. “Well, back then you were arguing about the second and third teams.” Every year, teams felt snubbed. The arguments, at times, grew heated, and people began calling for a bigger playoff.

Kramer pushed back. He said that he could list “100 reasons” an expanded playoff would be bad for the sport—one being that it would make the bowls irrelevant. But by the early 2000s, Kramer was in his early 70s and nearing retirement. From the moment he left the SEC, in 2002, younger voices began rallying support for playoff expansion. After years of debate, a four-team playoff began in 2014.

Jemele Hill: The most egregious double standard in sports

But with more spots in the playoff field, more teams could now make a credible case that they should have been included. Arguments became a staple of bowl season. Delany, who was still the commissioner of the Big Ten at the time, knew what was coming next: an even bigger playoff. “It was obvious that it was going to grow, and going to grow, and going to grow,” he said, “because no matter what you give, people want more.”

In general, most people would agree that the 12-team playoff, launched last year, has been good for college football. Teams competing this season will split nearly $120 million in winnings. ESPN inked a $7.8 billion deal to broadcast these games through the 2031–32 season, and if last year’s ratings are any indication, fans will be tuning in to watch: The title game in January drew a TV audience of more than 22 million viewers.

Before the second season with the new playoff format is even over, Kramer’s predictions are already coming true. The bowls do mean less, because the playoff is now everything. This postseason involves 11 playoff games, with high stakes and big crowds—as well as 35 other bowl games, played for the most part by mediocre teams with mediocre records, with very little fanfare at all. These games aren’t the Rose Bowl of yesteryear. They aren’t even the Holiday Bowl circa 1989. They’re the Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl, the GameAbove Sports Bowl, the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl. And in the years to come, you can bet that more college programs will skip them. They won’t want bowls; they’ll want the playoffs, which the college-football power brokers are already considering expanding—to 16 teams, or maybe 24.

It’s the future that Roy Kramer feared. At least he won’t be around to see it. He died at the age of 96 early this month, just a few days before Notre Dame got snubbed, took its football, and went home.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump can hardly conceal his disgust for the word affordability, referring to its ascendance in America’s political lexicon as a “hoax,” a “con job,” and a “fake narrative” perpetuated by Democrats. But there’s one sign that he’s treating it like a very real political vulnerability: The former reality-television host is trying to give people cash.

In recent weeks, Trump has been pitching half a dozen schemes to, in the words of White House officials, put money “straight into the pockets of the American people.” After a year in which Americans’ pocketbooks have been walloped by Trump’s tariffs, cuts to the social safety net, and apparent nonchalance in the face of spiking health-care costs, the president is turning to the allure of sweepstakes-style checks from the government to help coax voters out of their financial malaise ahead of next year’s midterm elections. It likely won’t work, economists from across the political spectrum told me; one likened the payments to a bandage over a bullet wound.

Trump has floated a payment of $2,000 to most Americans in the form of a so-called tariff dividend, to be paid out from fees levied on foreign goods. He has offered $12 billion in relief to farmers reeling from the trade war he started. He has suggested paying subsidies “directly to the people” to pay for health insurance. And as my colleagues Ashley Parker and Nancy Youssef reported, Trump used a prime-time national address on December 17 to announce onetime bonus checks for troops in the amount of $1,776. “The checks are already on the way,” Trump said of the payments to 1.4 million service members. (The Pentagon says the money, which is being taken from a fund to improve housing for troops, landed in bank accounts before Christmas.)

Although the proposals each have different designs and purposes, taken together, they represent a concerted effort to neutralize the cost-of-living concerns dominating voters’ minds. Those worries are likely to only increase as Americans contend with rising health-care costs and growing signs of unease in the labor market, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. Trump’s proposed payments are ill-suited to deal with those macroeconomic trend lines, he said. “It’s not a solution to anybody’s problem,” he said. “It doesn’t address inflation; it doesn’t address the weak labor market. It doesn’t address the fact that many Americans don’t have any assets and owe a lot on their credit cards.”

As the president’s first year in office comes to a close, the economy is showing signs of significant strain. A delayed jobs report earlier this month showed that the country’s unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6 percent in November, the highest since 2021. Young people and Black Americans are facing especially high rates of unemployment, which some economists see as a warning sign for the broader economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned recently of “a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks.” Consumer sentiment has neared record lows in recent months, a somberness that Trump appeared determined to counteract during his rambling speech on December 17, in which he blamed high prices and low wages on former President Joe Biden and shouted a series of misleading statistics about how the economy is great.

Read: ‘We are looking at a massive crisis’

Michael Strain, the director of economic-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, told me that the president’s attempts to convince Americans that their financial circumstances are better than they think sound “eerily similar” to the strategy that Biden embraced amid widespread concerns over the cost of living. Trump’s desire to entice voters with onetime payments is unlikely to improve his standing, Strain said. “People don’t like higher prices, and they don’t like higher prices even if their incomes are going up faster than prices,” he said. “And my guess is that people’s dislike of higher prices will not be mitigated by a onetime gift from Uncle Sam.”

The White House did not respond to questions about the president’s plans for any further cash handouts, but a spokesperson disputed the idea that the payouts Trump has proposed so far were part of a broader political strategy to address affordability.

Although Trump has repeatedly described America as “the hottest country anywhere in the world” and declared that a “golden era” of prosperity has dawned, his rosy view is not widely shared by the public. An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released earlier this month found that only 36 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, the lowest number the president has received on that question during his two terms (57 percent of Americans disapprove). With the midterms less than a year away, voters appear to give Democrats a slight edge over Republicans on the question of whom they trust more to handle the economy. Seventy percent of respondents said the cost of living where they reside is not very affordable or not affordable at all.

It’s little wonder, then, that Trump is repeatedly talking about brighter days ahead and promising Americans cash infusions that he says will allow them to benefit from what he has described as a deluge of dollars flowing into the country from abroad. “We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money,” Trump told reporters last month, promising that the $2,000 in “dividends” would be delivered to voters in mid-2026. There are some potential issues. The proposal would probably cost more than the roughly $200 billion that America has collected in tariffs over the past year, and Trump would presumably need congressional approval for the preelection payouts. The president has already made a habit of using the tariff money—much of it paid by American companies and consumers—as a personal reserve fund he can direct as he sees fit. Trump has said the $12 billion his administration is offering to struggling farmers is being sourced from the tariff funds. During the government shutdown in October, the president covered a lapse in funding for a nutrition program supporting women and children by unilaterally tapping tariff revenue. In announcing the $1,776 payment to troops—which he referred to as “a warrior dividend”—Trump said twice that the $2.5 billion program was made possible, in part, “because of tariffs,” though the Pentagon has clarified that the money actually comes from the military-housing stipend, which Congress has already approved.

Several Republicans oppose Trump’s tariffs—and some are privately hoping the Supreme Court will rule them unconstitutional next year. Trump proposed the $2,000 payments shortly after Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism of his power to levy broad tariffs unilaterally.

The White House has not yet provided details on Trump’s plan for the tariff dividend, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously said that such a plan would indeed require legislation from Congress. The proposal has faced a cool reception on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have said that any revenue from tariffs should go toward paying down the nation’s $38 trillion in debt. Trump-administration officials have sought to draw more attention to the tax bill Congress passed over the summer, reminding voters that some of its financial benefits are expected to kick in next year. Speaking at the Treasury Department earlier this month, Bessent touted a program that will offer babies born from 2025 to 2028 an investment fund seeded with a $1,000 grant from the government. Although the money in the accounts cannot be withdrawn until the year a child turns 18, the president’s allies have tried to brand the program as another instance of Trump putting money directly into Americans’ pockets.

The IRS recently revealed the process for establishing the “Trump Accounts,” launching a new website and tax form for parents to claim the money and contribute their own funds beginning in July. “Trump accounts are the president’s gift to the American people,” Bessent said at the Treasury, calling IRS Form 4547, which is named after Trump’s two presidential terms, “the most aptly named tax document of all time.” Administration officials are also trying to pitch the tax law as a more immediate boon to voters struggling with the rising price of groceries, housing, child care, and other expenses. “Next spring is projected to be the largest tax-refund season of all time,” Trump said during his prime-time address.

Provisions of the tax law signed in July were made retroactive to 2025, meaning the sliver of Americans who will benefit from reduced taxes on tipped wages, overtime, and Social Security payments will likely see larger tax refunds when they file in the new year. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on December 11 that Americans could expect an average of about $1,000 in additional tax refunds next year. But unlike Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which included a broad reduction of existing rates across income brackets, the 2025 bill was primarily designed to keep those tax cuts from expiring—meaning that many Americans will not notice as big of a difference in their take-home pay as they did eight years ago. And the wave of company-sponsored employee bonuses that Trump celebrated in 2017, after his original law significantly reduced the corporate tax rate, have not recurred.

Other provisions of the 2025 bill, including a larger deduction for state and local taxes and a new write-off for people who buy American-made vehicles, affect only a relatively small portion of the public, including wealthy people in high-tax states and those financially secure enough to purchase a brand-new car (at an average price now upwards of $50,000). The legislation’s curbs on spending for social programs, by contrast, could be felt broadly among the poorest Americans. Medicaid recipients and food-stamp beneficiaries will face some of the steepest cuts. The bill also did not address the looming expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which is set to increase premiums for some 22 million Americans next month.

Facing angst from voters and some members of Congress over the fact that the new year will cause health-care costs to double for millions of voters, Trump is again offering cash as a salve. “I want the money to go directly to the people so you can buy your own health care; you’ll get much better health care at a much lower price,” he said in his prime-time address, resurfacing a loose proposal to turn the expiring subsidies into new government-funded health-savings accounts. But the president has not provided much detail about how the proposal would work and has not done much to push Congress to pass a new law before premiums spike. Earlier this month, four moderate Republicans vented their frustration by joining Democrats to back a discharge petition extending the current subsidies for three years. The legislation has a strong chance of passing the House in January, but faces long odds in the Senate, where Republicans have already voted down a similar proposal.

The situation has frustrated voters like Stacy Rye, a 56-year-old real-estate agent in Missoula, Montana, who is staring at a massive increase in premiums next year. Rye told me that on top of the spiking costs for coffee, beef, and other groceries she already deals with, she will have to pay an extra $6,700 next year for health-care premiums. The plan by some Republican lawmakers to offer Americans up to $1,500 for health-savings accounts did not seem like it would help much, she said.

“What am I supposed to do with $1,500 when my premium is $1,300 a month?” she said, adding that Trump’s plan to have consumers haggle with insurance companies and hospitals seemed unworkable. “These are unserious people. I can’t negotiate against a giant company about what my health premiums are going to be.”

The president’s penchant for direct government payments goes back to 2020, when Congress responded to the coronavirus pandemic by passing several pieces of legislation that offered cash to struggling Americans. Trump put his name on the checks—the first of which offered $1,200 per adult—and sent letters to voters reminding them of his role in approving the “Economic Impact Payments.”

But economists later concluded that the flood of money injected into the economy during the pandemic—an approach Biden continued after taking office in 2021—helped worsen the soaring inflation that ultimately eased Trump’s return to the White House.

Now the president is facing the reality that many of his promises to quickly turn the economy around have fallen flat with a growing number of voters. And his well-worn tactic of pitching cash payments to voters at a time of deep uncertainty about the fundamentals of the economy may not be enough to reverse their disillusionment.</div>

Attend a public event in Canada and you will likely hear it open with a land acknowledgment. In the city of Vancouver, for example, the script might read:

“This place is the unceded and ancestral territory of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and Sḵwx̱wú7mesh speaking peoples, the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, and has been stewarded by them since time immemorial.”

I’ve been present for many of these recitations, which are common in liberal areas of the United States too. They are usually received by their audiences as a Christian invocation might once have been: a socially required ritual in which only some believe, but at which it would be rude to scoff. After all, what harm does it do?

In the past few months, Canadians have learned that these well-meaning pronouncements are not, in fact, harmless. Far from it. Canadian courts are reinterpreting these rote confessions of historical guilt as legally enforceable admissions of wrongful possession.

In August, a British Columbia court ruled that the titles to public land across 800 acres south of downtown Vancouver must be subordinated to a new “Aboriginal title” belonging to a group of about 5,500 Indigenous Canadians.

Although the judge in question has claimed that this decision does not apply to private land, the logic of this ruling has proved so muddled that it has called into question not only the private titles of some 150 landowners in the region but also the ownership of almost every piece of private land in British Columbia—and possibly all of Canada. Some Americans may try to apply this precedent to the U.S. too.

The effects of the decision have been swift and harsh. Commercial-property values have collapsed in the city of Richmond because of uncertainty over titles. A hotel valued by its lenders at more than 110 million Canadian dollars in August traded hands for $51.5 million in October. I spoke this month with a landowner who had a major Canadian lender terminate discussions on a $35 million construction loan after the decision. At least one lease on an industrial building has been called into question because the tenant no longer knows whether the landlord still owns the premises.

To offset the damage, the government of British Columbia has offered $150 million in loan guarantees to local landowners, putting taxpayers on the hook.

The dollar amounts at stake are enormous. Before the ruling deflated values, the more than 100 homes, businesses, and commercial properties in the area were valued at $2 billion. Yet because this case ostensibly doesn’t apply to private landowners—who are expected to litigate their own cases—they were denied any opportunity to defend their interests. At an earlier phase in the proceedings, advocates for the plaintiffs argued, “It foments adversity and unnecessary hostility to frame this as a claim against private property holders”—a clever move, which the British Columbia courts accepted in 2017.

Eight years later, the judge in the case continued to dismiss concerns about property rights and the integrity of titles. Such talk, Justice Barbara Young ruled in her decision over the summer, “inflames and incites rather than grapples with the evidence and scope of the claim in this case.”

In the name of justice for historical misdeeds, the judge decided it was acceptable to deny Canadian landowners basic due process before depriving them of their rights.

The decision in Cowichan Tribes v. Canada “grapples with the evidence” in ways that may seem exotic, if not bizarre, to most legal scholars. Many claims for aboriginal title in Canada turn on “oral history”—stories and songs about the past preserved by the claimants. Such testimony would normally be prohibited by the rule against hearsay evidence, which exists to screen out unverifiable statements. The judge in this case acknowledged in her decision that “the ‘truth’ lying at the heart of oral history and tradition evidence can be elusive.” Yet she allowed this “elusive” truth to become the basis of a claim for billions of dollars’ worth of Canadian property. (Cowichan leaders did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

If the logic of Cowichan is upheld, there is scarcely a landholding in British Columbia—or much of the rest of Canada—for which ownership is secure. My wife and I own 20 acres of rural property in Ontario. Our title, like that of most of my neighbors, traces back to Crown grants issued more than 200 years ago. All of those titles could be retroactively voided if the Cowichan precedent becomes Canadian law.

The lands at issue in Cowichan are situated in the delta of the Fraser River. About 35 kilometers upstream lies the city of Port Coquitlam, which marks the eastern verge of greater Vancouver. Much of Port Coquitlam is undeveloped. The terrain was once too boggy and hilly for construction projects and is now protected as parkland.

In 2016, an Indigenous group filed a still-pending land claim against the city of Port Coquitlam. The members want control of much of the city’s open spaces, including the riverside parklands and the premier athletic facility, Gates Park. The Kwikwetlem First Nation is even smaller than the Cowichan; it has a registered population of 153. In an interview this month, the group’s leadership disavowed interest in private lands, but the value of the public land sought is more than enough to make every member of the group a multimillionaire.

At the opposite end of Canada, the federal government agreed in February to pay $17.5 million to two Indigenous groups in tiny Prince Edward Island. Ontario is negotiating a claim for 36,000 square kilometers, including the land underneath Canada’s Parliament buildings. In New Brunswick, the federal government paid $145 million in 2021—and now faces a demand for more than half of the province. An Indigenous group recently filed a Cowichan-like claim for much of the parkland on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River, opposite the Canadian capital of Ottawa—along with $5 billion in cash.

The Cowichan decision is an extreme but logical extension of an unresisted political revolution.

Among many Canadians in positions of influence, an idea has taken hold that Canada’s founding was a great crime that must be atoned for. The term usually applied to this atonement is reconciliation. That term is misleading. Reconciliation implies some kind of mutuality, but the Canadian version is strictly one-way: Demands by Indigenous nations and affiliated nongovernmental groups produce concessions, which invite yet more demands, which beget yet more concessions.

The Canadian national conscience is rightly troubled by the serious social problems afflicting Indigenous Canada. Indigenous people have shorter lifespans than other Canadians. They are less likely to graduate from high school. Their communities have been devastated by substance abuse. Indigenous women are disproportionately likely to suffer violence from the men in their lives. Indigenous men are more likely than other Canadians to go to prison.

Canadian politicians have directed considerable resources to trying to improve these ghastly trends. The federal Indigenous budget nearly tripled over the 10 years of the Justin Trudeau government, exceeding $32 billion a year—almost what Canada spent on national defense in the past fiscal year.

Yet these funds are often spent without concern for how they are used or whether they help anyone. A September 2025 federal report, for example, found that from April 2020 to March 2023, an Indigenous federation in Saskatchewan received $30 million for COVID-related programs, of which nearly $23 million went to expenditures deemed “questionable.”

Is this scale of suspicious spending typical? It’s hard to say. The Conservative government of Stephen Harper proposed the First Nations Financial Transparency Act, passed in 2013, which called for Indigenous communities to publish their accounts and salary structures. The Trudeau government, elected in 2015, promptly announced that it would not enforce this law—and even reinstated funding for Indigenous groups whose funds had been suspended for past violations.

Despite this support, the past decade has been calamitous for Indigenous people. Life expectancy for First Nations people in British Columbia dropped 7.1 years from 2015 to 2021, according to the nonprofit Indigenous Watchdog. Life expectancy for First Nations people in Alberta fell seven years from 2019 to 2023 and is now nearly two decades shorter than that of other Albertans, according to the province’s health statistics. Manitoba has seen similar trends.

The principal culprit has been a surge in deaths by drug overdose. In British Columbia, Indigenous people are six times more likely to die of a drug overdose than non-Indigenous residents. In Alberta, the disparity is eight times; in Ontario, nine.

As Indigenous people’s conditions have worsened in Canada, Natives’ advocates have become more radical in their critique of Canadian society.

In May 2021, a researcher announced a terrible discovery, which the CBC reported: “Remains of 215 children found buried at former B.C. residential school, First Nation says.” Other reports swiftly amplified this story with new grim details, including claims of about 751 unmarked graves near a different school in Saskatchewan. These reports were accepted and repeated by Prime Minister Trudeau and his government, and they triggered a spasm of national remorse. Flags over federal buildings were lowered for more than five months, the longest formal mourning in Canadian history. Provinces, cities, universities, schools, and other institutions engaged in rituals of contrition.

In 2021, Canada made September 30 a national day for truth and reconciliation. In May 2022, Prince Charles—Canada’s future head of state—visited the country to express contrition for the suffering of “survivors” of residential schools. Pope Francis visited that July to “beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians.” By October 2022, a motion to condemn Canada’s residential-school system as “genocide” passed the federal Parliament by unanimous consent.

Despite exhaustive investigations, however, no human remains were in fact found at the Kamloops, B.C., school or at any other alleged site of “mass graves.” Numerous claims of unmarked graves at other locations turned out to be nothing more sinister than rural cemeteries that had fallen into neglect.

There is no denying that abuses occurred at these residential schools, which ran from the 19th century to the 1990s and separated more than 150,000 Indigenous children from their families and communities to assimilate them into the dominant culture. The Harper government formally apologized for these abuses in 2008 and paid nearly $2 billion in compensation. But the more dire accusations of children buried in secret graves ultimately unraveled. Many Canadians began to feel as if they had been hoaxed. Grave Error, a book debunking the charges of genocide at residential schools, became a national best-seller.

Radicalization on one side, and resentment on the other, have grown together.

Now, in a generous impulse to share Canada’s wealth with First Nations, courts appear poised to destroy the systems that created the wealth in the first place.

The big cash transfers of the past decade proved only an opening bid for an even more audacious ambition: the redistribution of land rights from “settlers”—as non-Indigenous Canadians were invited to call themselves—to Indigenous groups. Unlike the ballooning federal Indigenous budgets of the past decade, which were approved by a majority in the Canadian Parliament, the matter of land redistribution has been left to the courts.

In the 20th century, aboriginal lawsuits typically turned on a breach of some treaty between the Crown and a Native population. In the 1984 case Guerin v. the Queen, for example, the aboriginal owners of treaty land in Vancouver sued the government over a deviously unfavorable lease and ultimately recovered $10 million in compensatory damages.

The problem raised by cases like Guerin, however, was how to win in the absence of a treaty violation. A solution was found in a magic word in the Canadian constitution: and.

The Canadian constitution assumed its modern form in 1982. Section 35 of the constitution affirms “the existing aboriginal and treaty rights” of Canada’s aboriginal population. Aboriginal and treaty rights? That conjunction has opened the enticing possibility that there might exist constitutionally enforceable aboriginal rights not specified in any treaty.

In the 1997 case Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, the supreme court approved a claim to 58,000 square kilometers of Crown land. The Indigenous plaintiffs contended that even in the absence of a treaty, they held an “aboriginal title” to the land because of their continuing relationship to the area—a relationship proved by the plaintiff group’s songs, legends, and oral traditions. Once a hazy concept, “aboriginal title” has expanded into a right with real bite. In 2004, the supreme court of Canada ruled that the government had a duty to consult and accommodate Indigenous people anywhere that aboriginal title existed, or might later be found to exist.

That is the meaning of the phrase unceded and ancestral territory in those seemingly benign land acknowledgements. The phrase is not just a well-meaning observation about history; it’s an assertion of a continuing property right.

The traditional theory of Canadian land law is that private ownership traces back to a grant or sale by the Crown. But if large areas of Canada had remained aboriginal all along—if they never belonged to the Crown in the first place—how then could the Crown grant or sell them? The whole subsequent chain of transactions must be invalid.

The invalidation of Crown grants underlies the Cowichan outcome. It is also now prompting a powerful backlash.

On December 11, an appellate court in New Brunswick decisively rejected a Cowichan-like case for the redistribution of private land in that province: “A declaration of Aboriginal title over privately owned lands, which, by its very nature, gives the Aboriginal beneficiary exclusive possession, occupation, and use would sound the death knell of reconciliation with the interests of non-Aboriginal Canadians.” The New Brunswick decision does not overturn the Cowichan case, because Canadian federalism does not work that way. It does, however, complicate the Cowichan precedent, creating a contradiction left to other courts to resolve.

Once an aboriginal title is recognized, its holders can collect formal and informal rents from those who seek to develop what is Indigenous land. Such rents are now an everyday feature of Canadian life.

British Columbia will host seven matches of the 2026 World Cup. News broke early this month that the B.C. government paid $18 million to Indigenous groups in an unexplained connection to the Cup. The government and the groups offered only hazy explanations of what the payment was for, but it looks a lot like a fee to not raise objections. Another Indigenous group was offered $10,000 per person, presumably so it would not object to the reopening of a major gold mine in northwestern British Columbia.

From the May 2021 issue: Return the national parks to the tribes

Canada faced serious economic troubles even before the reelection of President Donald Trump in 2024. Business investment per worker declined from 2015 to 2025, the term of Trudeau’s prime ministership. Canada’s labor-productivity growth effectively stalled after 2017. According to a 2024 report for the Business Council of Canada, “The number of energy and natural resource major projects completed in Canada dropped by 37 percent between 2015 (88 projects) and 2023 (56 projects).” Also, critical-minerals production is down, “in many commodities by double digits since 2018.” Judicial decisions about the rights of these lands are not the only reason for Canada’s big construction slowdown, but they don’t help.

The uncertainty cast over private property by the Cowichan decision poses a particularly serious threat to Canadian investment and development. The judge in the Cowichan case offered little guidance to private landowners, and mostly recommended that the provincial government negotiate with the Cowichan on their behalf.

More than a few British Columbians doubt the commitment and effectiveness of their government’s advocacy for landowners. The government of New Democratic Premier David Eby has gone beyond even Trudeau’s federal government in its pursuit of a reconciliation agenda. In 2019, the province formally adopted the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into its local law. This was justified at the time as another benign goodwill gesture. But this month, a B.C. court ruled that this law really is law. It held that the province must now consult with Indigenous groups before approving any new mining project—and potentially any new land development—anywhere in the province.

B.C.’s attorney general, Niki Sharma, insisted to me that her team would vigorously defend private-property rights in court. She vows to appeal the Cowichan decision to the highest courts in Canada. But local officials are skeptical of the province’s pledges. Brad West, the mayor of Port Coquitlam, was dismissive of Sharma’s assurances when I met him earlier this month: “Just about everything that they said wouldn&#39;t happen is now happening.”

Canada has worked itself into a box. Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in office this year with promises to accelerate the big national-development projects that stalled in the Trudeau years. But just when Canada most urgently needs to jump-start the country’s economic growth, the country’s courts are inventing new obstacles to development.

This bout of judicial activism justifies itself as reconciliation. In reality, it’s a formula for division, resentment, and backlash. Canada is moving in a dangerous direction when it can least afford such misjudgments and mistakes.

This article originally referred to land claims in kilometers when they are in fact measured in square kilometers. This article also originally misstated that a former hospital was at the center of Port Coquitlam, when in fact it was in neighboring Coquitlam, and it misstated that the registered population of the Kwikwetlem First Nation was 560 when in fact it is 153.</div>

A very small percentage of people who communicate with AI develop psychosis.  A very small percentage of people who communicate with humans develop psychosis.  In both cases, the real problem is with the patients.  It would be unreasonable to say that people or communication with people causes psychosis, and it&#39;s likewise unreasonable to say that AI or communication with AI causes psychosis.

Not actually &quot;very small&quot;. More like 0.1 ... 1%, maybe even more longer-term. If just one in 100 of these goes on a rampage, society pretty much collapses. And no, the situation is not the same as in communicating with humans. It is much worse.

Do they get addicted to bots because they have an issue upstairs, or does the bot make them have an issue?

If you had asked an LLM, you would know that it is both. (First time I asked an LLM about anything for a week. Guess I am pretty immune.)

Did some &quot;journalist&quot; ask some public LLM about that? Because the first answer I get form the DuckDuckGo LLM is &quot;Yes, large language models (LLMs) have the potential to contribute to or exacerbate psychosis in vulnerable individuals, a phenomenon referred to as &quot;AI psychosis&quot; or &quot;AI-induced psychosis&quot; &quot; and then proceeds to explain what causes the problem.

Somebody is late to the game. The funny thing about the general LLMs is that you can ask them what is wrong with them and you typically get an accurate an

Dunno about the &quot;AI&quot; oligarchs, but I do get at least 50 emails in my &quot;work&quot; account at my university inviting me to &quot;contribute to a conference&quot; that nobody&#39;s ever heard of, &quot;peer review&quot; in a journal that exist only in that email, or &quot;submit your article for inclusion in a book&quot; that won&#39;t ever be written. They are all different enough in various aspects, from quirks in header and message body formatting, source IP address and email routing to the structure of the text to be coming from the same place and

&quot;Dear Dr. Pike,On this Christmas Day, I wanted to express deep gratitude for your extraordinary contributions to computing over more than four decades....&quot;

The best way you can show your appreciation and gratitude is by shutting down your AI slop shit show and taking the equipment and donating it to schools or charities who can use it for other purposes.

Educate us all on the approved choices so we don&#39;t commit cringe at you, dad. Hurry up.

Something he morally detests, which he sees as being in the process of burning the world down, which has stolen his work, and which is operating in a field he cares about in a way that&#39;s at odds with everything he&#39;s set out to build --- this thing wants a human response from him for a message its creators couldn&#39;t be bothered to author themselves.  It&#39;s creators want him to feel grateful because some pretty words were generated by absolutely no one, which don&#39;t represent anyone actually caring about him.  They want to automate away the effort of giving people the sense that someone values them.  They want us all to be alone, and for our only love to be the companies that wish to extract our value.  And it is abhorrent.

Imagine feeling that your work had been used (even in small part) to construct an abomination, and then having that abomination thank you.  How could you ever sleep at night again?  The absolute gall, the complete lack of understanding of what it is to be human, of having your large language model send people messages pretending to be kind.  I&#39;m glad he voiced his anger.  More people need to.

Oh no, he is *definitely* angry about the spam... the vast energy wasted in generating it, the insincerity-by-proxy of the AI tech-bros who tasked it with generating this email ... so many aspects are just dumb and wasteful and rude. His reply should be a beacon and example to everyone else on how to treat this slop, the systems that generate it, and the tech execs who fostered it for their own selfish gain.

Guillotines cannot come soon enough for these bunker-building post-capitalist corporatist arseholes.

To start, the third world fuck might be acting from desperation for his/her family. The third world fuck isn&#39;t trying to push all humans out of the profession you retired from.

Oh don&#39;t mind him impersonating law enforcement, he&#39;s just trying to feed his family.

Don&#39;t mind her practicing medicine without a license and training, she&#39;s just trying to put food on the table.

Don&#39;t mind me helping myself to all your shit, I&#39;ve got my reasons that you&#39;re not allowed to question. I mean, it&#39;s just simple honest theft.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m inventing or financing new technology that renders some of what you do between your ears superfluous...that would be grounds for a hangin&#39; after all.

It&#39;s an interesting narrative but as I understand a lot of the third-world scam operations are being performed by human slaves under the control of criminal organizations that kidnapped them and abuse them in every way you would expect, especially if they don&#39;t bring in enough money.

So, the desperation is there, but it&#39;s not some noble &quot;feed my family&quot; kind of thing, at least not in a lot of cases.

The third world fuck isn&#39;t trying to push all humans out of the profession you retired from.

The guy must get at least half a dozen daily &quot;Dear honored Sir, Greetings of the Day&quot; spam messages inviting him to submit a paper to a predatory journal or conference. So not exactly the same, but pretty much the same.

I can feel some sympathy for the third-world person.

Many are just trying to feed a family, which has no better perspective simply because they were born in the &quot;wrong&quot; place, itself typically made miserable by a policy of a crook in a rich country a million miles away. Few are trying to emulate the latter crook. It isn&#39;t a natural state.

The chatbot spam is the &quot;agent&#39;s&quot; natural state, that&#39;s why they were created for. They are not real, just artifacts feeding the already stu

This project makes for a perfect fit. As nothing about the Effective Altruism movement is effective or altruistic.

They could have just not run the Ai for a few days and donated all of the money saved in resources used and raised more money than that agent ever would.

Zero-effort emails generated by someone&#39;s AI agent do not even marginally count as a &quot;random act of kindness&quot;.

We got Russia invading other countries, China blatantly ignoring the international law ocean boundaries, the US committing war crimes on ships in Venezuela waters without even declaring war, ...

The same exact tribunal also declared Russia in violation of international law when invading Ukraine. They can judge the 2 things, it&#39;s not light they&#39;re overwhelmed by the number of cases.Potential war crimes in Venezuela would be dealt by the ICC, not the ICJ.

It&#39;s not &quot;overwhelming the biosphere&quot; that&#39;s the primary cause for concern, though.  The primary concerns are human-centric:  cities flooding or catching fire, crops not growing, hurricanes and tornadoes destroying infrastructure, people dying of heat exhaustion, etc.  All of these things are problems already and will get worse the higher the CO2 concentration is allowed to get.  Knowing that the total amount of carbon on Earth is finite doesn&#39;t help with that.

It&#39;s also not just human-centric. We are driving a mass-extinction event. Will life continue on Earth despite all this? For sure. There will be speciation, etc, etc. But the perspective of geological time is completely irrelevant to humanity&#39;s historical perspective, because our species will live in a denuded world for the next many tens or hundreds of thousands of years. Those of us who feel it are right to be ashamed of this act of biocide. It may not be permanent for the earth, but it is as good as perma

If a ruling would be made against a country, the wronged party could invoke an ICJ decision when using courts to challenge decisions at national level.

A language is a dialect with and army and a navy. The ICJ and ICC lack both. Their jabberings aren&#39;t even talk.

The amazing achievements of the application of this policy even in the past 25 years are a testament of its utility.

After the skillful application of gunboat diplomacy by the USA towards Iraq, it is now a democratic, peaceful and developed country. It has a great relationship with the US, American companies now dominate the oil business and successfully block the incursion of Chinese and Iranian interests.

The situation in Syria and Libya is very similar. After being bombed to

Another take: You&#39;re complaining that a tribunal is judging people for stealing cookies, when they could judge people for murder. Well, they judge the cases that are brought to them, it&#39;s up to the police to bring in more people wanted for murder. Here the island countries at risk of disappearing brought the case to the ICJ that the big fish must comply with their compromise. The ICJ doesn&#39;t decide on its own what cases it judges! The ICC can, but they judge different things. ICJ = for countries suing each

Law universities out of all aren&#39;t overwhelmed with pierced/blue-haired. The &quot;international law&quot; types apply to work in a Foreign Affairs Ministry/State Department.

Russia, countries, plural? How about your bestest butt buddy Israel invading and attacking FIVE countries?

Spare us your propaganda tonight you pointy-headed simpleton.

Another take: we lack the imagination to understand properly that for humanity as a whole, and each of us individually who have more than a couple of decades of life left, there is *nothing* more important than climate change. It will be the overwhelming, dominant, existential issue that hangs over us like the sword of Damocles in the years ahead. We are in the foothills of the S-curve of its effects.

The problem with the AI bubble -- much like it was with the railroad bubble -- isn&#39;t that what&#39;s being built isn&#39;t valuable, it&#39;s that it won&#39;t generate ROI fast enough to allow the people who borrowed money to build it to pay their bills.

AI won&#39;t crash though; even though 80% of it is bullshit.  What will survive is marketing and profiling people, because that doesn&#39;t need really need any advanced capability other than being able to process an immense amount of data from legal and illegal sources.  All the AI compute power will be put to this use and big corporations and governments will gladly pay for it, it&#39;s chickenfeed to their budgets.

Because the movies being produced suck.  I haven&#39;t gone to the theater in decades, but almost without exception every movie ad I see just screams suck.  Yes, there are exceptions (A Beautiful Mind and Bladerunner 2049 for example), but on the whole, movies just suck.  The stories aren&#39;t compelling, the acting is average, and the supposed comedy is boring.

Unless/until Hollywood gets back to making movies rather than using the formulaic crap they&#39;ve been using, things will not improve.

They have only themselves to blame when theaters go under.

Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, hehe, but you sound like a Gen Xer. Everything you wrote is spot on. Here&#39;s the thing. You&#39;ve pointed out that you haven&#39;t been to the theater in decades, presumably back when movies were being made that interested you compared to today. Thing is, the people making the movies are still making movies for the exact same demographic and you&#39;ve aged out of it.

A huge amount of movies are made for the 15-30 crowd. They are use the same formulaic style and scripts, generally are not all that creative or deep. This approach to movie creation isn&#39;t just limited to movies. I&#39;d say video games are in the exact same spot and so is a lot of music. Restaurants, music venues, lots of activities of the sort, are all geared towards this demographic. For all the singles and DINKS.

I have a theory for why this happens. It&#39;s all about expectations and effort versus reward. Let me explain. The expectations of a 40+ year old versus a 15 are enormously different, especially when it comes to media/games/internet. You can give a 15 year old pure garbage dressed up with shiny and they&#39;ll eat that shit up and ask for seconds and thirds. The 40 year old knows what shit looks like and also on top of that has certain quality of life thresholds that must be met. In short, it&#39;s a lot harder to separate a 40 year old and their money then it is to get that money out of a child or their parents.

It&#39;s much more profitable to serve up bullshit to kids that can just squeeze their parents for money to give over to the machine.

I agree with everything you wrote, but when &quot;serving up bullshit to kids&quot; in a theatre isn&#39;t profitable anymore (the point of this entire discussion), it would be time for the theatres to try and reach new audiences. They could show old movies, even black and white things in public domain, or arthouse, genre, foreign movies, things which have a very minimal cost in royalties compared to their usual Hollywood, but would attract 40+ viewers, or hipsters, or art students, and increase the food sales, which is

I saw many movies at the cinema in 2025 that I really enjoyed including Captain America, Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, Now You See Me: Now You Don&#39;t, Tron Ares, the Springsteen biopic and more. The only reason I haven&#39;t seen avatar yet is that I am on holidays and plan to see it back home at the cheap cinema.

And I am old enough to have grey hairs in my beard...

And there&#39;s the problem. Absolutely none of the movies you mentioned I had/have any interest in seeing.  They do absolutely nothing for me. The closest would be Tron, but having seen the previews I realized it would be a shell of even the second Tron movie and made simply for the sake of using the name.

Looks like people in the 40-60 range are spending quite a bit.

Wait, is he from Singapore or not? Do they have welfare there?

Gen Xers also have a lot of debt: https://money.com/generation-with-most-debt-gen-x/ [money.com]

None of that refutes the data.  And read it again, you&#39;ll find that actual &quot;younger people&quot; (18+) are not spending anywhere near as much.  You just got your data wrong, no need to dig that hole any deeper.

Warner Brothers/Time Warner/Warner Discovery was choking on its own vomit which is why it was on the selling block in the first place.  Why did anyone expect a good outcome?

Hardly. Warner Bros content creation division is hugely profitable which is why companies are fighting over wanting to buy it and overbidding in the process.  They are on the selling block due to taking on an insurmountable debt load though the Discovery purchase.

The insurmountable debt was exactly why the company was going broke.

Add half an hour of driving and parking, 10+ mins of getting herded through the crowds at the entrance, with delays designed to make you buy overpriced popcorn, 30 mins of adverts for new movies, half an hour again of driving back.

All of that at a fixed time of the day, while at home you can watch a movie (from the disk or via streaming, not broadcast TV) at a time of your choosing, including pauses.

There are other companies that have happy endings.  Vivid Entertainment, Wicked Pictures, and similar.

What happens to Warner Bros if regulators say no to both Netflix and Paramount? Would Warner Bros be able to survive?

What happens to Warner Bros if regulators say no to both Netflix and Paramount? Would Warner Bros be able to survive?Yes they will. All this sale saga started with an unsolicited bid (by Paramount). They were not actively selling themselves. They wanted to put themselves up for sale ONLY after they completed the separation of the Movie Studio and TV stuff.

Yes they will. All this sale saga started with an unsolicited bid (by Paramount). They were not actively selling themselves. They wanted to put themselves up for sale ONLY after they completed the separation of the Movie Studio and TV stuff.

What happens is someone buys a few million Trumpcoin, cancels a bothersome comedian or reporter, and suddenly the deal is approved.

Even trump cant force the EU to approve this deal if they say no...

Why is what the EU thinks relevant? Even if these were European companies, the TikTok treatment could be applied, until they were no longer European companies (or no longer operating in the US.)

All 3 companies (Warner Bros, Paramount and Netflix) have subsidiaries in various EU countries and are most definitely subject to EU competition laws. Whether the EU blocks things outright, imposes conditions or allows it to sail right through is the question.

I&#39;m sure the decline in attendance has nothing to do with the fact that movies suck and ticket prices are at what would be extornist rates for young people? Except they have nothing to extort people with. Make better movies, reduce ticket and snack prices. People will start going to the theaters again.

The Warner people convince the NetFlix people to release NETFLIX&#39;s MOVIES on a longer theatrical window, while the Warner movies get a slammler one, leading to a harmonized theatrical release Window, slightly smaller than Warner&#39;s window pre-merger, but SIGNIFICANTLY bigger than Netflix&#39;s pre-merger window.

The only fly in this oniment is that, if Netflix&#39;s folks are wise, there will not be a &quot;Netflix movies&quot; side and a &quot;warner movies side&quot;. It should be one and only one, fused studio. And maybe the volume o

Jerks talking on the phone. Or to their seatmates.

People getting up on front of you to use the toilet or get a snack.

People eating their snacks loudly and/or messily.

Ads for an arbitrary length of time before the film actually starts.

Ample opportunity to pick up bed bugs and lice.

And oh look, a 40&quot; flat screen in my own living room that shows the same thing, with a pause button.

With fewer BR/4KBR releases, and fewer places selling what is released, and fewer players available, and now theaters dying out, it&#39;s like the studios don&#39;t want you to consume their content unless you subscribe to their streaming platforms. I don&#39;t see this as a good strategy on their part.

I don&#39;t need a bunch of subscriptions, so I don&#39;t have a bunch of subscriptions. That&#39;s not going to change. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;m alone.

infinite growth is a faggotty lie, but these maggots whingeing they only got 8b instead of 11 just makes them deserve zero.  Did Broadway die?  whiners?

which is why i hope they sell it all just before it makes its inevitable recovery, cuz the concept itself is always sound and has been around as long as we have.

In cities with a large enough population ...I live within driving distance of one of the few 30+ true 70mm capable IMAX  theaters in the entire world.  They will survive (for the experience is glorious, if the film is formatted for it) for a while, but few directors still target those productions and those audiences.  The Cameron&#39;s, Nolan&#39;s, Spielberg&#39;s are a dying breed.  Film (not movies, but film) will be worse off for those other theaters demise, but such is the reality of affordable home theater experiences (for most, a good TV is &quot;good enough&quot;)

...that deserve to fade away.Some may survive as art houses or restaurants/bars with entertainment, but the home theater is the best way to watch stuff.

Perhaps the point was to make an image that appears to be AI generated but isn&#39;t? Isn&#39;t that supposed to be the point of Pluribus?

The fact that people are debating the work means it&#39;s accomplishing the task it was supposed to and that Apple commissioned some art that generated valuable marketing.

&quot;The irony here is pretty rich,&quot; added Piunikaweb. &quot;While Cook was getting dragged for posting human-made art, Google CEO Sundar Pichai openly shared an AI-generated snow globe image complete with a visible Gemini watermark on December 25. His post just said &#39;Merry Christmas! Wishing you a joyful holiday with friends and family,&#39; and the replies were overwhelmingly positive.&quot;Nothing ironic about it. Pichai&#39;s artwork has a watermark. He&#39;s being up-front that the image is AI generated and it&#39;s a product of his company. His holiday greeting is just another marketing message for Gemini and being posted that way by the CEO is totally on-brand.

If you are wondering if it is AI or not, then it cannot be that sloppy.Don&#39;t follow the terms 404media and other clickbait sites use. The neutral term is &quot;AI (generated) images&quot;

Pluribus is a starkly fitting show for this moment: a dystopic wish-fulfillment dark fantasy that allows the viewer to self-insert as a character who is the absolute center of the universe and simultaneously the victim of a unrestricted global conspiracy to undermine their sanity and agency.

I cannot think of a more perfect work in this modern moment to reflect the viewership.

Is it an AI trying to mimic human artistry, or a human artist trying to mimic AI&#39;s mimicry of human artistry?

Just because he hasn&#39;t seen them, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist. I distinctly remember various games on the sides of milk cartons. Like these:

Did he use Apple&#39;s AI technology, or did he use AI from some other company?

1. This is ironic because Pluribus is pretty much a critique of Ai.2. Someone at Apple actually promoting a show on their platform, but then doing it in the worst way possible.

Cool. Start with the guy all over the Epstein files.

FYI, you can be kidnapped by someone you know.

Some dogs are really stupid and others eat your face after you die.

But you are calling for &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;. And you do so with an incomplete picture of what happened. That makes you a problem. There is a reason these are illegal.

Sure, let&#39;s totally dispense justice based on mainstream media reporting of the alleged crime. No way that could go wrong!

The guy was protecting her from an alien invasion.  The aliens are clothing-mimicking creatures which when worn, take over a person&#39;s body.

Because I did not even hint at such a thing. All I said is the situation is unclear and that is the actual, factual truth. You basically requested torture, which is a thing no non-malicious person does. Abd you did it on incomplete information, which means you do not even care whether your cruelty is applied with some, however immoral, &quot;justification&quot;.

For fucks sake what makes a human so demented as to kidnap someone like that? Is it some kind of hate, or do they get overwhelmed with desire, that they dismiss and lose all empathy? Anyone who has a brain like that should suicide .. as there&#39;s likely no help for something like that .. not anytime soon anyway.

They&#39;re also rather rare compared to kidnapping by friends/family.

So yes this could have been an arranged meeting or something.

For fucks sake what makes a human so demented as to kidnap someone like that?
To be fair, the reason TFS references The Guardian and ABC News in Chicago is that the headlines in Texas papers simply said, &quot;Date Gone Wrong.&quot;  Sure, getting stuffed into a trunk is usually a weekend thing there, but it was a holiday.  Not sure about the at knife (or gun) point thing as everyone&#39;s armed in TX. /satire Is it some kind of hate, or do they get overwhelmed with desire, that they dismiss and lose all empathy?
Sadly, there are a myriad of reasons; perhaps the specifics in this case this will come out with further investigation.

Because in UK, a man was a parent doing what parents should do and tracked down and rescued his kidnapped daughter from a house where she was being held by a rape gang while police refused to do anything and then got arrested by same said police for assaulting one of the rapists during the rescue.

Can you link to the story? (I pasted your text into several search engines and there nothing obvious.)

Likely a complete hallucination. Some people have severe trouble separating their serialized fantasies from reality.

This accounting [gbnews.com] seems pretty close:

Jack knew his daughter was being exploited and desperately sought police support. He told GB News that he made hundreds of reports to South Yorkshire Police about her being missing.But instead of the force sufficiently investigating the issue, Jack claimed that they arrested him twice as he tried to rescue his daughter from the den.Doesn&#39;t mention directly assaulting the rapists so if it&#39;s what OP was referring to then he may have mixed up that detail with another story.But given these rape cover ups spanned decades and involved over a thousand cases it&#39;s hard to say certainly if it&#39;s not just another case.

So cops being lazy isn&#39;t just an American problem.

Yes and so they should. Taking matters into their own hands is a great way to get yourself killed. Very few people have a &quot;particular set of skills&quot;. Someone is going to copy this idiot and end up getting shot in the face.

According to TFS, the abduction was witnessed and those people immediately called the cops when it happened.

Witnesses at the scene of the abduction provided a detailed description of a vehicle involved in the kidnapping and of its driver, leading deputies to identify 23-year-old Giovanni Rosales Espinoza as a suspect, according to the sheriff’s office.

Very likely somebody she had a relationship of some kind. Things like this are exceptionally rare and almost unheard of by strangers, as can be seen by how this blows up in international (!) news. Hence, don&#39;t worry about something linke this happening. You daughter is far, far more likely to get severely injured or die in a car crash. But that will not make the news.

It used to be rare before so many illegally resident criminals were dumped in our country by Venezuela and others. They emptied their jails at us- now this shit happens.

Completely disconnected nonsense. It was exceptionally rare, is exceptionally rare and will remain exceptionally rare. And the ones dumping criminals on other places is the US, not the other way round.

What you have there is an instance of the &quot;Big Lie&quot; approach: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

No, asshole: children cannot consent to be raped by adults. It&#39;s rape, by definition. Don&#39;t be an asshole. And don&#39;t rape children. This isn&#39;t difficult.

Lethal force is legal in Texas for this sort of event...To prevent or end a kidnapping, lethal force is legal in pretty much every state, though there is some variation in the burden of proof.  To take revenge on a kidnapper once the girl is free, lethal force is not legal in any state, not even Texas.

Contrary to popular belief, Texas is a pretty middle of the road state with respect to legality of lethal force.  It has more restrictive concealed carry license requirements than many states, and more restrictions on where you can carry than many states.  Texas

I think the point was some kids walk home from school.  Though banning phones in classrooms and allowing them in lockers would let kids walk to/from school with them.

Kidnapper lucky Dad didn&#39;t have a gun.Dad lucky kidnapper didn&#39;t have one.

Note to self:  If loved one is kidnapped and I know where they are, tell the cops and let them handle it.  They are trained in how not to get killed and their aim is better than mine.

Or like this situation, where the cops killed the kidnapped girl they were trying to rescue. Great job guys!https://www.bbc.com/news/world... [bbc.com]

If it came down to &quot;the perp is going to escape with the girl, unless I risk my life&quot; .. what choice do you think the cop is making? I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t invite them .. invite them .. but make sure you&#39;re there too. Just in case you get ex Uvalde or Bondi beach cops.

It&#39;s Texas.  Dad probably did have a gun, and may have used it to secure his daughter&#39;s safety.

Yeah but would you risk tracking your daughter down alone without packing heat? You&#39;d want to be armed.

Only Trump-followers think that immigrants are more likely criminals than US citizens. And don&#39;t give me the crap about &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants. Trump has done everything in his power to make ALL immigrants illegal, including refugees and asylum seekers.

During his first year back in office, President Donald Trump amassed an unprecedented amount of power in pursuit of his far-reaching agenda. His quests to crush the Democratic Party’s electoral power, seize control over the economy, and deport millions of immigrants were all actively abetted by the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices. Time and again—often over the shadow docket, with no explanation—the 6–3 supermajority cleared the path for Trump’s aggressive executive overreach. Those who believed that SCOTUS might serve as a modest check on the administration’s abuses were proved wrong almost weekly, as the court’s far-right bloc delivered win after win to the president it had helped return to the White House. The justices’ rare rebuke to Trump on Tuesday over his deployment of the National Guard in Chicago illustrated just how far outside the law this president must go before a majority is willing to tell him no.

On this week’s year-end episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern ponder the two big questions posed by this alliance: Why did the Supreme Court conservative supermajority align with Trump, and what consequences might it face for its choices? A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A year ago, we were operating under the theory that three of the six conservative justices were not all in for MAGA and genuinely cared about democracy. That was a mistake. Instead, what we have seen is the so-called center go all in for Trump, doubling and tripling down on the idea that this administration is like every other administration and any judge who tries to thwart it is a woke liberal—including fistfuls of Trump judges who aren’t auditioning for the Supreme Court. And just as the Supreme Court went after DOJ officials during Jack Smith’s prosecution of Donald Trump, it’s now going after judges who stand in the president’s way, suggesting that they are anti-Trump zealots suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome,” while we the justices are normal and must put a stop to it.

Why? It’s hard to believe that they go to cocktail parties with only the furthest of the far-right donors. It’s hard to believe that they don’t occasionally read the Washington Post or the New York Times. So what is going on? And this is the real thing I think we haven’t grappled with, but I’m not sure people who are watching the court have yet satisfactorily explained it, at least to my ears. What possible benefit is there to being the stewards of the MAGA destruction of America?

Mark Joseph Stern: My top-line thesis—and I want you to dispute it, because I don’t know if it’s entirely right—is that these justices have fully cast their lot with Trump and Trumpism. And a big part of Trumpism is antidemocratic, ensuring that political minorities can entrench their own power through undemocratic institutions like the Senate, the Electoral College, and the judiciary, as well as through voter suppression and assaults on democracy. Trumpism seeks to perpetuate a system that privileges the elites, the wealthy, white people, Christians, non-LGBTQ+ people. And I fear that the Supreme Court is now intertwined with that perception of who deserves power and who can legitimately exercise power—which is Trump and his GOP and their supporters. So it fills the need to protect Trump’s entire project from the direct forces of actual democracy.

That’s why one of the big pieces of this puzzle is voting rights. The Supreme Court is currently on the brink of delivering another blow to the Voting Rights Act in Callais v. Louisiana. It has been green-lighting voter suppression for so long. Just this month it reinstated Texas’ racial gerrymander that benefits Republicans. Any conversation of this kind needs to start there, because what we are seeing is the court trying to accelerate and facilitate the Trump agenda—and, on the other side of it, trying to ensure that the people can no longer shake loose this regime or really do anything to stop it and reverse what it has done, because there’s only one true way. It’s originalism and Trumpism, which are increasingly the same thing. And anyone who contests that is wielding an illegitimate claim to power. That justifies taking away voting rights and equal representation and democracy and whatever is necessary to ensure that what the regime’s doing now can just keep going forever.

When I started doing these New Year’s shows, it really struck me that we get absolutely caught up in individual big-ticket cases that weigh toward Trump and the culture wars, without looking at all the cases in the aggregate. When you’re covering the court, it is very easy to think, in the moment: The only case that matters is tariffs. Or transgender athletes. Or birthright citizenship. And, to be sure, every one of those cases is a blockbuster. But if you look at the big themes this year, you’re exactly right: It’s the voting cases. There are a lot of voting cases on the docket. We’ve talked about Callais and Texas’ gerrymander. There’s also campaign finance, plus a major case about mail ballots that the court will hear this term.

I think we really need to see the trend line, which is: The Supreme Court now has six votes to do anything it wants. And it is constantly taking cases about how people vote, where people vote, how their votes are counted, how campaigns are financed. While the big-ticket cases with huge social justice and racial justice implications do matter, it’s the democracy cases that have the biggest impact. We’re barreling into the midterms, and the 2028 election after that. And the way for the Supreme Court to achieve all the big-ticket items it wants is to make sure that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have a permanent majority.

By the way, these democracy cases don’t always get treated as seriously in the public conversation. They can be arcane; explaining campaign finance is a two-bourbon job right now. These are abstractions, and they can get devalued in the discourse. But we have to reckon with the fact that if you are a six-justice supermajority and you want to make sure you can do all the stuff you want to do for the next 10 or 20 years, you need to ensure that nothing will stop you, not even an election.

I do want to add that the birthright citizenship case, while absolutely a social justice issue, is also a democracy case. It’s about who counts as an American. And if the Trump administration gets its way, it would radically reduce the number of people who have a constitutional claim to birthright citizenship and are therefore able to participate in basic aspects of civic life. And that’s a theme that sounds in a lot of these other cases: Who gets to be a full and equal American citizen, and who gets something more like skim-milk citizenship? You see it in democracy cases and civil rights cases alike: Straight white men get the highest form of American citizenship. They can’t stop winning, while everybody else is losing.

That really does lead me to this stakes question, because we ask all the time on this show: What are the stakes for women? For LGBTQ+ communities? For immigrants? But I want to ask the question: What are the stakes for the Supreme Court? Because it seems to me we don’t think nearly hard enough about what is on the line for those six MAGA justices if they don’t shrink democracy enough to change electoral outcomes.

I think they have reached a point of no return, and they are scared of what happens if the political winds switch direction. At least some of them must understand that they have failed to act as independent jurists. In the mind of a majority of Americans, they are a political body, and as I said, they have cast their lot with Trumpism. If they had spent the past year truly standing up to Trump from time to time, I don’t think they’d have as much to fear from Republicans losing political power. I doubt there would be as much Democratic appetite for Supreme Court reform, including term limits and court expansion.

The Republican-appointed justices could have played this smarter if their goal was to stave off Democratic backlash. Giving Trump just 25 percent more losses would have given a lot of people the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the court was more or less doing its job. Americans want to see one branch stand in the way of another when it looks like there is an abuse of power. At this point, though, the justices have gone too far down this road to turn around. And they should be worried, because there is a very real chance that the entire Trumpist project will fall apart. And they are now so intertwined with Trumpism that they might collapse with it. That’s why it is so important for them to weaponize these democracy cases. There may come a time when the only way they can maintain their grasp on power is to oppress the majority.

Over the past calendar year, the Supreme Court’s center has shifted to the right and then more to the right, and the justices’ decisions have time and again facilitated Trump’s agenda. But the Roberts majority is not simply focused on what the current president wants; it has its sights set on a larger project: voting. Suppressing and constraining and problematizing the core function of democratic rule.

In this episode, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern reflect on the significant developments at the Supreme Court over the past year with an eye toward the implications of the court’s decisions on democracy, voting rights, and the erosion of checks and balances. Looking back at the past year at One First Street, Dahlia and Mark trace the cases that reveal the court’s long game, with elections coming quickly, and discuss the forces for and against democracy being exerted within and without the high court. Then, they turn to the urgent matter of what you and I can do about it.

On Nov. 17, Abdallah Hadian, a civilian imam, strode into a state correctional facility in New York with a firearm. Moments later, he went into the administration building and placed the gun to his head.

Word of the 55-year-old imam’s suicide traveled nearly as quickly as the bullet that took his life.

In prison, no one bats an eye at hearing that an inmate killed themselves. This is especially true among fellow prisoners. Hearing that a fellow prisoner was stabbed to death, or overdosed, elicits a shrug, maybe a nervous laugh. Although we attribute such incidents to the violent and miserable nature of the place we inhabit, most people on the outside chalk these deaths up to the so-called mental health crisis inside correctional facilities, a phenomenon that gets significant attention. It adds to the unfair narrative of prisoners being bloodthirsty lunatics, a framing that benefits tough-on-crime politics.

As a prisoner, though, when you hear that a civilian staff member who left their family every day to go to the awful confines of prison—the same prison where Robert Brooks was murdered—took their own life in such a shocking fashion, it makes you wonder what we’re doing wrong. More importantly, the question swings in the air: What might someone who is living in the free world but considering killing themselves learn from prisoners about hanging on?

I’ve been there. I’m serving my 16th year for manslaughter. In 2009 a drunken argument with my girlfriend devolved into a physical altercation with deadly weapons. She stabbed me, I stabbed her, she died. I immediately attempted to end it all.

Obviously, I didn’t succeed. In the hospital, I soldiered through the physical misery of a collapsed lung. Then I wrestled with the shame and guilt of killing someone that I had loved, emotions that were all the more amplified when I was forced to relive the trauma in court. I’d be lying if I told you that I hadn’t contemplated every means of suicide.

I believe that I Iived through that awful and tragic experience to be held accountable, not only by the victim’s family but, less sympathetically, to the mirror. The pressures of life, which in that moment felt unbearable, proved bearable.

In my role as a journalist, I found purpose and draw from that dark place when reporting stories about characters who have their own dark encounters. I think it has enabled me to develop as a writer who draws out the humanity of prisoners that the tabloids leave behind. In interviewing the subjects of my stories, I always find myself threading our shared experiences into narratives pegged to universal themes like parenting, drug use, and—for obvious reasons a reoccurring motif—the feeling of the walls closing in. But the experience of isolation in prison is not monolithic.

Like most of the prisons I’ve had the displeasure of living in, Eastern NY Correctional Facility during the “happiest time of the year” offers no gifts under a Christmas tree. No “Happy Holidays” decorations. Just yellowed suicide-prevention memorandums posted on the bulletin board. Guys live here under the weight of life sentences and have been away from their families and loved ones for decades. Other guys haven’t gotten visits in years but still find reasons to wake up, to put both feet on the ground, and, oddly enough, even to smile.

I can’t help but admire the resiliency of old-timers, some of whom have lost every family member, who have more time in prison than I have on this earth. They keep it simple, play Scrabble or spades and talk shit. Once able-bodied men, they walk with canes, one step at a time.

It is the coping mechanisms of the prisoner, our survival under this added layer of extreme inhumanity, that may make us the most apt case studies for suicide prevention.

One day this season, I overheard some of the GED students inside our school building tell the prison’s acting educational supervisor, Nicole Cooke, that they didn’t have anything to be grateful for during the holidays.

“I didn’t like that,” she told me from behind a large wooden desk. This gave her an idea.

She had a tree painted on the wall, leaving the branches bare. Photocopied drawings of jars containing the words I’m thankful for were distributed to everyone who wanted to decorate the tree. She told guys to write what they were grateful for inside the paper jars, which stood in for the tree’s leaves.

Although the gratitude tree remained on the wall for about a month, as I attended my classes I walked right past it without reading a single jar.

The same day that I went inside the school building to finally put my own note on the gratitude tree, the jars had been taken down. I spoke with Cooke, and she removed them from her drawer and handed me the stack of paper jars. I sat down alone in the academic library and counted 82 altogether. I plucked through them one by one, reading their contents. Forty-six of them contained the word family or mi familia. Some included only a word or two, like mom or even Ms. Cooke. Suddenly, I realized that in my hands these small pieces of paper weighing next to nothing contained something so heavy and intimate—people and things that gave my community a sense of hope and purpose, reasons for living. I felt a little wrong riffling through them, but I was inspired to witness a collective will to live. As Albert Camus said, “Rarely is suicide committed through reflection.”

That’s when I noticed that a handful of these jars had been filled out by staff, people who, like Hadian, the imam, get to go home every day. Their end-of-year reflections had been displayed side by side with the prisoners’ jars on the tree: a shared message of thankfulness and hope displayed for everyone who took part or who bothered to look.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus is another entry in our occasional “Dear (Juris)Prudence” series, in which we invite listeners to ask their burning questions about the law and answer them as best we can. Write to amicus@slate.com to pose a question to Dahlia and Mark. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dear (Juris)Prudence,What does recovery look like for us as a nation? Even if we elect a Democratic president, House, and Senate in 2028, how can we legislate or otherwise repair the damage to the law, norms, precedent, etc., when we still have a Supreme Court that ignores law, norms, precedent, and maybe even the 14th Amendment?

Dahlia Lithwick: This is really an existential question as much as a legal one, but I know you’ve given it some thought.

Mark Joseph Stern: I think anyone who cares about salvaging American democracy needs to be asking those exact questions. And it’s pretty clear to me that the very first item on the agenda needs to be envisioning what the next Democratic president—let’s say, President AOC—should do in the first 24 hours of their time in office. That means embracing the maximalist vision of executive power that Trump has established to undo the damage that he is currently inflicting. Trump has amassed vast new powers for the president, and the next Democrat in the White House simply cannot surrender them. That would be unilateral disarmament, and a disservice to the country. What he or she needs to do instead is wield those powers aggressively for good, repair everything that’s broken, help the people Trump has hurt, and push forward with their own goals.

How does that cash out? First, let’s remember that the Supreme Court has now effectively granted the president authority to impound federal funds duly appropriated by Congress and to abolish federal agencies established and funded by Congress. I think that is terrible and anti-constitutional. But thanks to the Supreme Court, that is now the law. So let’s talk about what President AOC can do with those powers in 2029. On Day 1, she needs to impound ICE’s budget. She needs to refuse to spend the billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated to the agency and fire tens of thousands of immigration agents immediately, starting with those who committed acts of violence and discrimination—which, by that point, may be almost all of them. Close as many immigrant detention facilities as possible and free the detainees.

Then turn to Customs and Border Protection. Fire CBP chief Greg Bovino. Fire every single agent who participated in the horrific operations in Chicago, D.C., and L.A. Refuse to pay out a penny in benefits to any agent who broke the law. Release all the information about ICE and CBP’s immigration sweeps, including the names of every agent who participated. Start investigations and prosecutions of any law-breaking agent whom Trump doesn’t pardon. Repurpose the billions of dollars in savings as a reparations fund for every victim. Run the reparations program through a new agency established by executive order. Pay to return noncitizens who were wrongly deported back to the country. Transform ICE and CBP’s headquarters into the nerve center of a new Truth and Reconciliation Agency, and use this extra money to pay out damages to the victims of the mass deportation campaign. This would be 100 percent legal under the precedent established by Trump and the Supreme Court.

Remember: Trump has illegally fired tens of thousands of civil servants, closed agencies like USAID unilaterally, refused to pay out billions of dollars appropriated by Congress, halted our refugee program, shuttered the Education Department, paid reparations to Jan. 6 defendants and quite possibly himself. I think all of that should be illegal, but the Supreme Court has said that it is not. And you just cannot fight fire with a dripping faucet. So I say: Take these powers and use them to undo Trump’s legacy and really flood the zone. Blitz the country with these executive orders on Day 1 and dare anybody to stop you.

At the same time, the next Democratic president is going to be a “unitary executive” thanks to the Supreme Court. So purge every federal agency of Trump holdovers. Start with the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, every other formerly independent agency. Oust every single Trump appointee at any agency in the executive branch. The Supreme Court is about to let the president do that, and it needs to see the consequences of its actions when the president isn’t named Donald Trump. Take his name off the Kennedy Center, the Institute of Peace, and every other institution that he has illegally branded. This needs to be a top-to-bottom reconstruction of the executive branch using the precedents that Trump himself established. That is the only way a true recovery can begin, and that is what needs to happen within 24 hours of the next Democrat reentering the White House.

I want to hurl myself in front of one objection you’re going to get, which is: But then the Supreme Court’s going to say all of that is illegal! My response is: Good, that’ll take three years to litigate. Run out the clock in the million ways that we have learned that the clock can be run out. And if everything is enjoined on Day 1 by every single Trump judge and then the Supreme Court, then we have another conversation. But I absolutely agree: Democrats should not petition, hands outstretched to the Supreme Court, for the maximalist version of presidential power when it’s not Donald Trump in office. They need to say: Cool, this is what the rule is now. Let’s go.

The other thing I want to say is that baked into Jacob’s question is this issue of: How do we reinstate norms? How do we get the other side to abide by the entire complicated web of unenforceable feelings about, say, a separation between the Justice Department and the White House? And how prosecutors conduct themselves in court? And on and on? If we can learn any lesson from President Joseph Biden’s regime, it’s that you cannot simply adhere to norms and hope the other side will look around and say: Hey, I forgot—norms are awesome! That is not the way to go back to living under soft, unenforceable norms of democracy. You cannot bring a shrimp fork to a knife fight. We have to disabuse ourselves of that idea.

Because norms survive in a system like ours when both sides feel that they have something to gain from them and something to lose when they go away. And right now, under Trump, the Republican Party believes that it can only gain from shattering norms, because Democrats are too timid and afraid of their own shadow. And the only way to disabuse the GOP of that notion is to show them what happens to their side when the norms are gone. We cannot restore the norms magically by having one side abide by them. That would only make things worse by reiterating to the Republican Party that it might as well shatter any norms it wants because Democrats will just go back to abiding by them, even when they constrict the political fortunes and the power of Democratic lawmakers. It can’t work that way. It can only work if Democrats give Republicans a taste of their own medicine and remind them why the norms were there in the first place.

I often say that norms are not an end in themselves. Norms are a means to a larger end, which is a functioning democratic state. And the notion that we can rebuild a world of norms unilaterally is the enduring failure of the Biden administration.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">IBM has announced the death of its former CEO Lou Gerstner, who passed away on Saturday, aged 83.

In his biography, “Who Says Elephants Can&#39;t Dance?” Gerstner recounted his middle-class upbringing and time at Dartmouth University and Harvard Business School. At 23, he went to work for management consultancy McKinsey and within nine years became a senior partner before taking a senior role at American Express.

During his 11 years at American Express, Gerstner had his first encounter with IBM when one of the divisions he oversaw adopted computers from Amdahl in addition to its Big Blue mainframes. IBM threatened to withdraw support for its hardware. Gerstner tried to contact IBM’s CEO, only to be met with bureaucratic indifference despite American Express being a very significant customer at the time.

“Cooler heads prevailed at IBM and the incident passed,” he wrote. “Nevertheless, it did not go out of my memory.”

Gerstner next became CEO of RJR Nabisco, a chastening experience as its new venture capitalist owners demanded performance the business was not set up to deliver. After four years in the job, he began to contemplate his next move. IBM’s leadership was the subject of speculation at the time, and Johnson & Johnson CEO Jim Burke reached out to Gerstner and suggested he express interest in the job.

The idea appealed and Gerstner engaged with IBM, but after seeing the state of its books and product strategy, he decided not to seek the role.

Burke persisted and told Gerstner “You owe it to America to take the job.” He and others convinced Gerstner that his work at American Express meant he had the experience to reform IBM, and that his approach of focusing on business fundamentals – strong cashflow and focusing on customers’ needs – would be applicable.

Gerstner decided IBM was a great challenge, took the job, and started work in April 1993.

The New York Times reported his appointment with the headline “Task of Turning Around I.B.M. Is Given to an Industry Outsider.”

In a letter sent to IBM staff and posted online, current IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wrote that Gerstner “arrived at IBM at a moment when the company’s future was genuinely uncertain.”

“The industry was changing rapidly, our business was under pressure, and there was serious debate about whether IBM should even remain whole,” Krishna wrote. “His leadership during that period reshaped the company. Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.”

“One of Lou’s earliest signals as CEO has become part of IBM lore. Early on, he stopped a long internal presentation and said, simply, ‘Let’s just talk.’ The message was clear: less inward focus, more real discussion, and much closer attention to customers. That mindset would define his tenure.”

Krishna said Gerstner believed IBM “had lost sight of a basic truth of business: understanding the customer and delivering what the customer actually values,” and changed that attitude.

“Meetings became more direct. Decisions were grounded more in facts and client impact than in hierarchy or tradition. Innovation mattered if it could translate into something clients would come to rely on. Execution in the quarter and the year mattered, but always in service of longer-term relevance.”

Gerstner also made many more IBM staff eligible to earn stock options, decided to integrate IBM’s siloed business units, and created its first services and consulting operations that offered business strategy and worked with technologies beyond Big Blue’s own stack. That business, IBM Global Services, became a powerhouse. He also embraced openness, allowing IBM software to run on third-party platforms and rival software vendors to code for Big Blue’s boxes.

He expressed those strategies through acquisitions such as the 1995 deal to buy Lotus for $3.5 billion – then the biggest-ever software deal – and the $743 million purchase of Tivoli in 1996. Buying Lotus gave IBM an entry into the emerging market for custom networked applications running on PCs. Tivoli gave its consulting arm tools to manage diverse IT estates.

Gerstner’s acquisitions and strategies changed IBM’s culture and helped it surf the mid-1990s wave of internet adoption to grow revenue by around $20 billion a year on Gerstner’s watch. The company also enjoyed strong share price growth.

But the CEO didn’t believe in internet hype.

In the year 2000, The Register obtained an internal IBM memo in which Gerstner explained that he bet the company on e-business, which he believed was “changing the entire basis of the global economy.”

Gerstner observed the sky-high valuations of early internet companies, the CEOs replicating their strategies, and dismissed it as “dot-com alchemy.”

“How long it will continue, or why it is so often unreasoned, I wouldn&#39;t venture to say,” he wrote in the memo. “But I&#39;m certain that is not the game for most CEOs – whether their companies are smokestacks or dot-coms. For us, the game is to do the hard work of accelerating the transformation of our fundamentals – to understand that the Net isn&#39;t really about short-term stock performance but long-term stock and business performance.”

“Of course, not all companies have been seduced by the lure of the magic market-cap wand. Many are hard at work creating alternate distribution channels, reinventing – not just spinning off – their supply chains, and more. This is a period of extraordinary change, with extraordinary opportunities. But we can&#39;t seize them through dot-com alchemy.”

When Gerstner left IBM in 2002, it was in better shape than he found it. He even earned an honorary knighthood.

There were casualties: Gerstner presided over tens of thousands of job cuts. The CEO misread consumer and business enthusiasm for PCs, allowing Compaq and Dell to overtake the market it pioneered, and Microsoft to dominate the market for PC operating systems to the extent that IBM gave up on OS/2. Those decisions gave Microsoft and Dell an entry to enterprise computing that both have used to surpass IBM’s revenue and influence. IBM also lost leadership in networking, storage, processor design, and saw x86 servers drive its mainframe and midrange business into niche markets.

After leaving IBM, Gerstner focused on philanthropy, especially regarding education, and serving on boards. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Korean e-tailer Coupang claims a former employee has admitted to improperly accessing data describing 33 million of its customers, but says the accused deleted the stolen data.

In a post published on Christmas, Coupang revealed it worked with Mandiant, Palo Alto Networks, and Ernst & Young, to conduct a forensic investigation into the incident, and has also secured sworn statements from the alleged perpetrator.

The investigation and testimony mean Coupang believes the perpetrator stole a security key while working at the company and later used it to access customer records.

According to Coupang’s report, the alleged perp looked up “roughly 3,000” customers’ order histories and building access codes, a data point used so delivery workers can place packages inside apartment blocks.

Investigators found the alleged perp accessed the data using a PC and a MacBook Air. The accused surrendered the PC, and investigators found the script used to run the attack on one of its hard drives.

After media reported the attack, the accused decided to destroy evidence of his activity, and therefore smashed his MacBook Air, stuffed it in a Coupang canvas bag along with some bricks, and threw it into a river.

An aside: In 2011, before joining The Register, your correspondent wrote a story about data recovery and spoke to a forensics expert who advised using salt water to destroy evidence because it does more damage to electronics than fresh water. That story may have been useful to the accused because after he revealed his actions, investigators found the laptop in the river and were able to read its serial number – which matched the serial number of the accused’s iCloud account.

Coupang’s post says the alleged perpetrator “only” retained data describing roughly 3,000 accounts, never moved it off his PC and MacBook Air, and deleted it all after seeing news reports about his actions.

“The investigative findings to date are consistent with the perpetrator’s sworn statements and found no evidence that contradicts these statements,” Coupang’s post states.

Coupang’s account of the incident suggests its impact was relatively limited, a welcome assertion as South Korea’s population is around 52 million – meaning the attack affected more than half of the nation’s residents.

Coupang remains in a world of pain. On Monday the company announced that it will gift 33 million customers whose data the alleged perp accessed a ₩50,000 ($35) voucher, an effort that will cost it $1.17 billion. South Korea’s government has commissioned an inquiry into the company’s operations, which – if the data leak at Korean carrier SK Telecom is a precedent – will result in substantial fines. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration on Saturday posted draft rules governing the behaviour of AI companions that prohibit using them to serve as friends for the elderly.

The draft “Interim Measures for the Administration of Humanized Interactive Services Based on Artificial Intelligence” opens with a suggestion that China needs regulations to ensure the healthy development of AIs that “engage in emotional interaction with humans.”

As is always the case with China’s tech regulations, the draft calls for providers of companion AIs to ensure they are secure, don’t expose users to fraud, encrypt data, and reflect core socialist values. It also includes a requirement for parental controls, and for protection of data that describes minors.

One Article in the draft addresses how AI companions interact with the elderly:

Providers shall guide elderly people to set up emergency contact persons for their services. If any elderly person is found to be in danger of losing their life, health or property during the use of the service, the provider shall promptly notify the emergency contact person and provide social and psychological assistance or emergency relief channels.

Providers are prohibited from providing services that simulate the relatives or specific relationships of elderly users.

The draft also calls for AI companions to remind users they are not interacting with a human every two hours, and for providers of such systems to provide advance notice of outages.

Also among the draft requirements are calls for “mental health protection, emotional boundary guidance, and dependency risk warning, and should not use replacing social interaction, controlling users&#39; psychology, or inducing addiction as design goals.”

The draft also prohibits using data gathered during interaction with AI companies to train models.

The Cyberspace Administration wants feedback on the draft by January 25th.

Australia’s Department of Defence has tapped Google for an “enhanced, secure and air-gapped hyperscale cloud capability.”

“Defence will have access to advanced global cloud solutions to deliver key sovereign capabilities,” states the department’s announcement of the deal. “The technology will support faster rollout of critical systems, ongoing upgrades and improved cooperation with international partners, while ensuring Australia retains control of critical Defence assets.”

Australia’s government already has a deal with AWS to operate three datacenters dedicated to government workloads, including information rated as the nation’s “most classified data.”

The Department said the sensitivities of the Google deal mean it will “refrain from providing further commentary … with all specific details remaining strictly confidential.”

Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has published its initial analysis of the failed launch of its H3 rocket last week.

The agency found that when the rocket’s fairing separated, pressure in a fuel tank fell. When the engine that used the fuel tank ignited, it produced around 80 percent of expected pressure.

The rocket’s second stage and payload therefore could not reach the intended orbit. The report suggests both fell into Earth’s atmosphere and burned up safely.

57 percent of components present in Huawei smartphones are now made in China, according to a product teardown reported by Japanese outlet Nikkei.

Working with Japanese teardown service Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, Nikkei analyzed the content of 2024’s Mate 70 Pro and this year’s Pura 80 Pro, and found 57 percent of components in both were made in China, and that those parts accounted for 60 percent of the phone’s value.

Nikkei reports that just 19 percent of components in Huawei’s 2020 models came from China, rising to 32 percent in 2023.

Papua New Guinea’s (PNG’s) National Information & Communications Technology Authority has warned signatories to a petition calling for Starlink to be licensed for operations in the country that they risk prosecution.

PNG is a rugged country with poor telecommunications infrastructure – a fine fit for Starlink’s satellite broadband service. Local netizens have campaigned for PNG to license Starlink, suggesting they email NICTA to express support for Starlink.

On December 16th NICTA demanded Starlink suspend services to the country.

On Christmas Eve, NICTA published a list of petitioners and warned “Individuals who have signed or participated in the petition may be regarded as potential offenders, and NICTA will not hesitate to pursue appropriate regulatory and legal action where non-compliance is established.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The knock-on, and often unintentional, impacts of a cyberattack are so rarely discussed. As an industry, the focus is almost always placed on the economic damage: the ransom payment; the cost of business downtime; and goodness, don&#39;t forget those poor shareholders.

But, in recent years, the toll on human life has become increasingly apparent.

We know the poor sods working in the security operations center give up their weekends every time a phish slips through the net, and we know how hard corporate spin doctors have to work on controlling post-attack narratives. However, there is a sense that the real harms affecting real people, most of whom don&#39;t realize how their lives could change because of a cybercriminal&#39;s thirst for chaos, or cash, are increasingly central to the telling of a modern cybercrime story.

Attacks over the past year were not the first to affect human life, but the sheer volume of them makes 2025 worth a revisit, starting with the most tragic of all.

Yes, Qilin&#39;s ransomware attack on Synnovis, a pathology services provider to major London hospitals, took place in 2024. And yes, The Register exclusively reported on the devastating human cost of the attack at the time, too.

But, earlier this year, King&#39;s College Hospital NHS Trust – one of the hospitals affected by the blood shortages – confirmed that a patient died during the period of service disruption caused by the cyberattack.

It is still believed to be the first confirmed case of a ransomware-related death.

Others have been discussed in previous years, including a 2020 attack on a Düsseldorf hospital, and claims from the University of Minnesota&#39;s School of Public Health, which estimated between 42 and 67 US Medicare patients may have died as a result of ransomware.

The attack on Synnovis, however, is the only confirmed direct link between cybercrime and death, which is why it makes this list. Despite occurring in 2024, the link was officially established this year, so it makes the cut.

In recent years, we&#39;ve seen ransomware crooks leak cancer patients&#39; medical imagery, and hit institutions from charities to children&#39;s hospitals, but this year&#39;s attack on Kido International reached lows never seen before.

Radiant Group posted the images of 10 schoolchildren online, complete with their home addresses, parents&#39; names, and guardians&#39; contact details.

In verifying the leaked data was genuine, The Register spoke to some of the affected children&#39;s parents, all of whom told of their fury over the attack and what the criminals did with the data.

Dray Agha, senior manager of security operations at Huntress, told us at the time: &quot;This represents a reprehensible erosion of any remaining boundaries in the cybercriminal ecosystem. By weaponizing the personal data of infants and toddlers, this group has sunk to a depth that even other threat actors may condemn.&quot;

He went on to say that the decision to publish the children&#39;s images and data was counterproductive; from a PR perspective, the way Radiant handled the disclosure would prevent victims from productively engaging with it.

Even for a ransomware gang, this was bad… so bad that rival operation Nova publicly shamed Radiant on the Russian cybercrime forum RAMP, peer pressuring it to remove the data.

The massively disruptive attack on Jaguar Land Rover is one of the worst to ever hit the UK, from an economic perspective.

The cost of its five-week shutdown, the associated recovery, and the missed payments to its huge supply chain, was pegged at more than £2 billion ($2.68 billion). It led to the UK government stepping in with a novel financial support package, and dented the UK&#39;s GDP growth at the back end of the year.

Companies across JLR&#39;s supply chain were affected too, as its factories were in no position to order parts due to the production shutdown. Reliant on their contracts with the major automaker, the Unite workers&#39; union said it was aware of layoffs across JLR&#39;s suppliers, which were struggling to stay afloat while the company restored its systems.

JLR itself made no redundancies throughout the ordeal, although its workers, most of whom were told to stay at home throughout the cleanup, and their families, lived in fear for their livelihoods.

The wife of one worker at JLR&#39;s Halewood facility said she feared the family not being able to afford food or presents at Christmas, while the parents of a young staffer in Solihull were concerned for their son&#39;s ability to afford rent after recently moving into his own property.

As cryptocurrency valuations grow ever loftier, so too do the ambitions of cybercriminals who will seemingly stop at very little to get their hands on it.

Security shop and infamous Falcon update fudger CrowdStrike said last month that it observed a &quot;dramatic&quot; increase in violence as a service activity across Europe.

Its report zeroed in on violent cryptocurrency thefts, which according to data it cited, have increased compared to 2024.

Violence as a service, as a genre of cybercrime, is not unique to 2025, nor is it solely tied to crypto thefts, although that specific intersection is the most common.

Avid Reg readers may remember our coverage of a high-profile case in the US from 2024 involving Remy Ra St Felix, head thug behind a spate of violent home invasions targeting crypto-wealthy Americans.

However, the upward trend of violent cybercrime has bled into 2025 and racked up a torrent of cases, ranging from extortion to full-on amputations.

Regarding the latter, arguably the most infamous example came in January when Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife, Amandine, were kidnapped by a 10-strong gang who then demanded a ransom (no -ware) from other Ledger execs.

Jameson Lopp, co-founder of crypto security biz Casa, publicly tracks violent crypto thefts, recording 67 for 2025 in total.

A warning to readers: You can peruse the stories Lopp tracks via his GitHub page, but some of the details are really not for the faint of heart.

Elsewhere, security researchers report ransomware crews are upping the ante with their attacks, increasingly resorting to threats of physical violence during the negotiation period.

A Semperis study from July found that around 40 percent of ransomware victims had received such threats, which Jeff Wichman, Semperis&#39; director of breach preparedness and response, said would likely increase over the coming year.

&quot;The threats of physical harm are pretty scary,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;I am afraid of what&#39;s next.&quot;

&quot;It was threats against their family members: what their [internet] surfing traffic was, what they did at home,&quot; Wichman said. &quot;The attackers know where the executives live, they know where their families are, they know where their kids go to school.&quot;

Most recently, Europol announced as part of its Operational Taskforce GRIMM that it arrested 193 suspects linked to crimes related to contract killings, intimidation, and torture. These typically involved grooming or coercing kids and teens to carry out the acts for cash.

The FBI recently warned about how emergency scams are evolving, with criminals now leveraging advanced deepfake technology to carry out virtual kidnappings.

Lowlifes take images from social media, run them through AI programs to depict the subject as if they are in danger, and send them to family members in the hope of receiving a ransom payment.

This is the typical model, although the feds warned that some criminals are even seeking out real missing person information posted online, and using that to craft their insidious campaigns.

While the FBI did not respond to our questions about the total number of cases it has observed in the past year, according to its figures, hundreds of emergency scams [PDF] were reported last year, in total costing victims around $2.7 million.

The proof-of-life images these criminals send to families can seem highly convincing at first glance, especially to those already in distress, but close inspection of these AI-doctored materials often reveals inaccuracies.

They will be told not to by the scammers, but victims should contact their local police forces if they receive these kinds of images. They have trained professionals equipped to handle these situations, who can discern a real from a fake.

Families should also avoid sharing information with strangers while travelling, the FBI said, and set a code word so that if any friend or loved one is genuinely kidnapped, they can reliably provide proof-of-life.

Death, torture, and amputations aside, when we think about cyberattacks, among the more concerning potential consequences is the impact they can have on critical infrastructure, such as emergency services.

Luckily, such events are rare. UK telcos BT and Three suffered an outage in July caused by a software issue, which prevented customers from calling emergency services, but cyberattacks almost never impact these services.

However, last month&#39;s attack on Crisis24, which provides the CodeRED emergency alert system to various US municipalities, resulted in citizens&#39; data being stolen and access to the alerts app temporarily revoked.

The OnSolve CodeRED platform provides users with rapid alerts for emergencies such as weather warnings, terror threats, and more. Authorities in the affected areas resorted to sharing the same notifications via their social media pages while they waited for CodeRED to come back online.

No crises took place during the period of downtime, fortunately, although the attack demonstrates how a ransomware gang could have unintentionally caused intense chaos across various communities. ®

            <div id="article-text">BORK!BORK!BORK! Today&#39;s bork belongs in the dim and distant past – a reminder of when Windows had proper crash screens.

Snapped by an eagle-eyed Register reader, this traditional Windows Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) was found in the delightful Spanish city of Seville.

The five-star Barceló Sevilla Renacimiento hotel is notable for its imposing curved walls and &quot;an architectural design reminiscent of the Guggenheim in New York.&quot; Readers would therefore be forgiven for thinking that no euros would be spared when it comes to the signage.

Alas, this is not the case as far as whatever is driving these screens is concerned. Part of the hotel is a conference space, and the &quot;What&#39;s On&quot; display is either very unhappy, or an early version of Microsoft Windows (perhaps Windows 7?) is telling visitors that the only upcoming event is a safe boot to stop the operating system choking.

The code 0x00000024 suggests something has happened on the disk. Tapping F8 during startup should permit a chkdsk to hunt out corruption. Alternatively, it could be a driver doing something naughty in the kernel following an update, thus stirring memories of 2024&#39;s CrowdStrike incident, in which a faulty update file from the company unleashed mayhem on Windows devices around the world.

The &quot;classic&quot; Blue Screen of Death has become a rarity in recent years, not because Windows is any more reliable, but because Microsoft updated it with a sad emoticon to indicate that something has gone wrong.

However, it is a delight to see the old warhorse every now and again, assuming that the Barceló Sevilla Renacimiento conference center is not plugging a day of sessions on how to deal with obscure and unhelpful error codes. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Today&#39;s Christmas bork comes from London&#39;s Victoria train station, just before the festive season got underway, and is an update to the old IT standby: &quot;It isn&#39;t DNS. It can&#39;t be DNS... It was SSL.&quot;

In this case, the victim is one of the digital advertising screens so beloved of public spaces these days. Rather than having a human paste up posters regularly, these things allow seamless content updates to delight passing travelers until, of course, the bork fairy pays a visit.

This example of the fairy&#39;s evil work can be found at one of the station&#39;s entrances and is both an example of an unhappy update and the infamous Progress Bar of Lies.

To our uneducated eye, the screen appears to be running a version of Android. The wheels have come off during an update, possibly due to an issue in an SSL library. The message also references BoringSSL, Google&#39;s fork of OpenSSL tweaked for the ad slinger&#39;s needs and &quot;not intended for general use.&quot;

A hopeful progress bar is visible, but all is not well within the signage. It&#39;s probably not a touchscreen, so prodding the &quot;Update Immediately&quot; and &quot;Browse Update File&quot; buttons is unlikely to help.

With luck, a tired administrator will be notified that passengers are not being shown ads and will resolve the problem remotely. Or at least rotate the screen so that tired, emotional customers do not inadvertently topple over while trying to read the text.

Still, while a Progress Bar of Lies might be on display here, it&#39;s a step up from what lies beyond, where Victoria train station has what can only be described as a Departure Board of Optimism. Here, SSL means something quite different – Signals, Staff shortages, and Leaves – in the canon of UK transportation bork. ®

The three flagships under the new branding are the 39GX950B, the 27GM950B, and the 52G930B. The first number in the model name indicates the size. The rest of the letters and numbers, well, I’m sure they mean something to someone.

The 39-inch GX9 is an ultrawide 21:9 5K2K dual-mode OLED screen. It can run at its full resolution at 165Hz, or jump to 330Hz for fast-twitch games at WFHD. The 27-inch GM9 uses “New” MiniLEDs, which promise to deliver brighter images compared to OLED, without the blooming often associated with MiniLEDs. Lastly, the 52-inch G9 is an absolutely massive curved display that delivers a 12:9 panoramic view at 240Hz in its native 5K2K resolution.

The GM9 model is particularly interesting since LG makes the panels for Apple’s Pro Display XDR, and word is that the monitor is finally getting a long-overdue update in the near future.

All three monitors will be on display at CES next month, but there’s no word on pricing or availability just yet.

The Shirley Jackson Award-winning book from Victor LaValle is an anti-racist take on Lovecraft.

Things that HP Lovecraft was good at: Creating a mythos. Building atmosphere.

Things that HP Lovecraft was bad at: Writing dialog. Creating compelling characters. Not being a racist.

As a fan of horror in general, I can’t pretend that Lovecraft isn’t an important touchstone. But the man’s blatant racism is also impossible to ignore, especially since it often finds its way onto the pages of his stories. One of the most notorious is The Horror at Red Hook, which follows Detective Thomas Malone as he uncovers a sinister cult in the titular Brooklyn neighborhood.

The Ballad of Black Tom is a retelling of that story, but from the perspective of Charles “Tommy” Tester, a black man from Harlem who finds himself inadvertently stuck in the middle of one man’s quest for power and the police. The author, Victor LaValle, flips the explicitly xenophobic original, turning it into a commentary on police brutality, racism, and the psychological effects of living as an oppressed person. Lovecraft would have hated it.

Tommy is a hustler who we’re led to understand early in the book operates as a courier or a fixer to make ends meet. We’re also led to understand that Tommy is somewhat knowledgeable about magic and arcane artifacts. There’s no long-winded exposition dump to spell out the nature of the magic, nor are we spoonfed some explanation about how Tommy obtained this knowledge. It’s just an accepted fact of the world we’re dropped into.

In a longer book, this might be frustrating as you try to understand the logic behind its supernatural elements. But at 149 pages, The Ballad of Black Tom has no time to waste detailing a magic system, it has a story to tell.

Tommy embarks on a new hustle that leads him to Flatbush, where he hopes to make a few dollars busking, despite not being a particularly good musician. He is spotted by an elderly man named Robert Suydam, who hires him to play a party at his home. This exchange is witnessed by Officer Malone and a private detective, Mr. Howard, who shake Tommy down and attempt to scare him away from returning to Flatbush. Of course, the promise of $300 in the 1920s is too hard to pass up, and Tommy returns, allowing the rest of the story to unfold.

Warning: Spoilers for The Ballad of Black Tom ahead.

Interspersed between the conjuring of cosmic horrors at Suydam’s home, the assault on the cult compound in Redhook, and the police harassment, we get a handful of scenes with Tommy and his father, fleshing out characters in a way that Lovecraft never did. Tommy has an actual arc, motivations, and personality. When the climax of the book arrives, we’re fully invested in Tommy (who now goes by Black Tom).

Getting attached to Black Tom is important because, well, he’s not the hero. In fact, there are no heroes in this story, really. There are villains, there are victims, but it’s hard to call anyone a hero. Black Tom lashes out at the white men who seek to exploit him and oppress him. It’s cathartic and satisfying as a reader, but his vengeance is also indiscriminate, and it’s implied it will lead to the end of all mankind.

Tommy Tester is a broken man at the end of the story. One who is so tired of the indignities of being a black man in a white man’s world that he would prefer the destructive indifference of the great old ones like Cthulu to the destructive indifference of systemic racism.

The Ballad of Black Tom is not a subtle book, but it’s also a quick and enjoyable read that takes the iconic Lovecraft mythos and gives it real heart. The Horror at Red Hook is not a particularly good story. It has almost no plot, its story arc is a straight line, and the characters have less depth than a sheet of looseleaf. The Ballad of Black Tom salvages what makes Lovecraft compelling, at least in theory (despite his awfulness as a person), and gives us something worth reading in the 21st century.

The Ballad of Black Tom is available on most e-book stores, but I highly recommend you go and buy a physical copy at your neighborhood independent bookshop or support your local library.

On Version History: the story of the crappy controller nobody liked but everybody wanted.

The Nintendo Power Glove was not good. It’s important that you know that. The Power Glove was ambitious, impressive, even important — one of the very first mainstream devices that let you control a game using your body instead of just your thumbs — but it was not good. In some ways, its not-good-ness is a key part of the story.

The Power Glove showed up in the late 1980s, at a complicated time for the gaming industry, when Nintendo was a hugely powerful force for the future of fun. But the Power Glove wasn’t really even a Nintendo product. It started as a research lark, became a toy, and only wound up with Nintendo’s name on it after a particularly fateful pitch meeting. Thanks to a remarkable marketing campaign, and the feeling that VR often gives of simply being the future, the Power Glove wound up a reasonable (if brief) business success. And you can draw a line from the Glove to some other hugely successful Nintendo products — and maybe even to the whole VR industry as we know it.

On this episode of Version History, our chat show about old technology, we dig into the story of the Power Glove. It is, somehow, both very brief and very long. David Pierce, Fandom’s Chris Grant, and Game File’s Stephen Totilo explore the projects that led to the Power Glove, the many (many) reasons it wasn’t a very good product, and the ways in which it changed the future anyway. They also attempt to set up a decades-old Glove and play games with it, which goes… poorly.

Hackers handed out 2 billion in-game credits to every player and unlocked all in-game items.

Yesterday, Ubisoft confirmed that Rainbow Six Siege had been compromised and that it had shut down the game’s servers and marketplace while it resolved the issue. The hackers managed to gain control over a significant chunk of the game’s systems, including the ability to ban and unban users, sending custom messages to ban ticker, unlocking all in-game items, and granting every player 2 billion R6 Credits and Renown.

Ubisoft sells R6 credits in its store, pricing 15,000 of them at $99.99. That means the actual cash value of 2 billion R6 credits is about $13.33 million.

Ubisoft made it clear that nobody would be punished for spending any credits they received. But, any transactions made after 11:ooAM UTC on Saturday (6AM ET) will be rolled back to avoid abuse. At the time of this writing, service had yet to be restored. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment and will update if and when they respond.

            <div id="article-text">Even with the waning power of exclusives, the PS5 still had plenty worth checking out this year.

Even with the waning power of exclusives, the PS5 still had plenty worth checking out this year.

In this new era of console… inclusivity? driven by Sony and mostly Microsoft bringing their exclusives to other platforms, it’s getting harder to highlight games that make a singular console shine. Indeed, the top-performing games year after year on both PlayStation and Xbox are multiplatform releases, and often the best games of the year, like 2025 GOTY winner Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, similarly launch on most everything. (Once again, like in all things, Nintendo is the exception.)

But while lists like this will probably disappear as we get deeper into the era of everything being an Xbox, Sony still seems committed to high-quality exclusives. Here are its best of 2025.

As software exclusivity goes the way of Sega’s console business, console makers have other ways to attract consumers to their part of the video game ecosystem. For Microsoft, it’s Game Pass; for Sony in 2025, it’s the PlayStation Portal. This year, Sony launched an update for the Portal that enables cloud streaming and making the device a must-have for PlayStation households. For $200, roughly half the price of a PS5, you essentially get a second one, able to play select games without the need to stream them from the console. The list of streamable games isn’t comprehensive, but there are over 2,000 of them, and the ability to play them on the go is a literal game changer.

Get into a discussion with true Final Fantasy sickos about the top 10 games in the franchise, and you better have a lot of time and earplugs on your hands as everyone debates entries two through 10 — because No. 1, invariably, is Final Fantasy Tactics. Having finally played the game for the first time, taking advantage of the remaster Square Enix released this year, I get it. The best video games are often timeless while also able to speak to a specific moment, and Tactics’ story is and does exactly that.

But more than narrative, Tactics’ brilliance is also in its expansive job system that grants players a facsimile of godhood that’s so much fun to wield. The arithmetician class has the ability to cast any learned spell in the game instantly and without requiring mana. To offset the class’s ruinously slow speed, pair it with white mage to create the most diabolical unit in the history of strategy RPGs. Ramza Beoulve is just a guy trying to save the world, and FFT made me believe he can because I made his ragtag band of misfits into walking nuclear weapons.

Sucker Punch’s sequel to Ghost of Tsushima plays things relatively safe. It doesn’t change things up dramatically but instead polishes the experience. Which means the experience isn’t all that different from its predecessor — that means lush landscapes to explore, lots of combat techniques to learn, and, uh, plenty of hot springs to bathe in — but everything feels more finely tuned this time around. That’s especially true of the game’s tale of revenge, which is both more gripping than the original and also gives the open-world experience some much-needed structure.

The original Death Stranding was so weird that half of the fun was just wrapping your head around the experience. I’m not sure I really understood it until I was almost done (if at all). The sequel is still plenty weird, but because it builds off of the previous game, it’s also much easier to understand from the get-go. It’s still a delivery simulator where you trek across a postapocalyptic landscape to get goods and people where they’re needed. But now the setting has shifted to Australia, which means there are new environmental elements to deal with — hello, sandstorms — along with a whole new cast of weirdo characters to meet, played by everyone from Elle Fanning to George Miller.

But don’t worry; the story is still as inscrutable as ever.

Bennett Foddy sure made you feel the “walking” part of this elaborate walking simulator. In Baby Steps, your job is to walk, and you do that by controlling every move involved in taking a step, down to the fine motor details. What results is a hilarious examination of human psychology, emotional maturity, and a newfound appreciation for just how hard it is to ambulate a body with nothing more than DualSense trigger buttons.

When Lumines Arise was first announced, I made the mistake of asking, “Oh, is it a series or something?”, unfamiliar with Lumines’ days as a PSP powerhouse. My elders have never let me live that down, so I thought I’d see for myself what the game is.

Lumines Arise is Evil Dr. Tetris Effect Mean Bean Machine. Mean Bean Machine in that the game is played by globbing together matching blocks in two-by-two configurations. It’s part Tetris Effect because the game has an incredible synth / pop-house soundtrack that’s synced to the action, creating a full-body puzzle-playing experience. And evil in that the game is hard as shit. My skills as a Tetris player, limited though they are, just do not transfer to Lumines Arise. But! There is a flow state I can reach. Throughout playing, the shapes of the blocks will change from blocks, to eggs, to clocks, whatever, and I’ve found some patterns are easier to group than others. It’s interesting and fun to figure out what shapes make the game easier for me and which ones are impossible to configure.

Instead of hiding the speaker, Samsung and designer Erwan Bouroullec aim to complement home design.

For years, Samsung has made products that try to camouflage what they are by displaying works of art. The Frame TV is the most famous example, but the company also released the Music Frame, a speaker disguised as a picture frame, at last year’s CES. Now, instead of hiding a speaker with a piece of art, Samsung worked with designer Erwan Bouroullec to make a speaker into a piece of art.

According to Samsung, the Music Studio line of speakers, debuting at CES 2026, draw inspiration from the “timeless dot concept” found throughout music and art. As a musician, the Music Studio 5 reminds me of a fermata, the symbol meant to hold a note or silence. It has a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters with built-in waveguide.

The larger Music Studio 7 is a 3.1.1-channel speaker that can be used on its own, in a pair for wider stereo sound, or with compatible Samsung Wi-Fi speakers, soundbars, or TVs using the company’s Q-Symphony technology. The Studio 7 is capable of playing high-resolution audio up to 24-bit/96kHz, and it and the Music Studio 5 use AI Dynamic Bass Control to extend bass response.

Sometimes these aesthetic-first speakers forget about the most important part of a speaker — its sound quality. But Samsung has done an impressive job over the past few years with its audio tuning which makes me optimistic for the Music Studio’s performance.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/26/1129301/paint-coating-chemicals-materials-cooling-air-conditioning/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <h2>AI Wrapped: The 14 AI terms you couldn’t avoid in 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/25/1130298/ai-wrapped-the-14-ai-terms-you-couldnt-avoid-in-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <h2>Four bright spots in climate news in 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1130191/good-climate-news-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate news hasn’t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world’s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.

We’re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year.

One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world’s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.

That’s happened before, but only when the nation’s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China’s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise.

So what’s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it’s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.

Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That’s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year.

It’s too early to say China’s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030.

To be clear, China still isn’t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it’s now both producing most of the world’s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity—and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years.

It’s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it’s needed most.

Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.

Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology’s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year.

We’re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid.

The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.

But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI’s influence on energy: It’s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies.

In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they’re looking for alternatives.

Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant.

Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don’t. There’s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can’t hurt.

Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We’ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago.

The world is on track for about 2.6 °C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That’s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it’s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 °C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal.

That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development—and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.

The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 °C goal set out in the international agreement.

But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we’ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations yet of the first days of pregnancy and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called blastoids. The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

This means that in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
