            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-oil-industry-doesnt-see-profit-in-trumps-pro-petroleum-moves/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the Trump administration makes announcement after announcement about its efforts to promote the US fossil fuel industry, the industry isn’t exactly jumping at new opportunities.

Some high-profile oil and gas industry leaders and organizations have objected to changes to long-standing government policy positions that give companies firm ground on which to make their plans.

And the financial picture around oil and gas drilling is moving against the Trump administration’s hopes. Though politicians may tout new opportunities to drill offshore or in Arctic Alaska, the commercial payoff is not clear and even unlikely.

Having worked in and studied the energy industry for decades, I’ve seen a number of discoveries that companies struggled to moved forward with because either the discovery was not large enough to be commercially profitable or the geology was too difficult to make development plausible. Market conditions are the prime drivers of US energy investment—not moves by politicians seeking to seem supportive of the industry.

The general decline in oil prices from 2022 through late 2025 has reduced the attractiveness of many drilling investments.

And opening the East and West coasts to drilling may sound significant, but these regions have unconfirmed reserves. That means a lot of subsurface work, such as seismic surveys, stratigraphic mapping, and reservoir characterization—potentially taking years—would need to be done before any drilling would begin.

Offshore drilling also faces enormous opposition.

On the West Coast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta have made forceful statements against any new California offshore oil drilling. They have said any effort is economically unnecessary, environmentally reckless, and “dead on arrival” politically in the state.

California local governments, environmental groups, business alliances, and coastal communities also oppose drilling and have vowed to use legal and political tools to block them.

There is opposition on the East Coast, too. More than 250 East Coast local governments have passed resolutions against drilling.

Governors on both sides of the aisle, including Democrat Josh Stein of North Carolina and Republicans Brian Kemp of Georgia and Henry McMaster of South Carolina, have spoken out against drilling off their coasts.

Drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Beaufort Sea off Prudhoe Bay in Alaska would be a massive undertaking. These projects require years of development and are subject to future reversals in federal policy—just as Trump has lifted long-standing drilling bans in those areas, at least for now.

In addition, Alaska is one of the most expensive and technically challenging places to drill. Specialized equipment, infrastructure for frozen landscapes, and risk mitigation for extreme weather drive costs far above other regions. These projects also face logistical challenges, such as pipelines running hundreds of miles through remote, icy terrain.

Natural gas from Alaska would likely be sold to Asian buyers, who increasingly have alternative sources of supply from Australia, Canada, Qatar, and even the US Gulf Coast. As production rises in those places, the entrance of Alaskan natural gas into the market raises the risk for global oversupply, which could depress prices and reduce profitability.

Despite political support from the Trump administration, the oil and gas companies would need financing to pay for the drilling. And those loans won’t come if the oil companies don’t have agreements with buyers for the petroleum products that are produced. Major oil companies have withdrawn from Alaska and signaled skepticism about attractive long-term returns.

In the first 10 months of the second Trump administration, the president has signed at least 13 executive orders pertaining to the energy industry. Most of them focus on streamlining US energy regulation and removing barriers to the development and procurement of domestic energy resources. However, the broad nature of some of these orders may fall short of establishing the stable regulatory environment necessary for the development of capital-intensive energy projects with long time horizons.

Those efforts have reversed the Biden administration’s go-slow approach to oil drilling, reducing—though not completely eliminating—the backlog of requests for onshore and offshore drilling permits that accumulated during Biden’s presidency.

Delays in permit approvals increase project costs, risk, and uncertainty. Delays can increase the chances that a project ultimately is downsized—as happened with ConocoPhillips’ Willow project in Alaska—or canceled altogether. Longer timelines increase financing and carrying costs, because capital is tied up without generating revenue, and developers must pay interest on the debt while waiting for approvals. Delays also lead to higher project costs, eroding project economics and sometimes preventing the project from turning a profit.

Unlike in some countries, such as with Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Norway’s Equinor, or China’s CHN Energy, the US does not have a national oil or gas company. All of the major energy producers in the US are privately owned and answer to shareholders, not the government.

Executive orders or political slogans may set a tone or direction, but they cannot override the fundamental requirement for profitability. Investments can’t be mandated by presidential decree: Projects must make economic sense. Without that, whether due to low prices, high costs, uncertain demand, or changing regulations, companies will not proceed.

Even if federal policies open new areas for drilling or relieve some regulatory restrictions, companies will invest only if they see a clear path to profit over the long term.

With most energy investments costing large amounts of money over many years, the industry likely wants a sense of policy stability from the Trump administration. That could include lowering barriers to profitable investments by accelerating the approval process for supporting infrastructure, such as transmission power lines, pipelines, storage capacity, and other logistics, rather than relying on sweeping announcements that lack market traction.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trump-spent-2025-attacking-science-that-could-set-back-his-genesis-mission/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By executive order last month, Donald Trump launched his so-called “Genesis Mission.”

Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.

This mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.

Access to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.

However, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.

To critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.

Among the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.

“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.

Also skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.

Her group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.

“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.

Particular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.

In one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.

“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”

Critics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.

Prabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”

Without a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.

“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.

For people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.

In many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.

It also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.

Paul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.

Trump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”

“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”

To Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.

Kelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.

“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”

Just as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”

Trump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.

A Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.

As the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.

Throughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”

Currently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.

“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.

Another concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.

“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.

To turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.

He also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.

Without changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”

And it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.

“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.

Glass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”

“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.

CASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”

“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.

A scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.

To Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”

“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.

Josephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”

“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”

Jules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.

UCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.

Additionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.

“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”

With Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.

“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.

Planning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”

Josephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.

To Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”

“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.

It’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”

The US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”

As it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.

“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/texas-sues-biggest-tv-makers-alleging-smart-tvs-spy-on-users-without-consent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued five large TV manufacturers yesterday, alleging that their smart TVs spy on viewers without consent. Paxton sued Samsung, the longtime TV market share leader, along with LG, Sony, Hisense, and TCL.

“These companies have been unlawfully collecting personal data through Automated Content Recognition (‘ACR’) technology,” Paxton’s office alleged in a press release that contains links to all five lawsuits. “ACR in its simplest terms is an uninvited, invisible digital invader. This software can capture screenshots of a user’s television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time, and transmit that information back to the company without the user’s knowledge or consent. The companies then sell that consumer information to target ads across platforms for a profit. This technology puts users’ privacy and sensitive information, such as passwords, bank information, and other personal information at risk.”

The lawsuits allege violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, seeking damages of up to $10,000 for each violation and up to $250,000 for each violation affecting people 65 years or older. Texas also wants restraining orders prohibiting the collection, sharing, and selling of ACR data while the lawsuits are pending.

Texas argues that providing personalized content and targeted advertising are not legitimate purposes for collecting ACR data about consumers. The companies’ “insatiable appetite for consumer data far exceeds what is reasonably necessary,” and the “invasive data harvesting is only needed to increase advertisement revenue, which does not satisfy a consumer-necessity standard,” the lawsuits say.

Paxton is far from the first person to raise privacy concerns about smart TVs. The Center for Digital Democracy advocacy group said in a report last year that in “the world of connected TV, viewer surveillance is now built directly into the television set, making manufacturers central players in data collection, monitoring, and digital marketing.” We recently published a guide on how to break free from smart TV ads and tracking.

“Companies using ACR claim that it is all opt-in data, with permission required to use it,” the Center for Digital Democracy report said. “But the ACR system is bundled into new TVs as part of the initial set-up, and its extensive role in monitoring and sharing viewer actions is not fully explained. As a consequence, most consumers would be unaware of the threats and risks involved in signing up for the service.”

Pointing out that Hisense and TCL are based in China, Paxton’s press release said the firms’ “Chinese ties pose serious concerns about consumer data harvesting and are exacerbated by China’s National Security Law, which gives its government the capability to get its hands on US consumer data.”

“Companies, especially those connected to the Chinese Communist Party, have no business illegally recording Americans’ devices inside their own homes,” Paxton said. “This conduct is invasive, deceptive, and unlawful. The fundamental right to privacy will be protected in Texas because owning a television does not mean surrendering your personal information to Big Tech or foreign adversaries.”

The Paxton lawsuits, filed in district courts in several Texas counties, are identical in many respects. The complaints allege that TVs made by the five companies “aren’t just entertainment devices—they’re a mass surveillance system sitting in millions of American living rooms. What consumers were told would enhance their viewing experience actually tracks, analyzes, and sells intimate details about everything they watch.”

Using ACR, each company “secretly monitors what consumers watch across streaming apps, cable, and even connected devices like gaming consoles or Blu-ray players,” and harvests the data to build profiles of consumer behavior and sell the data for profit, the complaints say.

We contacted the five companies sued by Texas today. Sony, LG, and Hisense responded and said they would not comment on a pending legal matter.

The complaints allege that the companies fail to obtain meaningful consent from users. The following excerpt is from the Samsung lawsuit but is repeated almost verbatim in the others:

Consumers never agreed to Samsung Watchware. When families buy a television, they don’t expect it to spy on them. They don’t expect their viewing habits packaged and auctioned to advertisers. Yet Samsung deceptively guides consumers to activate ACR and buries any explanation of what that means in dense legal jargon that few will read or understand. The so-called “consent” Samsung obtains is meaningless. Disclosures are hidden, vague, and misleading. The company collects far more data than necessary to make the TV work. Consumers are stripped of real choice and kept in the dark about what’s happening in their own homes on Samsung Smart TVs.

Samsung and other companies force consumers to go through multistep menus to exercise their privacy choices, Texas said. “Consumers must circumnavigate a long, non-intuitive path to exercise their right to opt-out,” the Samsung lawsuit said. This involves selecting menu choices for Settings, Additional Settings, General Privacy, Terms & Privacy, Viewing Information Services, and, finally, “Disable,” the lawsuit said. There are “additional toggles for Interest-Based Ads, Ad Personalization, and Privacy Choices,” the lawsuit said.

The “privacy choices are not meaningful because opt-out rights are scattered across four or more separate menus which requires approximately 15+ clicks,” the lawsuit continued. “To fully opt-out of ACR and related ad tracking on Samsung Smart TVs, consumers must disable at least two settings: (1) Viewing Information Services, and (2) Interest-Based Ads. Each of which appear in different parts of the setting UI. Conversely, Samsung provides consumers with a one-click enrollment option to opt-in during the initial start-up process.”

When consumers first start up a Samsung smart TV, they “must click through a multipage onboarding flow before landing on a consent screen, titled Smart Hub Terms & Conditions,” the lawsuit said. “Upon finally reaching the consent screen, consumers are presented with four notices: Terms & Conditions: Dispute Resolution Agreement, Smart Hub U.S. Policy Notice, Viewing Information Services, and Interest-Based Advertisements Service U.S. Privacy Notice, with only one button prominently displayed: I Agree to all.”

It would be unreasonable to expect consumers to understand that Samsung TVs come equipped with surveillance capabilities, the lawsuit said. “Most consumers do not know, nor have any reason to suspect, that Samsung Smart TVs are capturing in real-time the audio and visuals displayed on the screen and using the information to profile them for advertisers,” it said.

Paxton alleges that TV companies violated the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act with misrepresentations regarding the collection of personal information and failure to disclose the use of ACR technology. The lawsuit against Hisense additionally alleges a failure to disclose that it may provide the Chinese government with consumers’ personal data.

Hisense “fails to disclose to Texas Consumers that under Chinese law, Hisense is required to transfer its collections of Texas consumers’ personal data to the People’s Republic of China when requested by the PRC,” the lawsuit said.

The TCL lawsuit doesn’t include that specific charge. But both the Hisense and TCL complaints say the Chinese Communist Party may use ACR data from the companies’ smart TVs “to influence or compromise public figures in Texas, including judges, elected officials, and law enforcement, and for corporate espionage by surveilling those employed in critical infrastructure, as part of the CCP’s long-term plan to destabilize and undermine American democracy.”

The TVs “are effectively Chinese-sponsored surveillance devices, recording the viewing habits of Texans at every turn without their knowledge or consent,” the lawsuits said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against the BBC on Monday night, seeking a whopping $10 billion in damages.

The suit alleges that the British broadcaster had produced a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump” in its Panorama documentary, which aired in the week leading up to the 2024 presidential election.

More specifically, it accused the BBC of editing his infamous January 6, 2021, speech to make it seem like he had explicitly urged his supporters to storm the US Capitol building prior to the insurrection. At the time, his speech sparked a debate over whether he’d incited violence or not.

“The Panorama Documentary falsely depicted President Trump telling supporters: ‘We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” the lawsuit reads. “President Trump never uttered this sequence of words.”

The lawsuit alleges that Trump said the words, “and we fight,” 55 minutes after saying, “I’ll be there with you,” even though the documentary allegedly made it sound like he said it in a single sequence.

Trump himself, however, made a much stronger claim. During an announcement from the Oval Office on Monday night, Trump said he’s “suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth, literally.”

“They actually had me saying things that I never said coming out of my mouth,” Trump said. “I guess they used AI or something. They actually put terrible words in my mouth having to do with January 6th that I didn’t say.”

The remarks are baffling, since the 33-page suit makes no mention of artificial intelligence and accuses the BBC of editing his speech together to construct a call to action — not some AI deepfake version of the president, as Trump suggests.

To be sure, there are plenty of AI-generated clips of Trump already out there. The president himself likes to post AI slop on his Truth Social account, for that matter. But this lawsuit is about something else entirely, implying that Trump wasn’t successfully briefed on the details prior to his Monday announcement.

Last month, the BBC received a letter from Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chief, Brendan Carr, who has long garnered a reputation for trying to chill speech by abusing his powers. In the letter, Carr accused the broadcaster of splicing Trump’s January 6 speech.

At the time, the BBC buckled to the pressure almost immediately, publicly apologizing. Yet it refused Trump’s demand for financial compensation.

This clearly angered Trump and Carr, given the $10 billion lawsuit that was filed this week.

“The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda,” a White House spokesperson told CNBC. “President Trump’s powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing.”

It’s a mystifying situation that’ll be red meat to critics who say Trump may be losing his grip on reality.

Just this week, Trump posted a deranged takedown of famed Hollywood director Rob Reiner, who was killed in a suspected homicide over the weekend. The president said that the death was linked to “Trump derangement syndrome” in an apparent attempt to take a dig at his critics — remarks that sparked outrage across the political spectrum.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When it comes to toppling governments from behind the scenes, not many know the business better than MI6. Since the end of World War II, British covert operatives have executed 42 coup attempts in 27 countries throughout the world, in pursuit of economic or political outcomes that suit the nation’s interests.

In other words, they know a hostile takeover when they see one — which is why it’s alarming that Blaise Metreweli, the new head of the spy agency, issued a statement warning that global power is increasingly being transferred to the world’s tech corporations.

“Our world is being actively remade with profound implications for national and international security,” Metreweli declared in her first statement as chief of MI6. “Power itself is becoming more diffuse, more unpredictable as control over these technologies is shifting from states to corporations and sometimes to individuals.”

She also noted that “we’re now operating in a space between peace and war.”

“This is not a temporary state or a gradual, inevitable evolution,” she continued.

Over the past few months, politicians from the ruling Labour party have grown increasingly frustrated at political meddling from tech billionaires like Elon Musk, who called for the overthrow of the UK government at a far-right rally in September.

Notably, Metreweli stopped short of calling out any billionaires by name or identifying the systemic issues that got us here, according to The Paper. Instead, she followed other ministers in centering a vague loss of public trust, rather than the profit-driven forces reshaping global power for their own interests.

“The foundations of trust in our societies are eroding,” she said. “Information, once a unifying force, is increasingly weaponized. Falsehoods spread faster than fact, dividing communities and distorting reality. We live in an age of hyper-connection yet profound isolation. The algorithms flatter our biases and fracture our public squares.”

Metreweli is notably the first woman to lead as chief of MI6. Her own history speaks to the intricate web of colonial power brokers that have laid the groundwork for the increasingly monopolistic world we now live in.

For example, Metreweli grew up in the upper crust of British-occupied Hong Kong, where she received a lavish private education. Though she never would’ve had to worry about it, Western corporations have a long history of brutal exploitation of native-born workers and economic collusion with the occupation government.

After receiving her education, Metreweli went on to work as an intelligence operative in the US- and British-occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, important economic zones which were regarded as part of the old British Empire. (Her official assignment was “Second Secretary for Economic Affairs at the Foreign Office” in Dubai, per The Times.)

In short, Metreweli’s alarm over corporate power isn’t so much a critique of tech monopolies in general, but a defense of the British state’s role in influencing world governments. Her speech, shaped by a career fighting for British interests, boils down to a simple refrain: that power should be ours to wield, not theirs.

            <h2>CoreWeave Has Lost a Staggering Amount of Stock Value Over the Past Six Months</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI cloud computing company CoreWave exploded onto the scene in March with the biggest tech IPO since 2021.

The company’s stock soared by more than 40 percent in the following days, riding on the coattails of immense hype surrounding generative AI. The hype was driven by insatiable AI companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta leasing hundreds of megawatts of compute as outfits like CoreWeave construct enormous data centers.

If AI chipmaker Nvidia is the one selling shovels during the ongoing AI gold rush, in other words, CoreWeave is the one buying those shovels in bulk and leasing access to the digging sites.

But persistent fears of an AI bubble have put a massive damper on investor enthusiasm, leaving many to wonder whether CoreWeave could be the canary in the coalmine — and even drawing comparisons to Enron, a company with an extremely speculative valuation that imploded following a major accounting scandal in 2001.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, CoreWeave’s share price has plunged 46 percent in just six weeks, with $33 billion of value going up in smoke. At press time, shares are hovering at just under $70, meaning the company has lost a staggering 56 percent of its stock value in just six months.

It may well be a sign that investors are jittery that the enormous spending by the likes of CoreWeave may not be justified in the long run. Even AI leaders have warned that a return may still be many years out, with OpenAI admitting last month that it won’t make any money until at least 2030.

It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to understand why they’re nervous. Taking on an enormous amount of high-interest debt to construct and lease AI data centers leaves the firm with a considerable degree of risk, potentially putting it first on the chopping block in case the AI bubble were to implode.

Its operations are also meeting some major headwinds, both literally and figuratively. Rainstorms in Texas forced the company to delay the pouring of a foundation for an AI data center complex, pushing back the completion date by months, the WSJ reports.

Investors have also balked at circular financing arrangements in the sector. For instance, Nvidia owns six percent of the company’s shares, while CoreWeave has signed an exclusivity contract with the AI chipmaker to only use its GPUs. Microsoft represented 62 percent of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out last month, and is also a major shareholder of CoreWeave’s top customer, OpenAI.

Then there’s CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator, who downplayed those fears last month.

“If you’re building something that accelerates the economy and has fundamental value to the world, the world will find ways to finance an enormous amount of business,” he said at a Wall Street Journal event in early November.

Days after downplaying concerns over an AI bubble, Intrator was probed by investors during a quarterly earnings call about the delays at the Texas data center construction site.

He argued that “there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” and that “this one data center will catch up, and then we will move forward from there.”

As per the WSJ, the company’s CFO, Nitin Agrawal, was forced to intervene and clarify that there were delays plaguing several data centers for a single “data center provider.”

Investors are also concerned that the enormous amount of debt being taken on could compound significantly due to supply chain bottlenecks. Delays may not sound like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but considering how much money and interest are on the line, an enormous amount of pressure is on CoreWeave to deliver some good news.

“The bull case is that they’ll scale into it, and that a lot of companies have low margins to start, but this is a company at scale,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told the WSJ. “There is no scaling going on here.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/skana-robotics-helps-fleets-of-underwater-robots-communicate-with-each-other/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Underwater autonomous vessels and robots could play a substantial role in defense operations, but submersibles have historically had trouble communicating across large distances unless they rose to the surface. But coming up to transmit poses the very obvious risk of being exposed.

Skana Robotics thinks it’s made a breakthrough with underwater communications using AI — but not the large language models the industry touts today.

Tel Aviv-based Skana has developed a new capability for its fleet management software system, SeaSphere, that allows groups of vessels to communicate with each other underwater across long distances using AI.

The system allows vessels to share data and react to what they hear from other robots. This, Skana says, gives individual units the ability to autonomously adapt to the information they receive and change their course or task while still working toward the same general mission as the fleet. The startup says its software can also be used to secure underwater infrastructure and supply chains.

“Communication between vessels is one of the main challenges during the deployment of multi-domain, multi-vessel operations,” Idan Levy, the co-founder and CEO of Skana Robotics, told TechCrunch. “The problem that we tackle is how you can deploy hundreds of unmanned vessels in an operation, share data, communicate on the surface level and under the water.”

Teddy Lazebnik, an AI scientist and professor at the University of Haifa in Israel, led the research to develop this new capability. Lazebnik told TechCrunch that to build this decision-making algorithm, they couldn’t turn to the latest AI technology, but had to use AI algorithms that are a bit older and more mathematically driven.

“The new algorithms have two properties: they are more powerful, but as a result, are less predictable,” Lazebnik said. “Hypothetically, you’re paying in the performance or the “wow effect” of the of this algorithm, but the older ones, you gain explainability, predictability and actually generality.”

Skana Robotics was founded in 2024 and exited stealth mode earlier this year. The company is currently focused on selling to governments and companies in Europe, as maritime threat levels increase due to the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Levy said the company is in talks for a sizable government contract that it hopes to close by the end of the year. In 2026, Skana hopes to release the commercial version of its product and start proving its tech out in the wild.

“We want to show we can use this in scale,” Lazebnik said. “We argue that our software can handle complex maneuvers, etc. We want to show it. We claim we know how to manage an operation. We want admirals from EU and in EU countries to actually check this argument and see by themselves that we actually get results.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon is in early discussions to invest as much as $10 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would see the AI lab using the e-commerce giant’s AI chips, CNBC reported.

If it materializes, the deal would value OpenAI at more than $500 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source.

Amazon has been looking to diversify its bets in the AI race, which has so far seen it partner up and invest $8 billion in Anthropic, a rival to OpenAI. The e-commerce giant earlier this month also unveiled the latest iteration in its Trainium series of chips, and outlined the development of the next installment of those chips, complementing its cloud computing offerings via Amazon Web Services.

News of the deal comes a couple months after OpenAI completed its transition to a for-profit model, which gives it more freedom to strike deals with investors other than Microsoft, one of the company’s earliest backers with a stake of 27%.

Amazon investing in OpenAI would mark the latest in a series of circular deals in the AI space — major hardware manufacturers and cloud providers strike deals with young AI companies to use their products, while the upstarts commit to using their data centers and chips for training their AI models.

This past March, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy chips from its backer Nvidia. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. Then in October, OpenAI signed a deal to pick up a 10% stake in AMD and committed to using the chipmaker’s AI GPUs, and also signed a chip usage agreement with Broadcom that month. And in November, the ChatGPT maker signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon.

OpenAI and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

            <h2>Google deepens consumer credit push in India with UPI-linked card</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/google-deepens-consumer-credit-push-in-india-with-upi-linked-card/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google is expanding its push into consumer finance in India with the launch of a UPI-linked credit card, betting on a country of more than 1.4 billion people where fewer than 50 million currently hold a credit card.

On Wednesday, Google entered India’s growing co-branded credit card market with the launch of Flex by Google Pay, partnering with private lender Axis Bank to expand access to credit in the country’s UPI-driven payments ecosystem.

India’s rapid adoption of digital payments through the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has transformed how consumers pay but has not translated into broad access to credit. That gap has created an opportunity for technology companies and banks to embed lending into widely used payments apps, helping explain Google’s move into the space.

Flex by Google Pay is issued digitally through the Google Pay app and can be used both online and at physical merchants, the company said. Built on the Indian government-backed RuPay network, the card includes a rewards programme that credits virtual “Stars” on transactions, with each Star worth ₹1. Users can monitor spending and bills within the app, choose to repay balances in full or convert them into installments, and manage security settings such as blocking the card or resetting a PIN.

The launch builds on Google Pay’s broader effort to expand access to credit in India, where it has already partnered with banks and non-bank lenders to offer personal and gold-backed loans through the app. As one of the country’s most widely used UPI platforms, Google Pay offers Axis Bank access to a large, digitally active user base at a time when lenders are increasingly looking to scale credit distribution through technology platforms rather than physical branches.

While Google has started with Axis Bank, it aims to add more issuer partners soon to expand its co-branded credit card offering in India.

Pricing on the card, including interest and applicable charges, will vary by user and credit profile, with no application fee, Google said, adding that charges linked to repayment choices are shown upfront in the app. Processing fees apply to EMI conversions, and late payment charges will be levied in line with the issuing bank’s policy.

India’s credit card market has been expanding rapidly in recent years. The number of outstanding cards has grown at an annual rate of about 14% over the past three years to around 110 million, while transaction volumes and values have risen at close to 30%, per a recent PwC report (PDF). Average annual spending per card has increased from about ₹132,000 (around $1,450) to roughly ₹192,000 (about $2,100), suggesting cards are being used more frequently for routine payments rather than occasional big-ticket purchases.

Despite growth in the number of outstanding cards and credit card spending in India, the expansion has largely been driven by existing users rather than a meaningful increase in the number of cardholders. Google aims to help address that gap by bringing new users into the credit system, particularly those wary of traditional card repayment structures. “It’s the same users getting more and more credit,” said Sharath Bulusu, senior director of product management for Google Pay, adding that flexible repayment options are designed to ease concerns around unpredictable billing for first-time credit users.

“We think we now understand the problem, the space and the user well enough to solve something uniquely for them,” Bulusu told TechCrunch, explaining Google’s timing.

Google’s move comes amid growing competition in India’s co-branded credit card market, where companies including Amazon, as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart and PhonePe, already offer similar products. Consumer internet platforms such as food delivery firms Swiggy and Zomato, along with online travel companies including MakeMyTrip and Yatra, have also entered the space in partnership with banks.

Co-branded credit cards accounted for about 12–15% of India’s total credit cards in the financial year ended 2024 and are projected to capture more than a quarter of the market by volume by 2028, growing at an annual rate of 35–40%, according to a report (PDF) by consultancy firm Redseer.

Alongside the co-branded card launch, Google is also rolling out “Pocket Money,” a feature in the Google Pay app that lets parents give children limited access to digital payments. Built on the recently introduced UPI Circle functionality, the feature lets parents set a monthly spending cap of up to ₹15,000 or approve individual transactions initiated by the child.

Parents receive notifications for each transaction and can view spending history or pause access to the feature through their own Google Pay app, the company said. The move could also help Google broaden Google Pay’s usage and addressable market in India, where it competes closely with Walmart-backed PhonePe among the country’s leading UPI platforms.

Google’s Pocket Money feature follows earlier efforts by Indian fintechs such as FamPay and Junio, which sought to enable children’s digital spending through prepaid cards. However, unlike prepaid instruments, Google uses the UPI Circle framework to let parents retain control of funds until the moment a transaction is made, rather than loading money in advance.

“With UPI Circle, the money stays in the parent’s account until it is spent,” Bulusu said, adding that the approach makes it easier for families already comfortable using Google Pay to introduce children to digital payments. He said the feature reflects a broader bet on familiar payments apps as a way to build financial confidence among younger users as digital payments become more pervasive.

Google is also upgrading the experience for small businesses on Google Pay, allowing customers to rate merchants directly after a transaction, with those reviews syncing to the merchant’s Google Maps listing. The company is also rolling out an AI-powered advertising feature within the Google Pay for Business app that assists merchants in creating and launching ads.

More than 530 million unique users have made at least one payment through Google Pay, while over 23 million small merchants have been onboarded to the platform over the years, Bulusu said. That reach, he added, gives the company confidence it can introduce new financial products to users already comfortable transacting digitally.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-17</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Donald Trump nominated Jay Bhattacharya to be the director of the National Institutes of Health, a shake-up seemed inevitable. Typically, the agency—a $48 billion grant-making institution and the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research—has been led by a medical researcher with extensive administrative experience. Bhattacharya was a health economist without specialized training in infectious disease, who’d come to prominence for his heterodox views on COVID policies and who has criticized the NIH for stifling dissent.

The NIH has been transformed this year. And most of the layoffs, policy changes, and politically motivated funding cuts—notably, to infectious-disease research—have happened under Bhattacharya’s watch. But inside the agency, officials describe Bhattacharya as a largely ineffectual figurehead, often absent from leadership meetings, unresponsive to colleagues, and fixated more on cultivating his media image than on engaging with the turmoil at his own agency. “We don’t really hear from or about Jay very much,” one official told me. (Most of the current and former NIH officials who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.) Many officials call Bhattacharya “Podcast Jay” because of the amount of time that he has spent in his office recording himself talking. “Bhattacharya is too busy podcasting to do anything,” one official told me.

Instead, Matthew Memoli, the agency’s principal deputy director, “is the one wielding the axe,”the official said. This time last year, Memoli was a relatively low-ranking flu researcher at the NIH&#39;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Then, in January, the Trump administration appointed him to be the agency&#39;s acting director. At the time, other NIH officials considered Memoli to be a placeholder, temporarily empowered to carry out the administration’s orders. But “there’s been no change since Jay got put in,” one NIH official told me. To the agency officials I spoke with, Memoli, now second in command, still looks to be very much in charge.

Neither Bhattacharya nor Memoli agreed to an interview, and the NIH did not respond to a request for comment. So to better understand their leadership, I spoke with 18 current and former NIH officials, whose positions at the agency have spanned a breadth of specialties and administrative roles, and reached out to several of Bhattacharya’s former colleagues. The officials’ first impressions of Bhattacharya—who has argued that the NIH could do more “to promote innovative science”—were of an outsider and a radical, whose ideas could have changed the agency for better or worse. In recent months, NIH officials have come to see him as so disengaged that they hardly worry about his impact. Memoli, by contrast, knows just enough about the agency—and, in particular, its approach to infectious disease—to help destroy it.

Memoli’s appointment to acting director in January floored his colleagues—many of whom had never heard his name before. Like Bhattacharya, Memoli had no previous track record of executive leadership or in overseeing the awarding of federal grants. But officials quickly deduced what about Memoli might have appealed to the administration: In 2021, he described COVID-vaccine mandates as “extraordinarily problematic” in an email to Anthony Fauci, then the director of NIAID, whom the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to discredit. Then, last year, when asked to submit a routine statement about diversity, equity, and inclusion, Memoli sent in one that called the term DEI “offensive and demeaning.” By September, the NIH, under Bhattacharya’s leadership, had done away with DEI statements for its scientists, describing them as “loyalty oaths” that Memoli had “courageously stood against.”

In his two months as acting director, Memoli enacted the Trump administration’s agenda with aplomb, pushing through the mass cancellation of grants focused on topics such as DEI, transgender health, and COVID-19; multiple NIH leaders were ousted while he was acting director, including Jeanne Marrazzo, who served as the director of NIAID until early April. “His major function was to do the administration’s bidding,” Michael Lauer, who led the NIH’s grant-making division before he departed the agency in February, told me.

That same month, while Memoli was still acting director, he began to call Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s attention to the flu-vaccine research he’d done with his mentor, Jeffery Taubenberger, another NIAID scientist. By early May—after Memoli had been installed as Bhattacharya’s deputy, and Taubenberger as the acting director of NIAID—HHS had redirected about half a billion dollars, once set aside to develop new COVID-19 vaccines and drugs, to their vaccine work. (Outside researchers criticized the grant as an unjustifiably enormous sum; in an email to me in May, Memoli insisted that the grant would support “more than one project,” but did not answer follow-up questions about how much of that sum would furnish his research specifically.)

Part of a deputy’s job is to take some load off the director. But under normal circumstances, people “wouldn’t really notice who the deputy director is,” one official told me; the director is expected to set policy and lead. Although Bhattacharya has continued to reiterate his own goals for the NIH—including advancing more innovative research—his recent visions for the agency have largely followed administration talking points such as diverting resources toward chronic disease and clamping down on “dangerous” virological research. Yet the director seems out of touch with the reality of that agenda: In his public appearances, internal meetings, and on social media, Bhattacharya has delivered conflicting and sometimes erroneous accounts of the NIH’s grant-making policies. Both publicly and internally, he has fixated more on defending himself against criticism he received for his COVID-policy views from 2020 than on the NIH’s current state of affairs, several officials said.

Bhattacharya, in his own way, still seems to be serving the administration by championing its talking points. But Memoli is the one most visibly throttling the NIH’s capacity to fund research and pushing out some of the agency’s most experienced and internally respected leaders. To officials at the agency, his actions look like those of a leader who has been given broad discretion to shrink down the agency’s infectious-disease work—an area where he may have a few personal grievances. “People are afraid of him,” one official said, pausing. “I’m afraid of him.”

Memoli’s history at the NIH appears to have given him a particular zeal for dismantling it. In his two decades at the agency, Memoli has developed a reputation as a self-aggrandizing co-worker, eager to champion himself and dismissive of people he hasn’t felt he could benefit professionally from, three officials who worked with him prior to 2025 told me. At various points, scientists at the agency lodged complaints about his unprofessional behavior toward colleagues, two NIH officials told me. Memoli, meanwhile, complained that “he wasn’t being given enough,” one of them said. Some of his scientific work was solid, but peers inside and outside the agency criticized some as unremarkable, leaving Memoli with a chip on his shoulder, the two officials said.

Of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers, NIAID, where Memoli once worked, has been among the hardest hit this year, losing most of its senior leadership and a large number of its infectious-disease-focused grants. Since January, multiple officials who denounced the administration’s stance on infectious diseases and vaccines have had Memoli brush aside their concerns in meetings, then been ousted from their roles, three officials told me.

Given the Trump administration’s desire to pare down infectious-disease research, NIAID and prominent officials such as Marrazzo, who succeeded Fauci as director, were always clear targets for cuts. (Yesterday, Marrazzo filed a lawsuit that named Memoli and Bhattacharya and that alleged that she was illegally fired after she had filed a whistleblower complaint about actions of NIH leadership that endangered public health; the Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on the lawsuit.) But in some cases, three officials told me, Memoli appears to have pushed lesser-known officials out of their roles after more personal clashes, including Sarah Read, who was NIAID’s principal deputy director and who repeatedly questioned the circumstances of Memoli and Taubenberger’s sizable vaccine grant. (Read has since left the agency.) Memoli also recently detailed Carl Dieffenbach, the director of NIAID’s Division of AIDS, to another branch of NIH after the two clashed over the administration’s approach to HIV research. Days later, he gave Dieffenbach a scoring of one out of five on a performance review—potential grounds for termination—before human-resources personnel forced him to revise that rating, because he lacked evidence for them, two officials told me. (Read and Dieffenbach declined to comment.)

Memoli has also argued that funding for HIV-vaccine research—which Dieffenbach oversaw—is wasteful and should be cut. The NIH is expected to soon divert up to a third of its AIDS budget toward improving the delivery of existing HIV tools, such as the new drug lenacapavir. At least some of that push has come from Bhattacharya, who has publicly advocated (including on his own The Director’s Desk podcast) for reallocating HIV funds on the grounds that established interventions could resolve the AIDS crisis on their own. But whereas Bhattacharya has waffled when asked how such an investment would affect other research, two officials told me, Memoli has insisted in internal meetings that it should come at the expense of research into HIV vaccines, which is widely considered to be essential to ending the HIV pandemic. Despite being a vaccine researcher himself, he’s “gleefully making these cuts,” one official told me. “Because it means he did something.”

Allowing Memoli to be the executor of the Trump administration’s cuts could serve the independent-thinker persona that Bhattacharya has tried to cultivate. But the NIH officials I spoke with, and one scientist who knew Bhattacharya prior to his appointment at the agency, doubted that his distance was so calculated. Trying to discredit the scientific establishment from the sidelines is far easier than trying to enact reform from its center. At the NIH, the embittered insider may leave the more memorable legacy.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the end of November, two aging clerics gave speeches in Tehran reflecting on the lessons to be drawn from the summer’s Israeli and American strikes on their country. The contrast between the men’s visions shows just what sort of pickle Iran now finds itself in.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared total victory. “Without a doubt, the Iranian nation defeated the Americans and the Zionists in the 12-day war,” he said triumphantly on November 26. “They failed to achieve any of their goals.”

Speaking a day earlier, Hassan Rouhani, a former president and a rival of Khamenei, recommended instead that Iran stop underestimating its adversaries and focus on using diplomacy to deter another war. “Unfortunately, we are still in the state of ‘no war, no peace,’” he said before a group of his former cabinet ministers. “There is no feeling of security in the country.”

Only one of these clerics appears to have the authority to enforce his vision. Khamenei has been the single most powerful person in Iran, and its head of state, since 1989. Rouhani, by contrast, holds no official position and was barred last year even from running for a seat he has held on a supervisory body since 2000.

But appearances can be deceiving. The war dealt a harsh blow to Khamenei. For decades, the leader has congratulated himself on keeping Iran out of direct conflicts. But the past two years have seen the fall of one Iranian ally in the region, the Assad regime in Syria, and Israel’s battering of two others, Hamas and Hezbollah. Then came the June bombardment, which Khamenei spent hiding in a bunker; this cost him the respect of many in the Islamic Republic.

The decline of Khamenei’s powers has emboldened Rouhani and others to challenge his stance and offer alternatives. The Iranian establishment consists of multiple factions that disagree, often vehemently, over the path ahead. Many come closer to Rouhani’s thinking than to Khamenei’s. But so long as Khamenei remains alive and in power, his vision prevails, and the larger mood is one of uncomfortable stasis.

From the October 2025 issue: The neighbor from hell

The months since the 12-day war have been rough going for Iran. In September, the United States and Europe helped bring back United Nations–imposed sanctions that had been lifted in 2015. The country’s economy is in free fall. More than 60 percent of working-age Iranians are not employed. Iran remains one of only three countries—the others are North Korea and Myanmar—on the blacklist of the anti–money laundering outfit Financial Action Task Force. Even ratifying two international conventions (seen, for years, as prerequisites for coming off the list) hasn’t helped. A U.S. dollar now trades for a whopping 1.25 million Iranian rials, a historical high.

The country’s infrastructure is crumbling. Planned and unplanned electricity cuts are now a fact of life. The water crisis is so bad that experts warn of “water bankruptcy.” President Masoud Pezeshkian recently said that if Tehran runs out of water, his government might have to evacuate the city and relocate the capital. The repressive apparatus further weakens morale. Hundreds of people have been executed since the war. Several left-wing scholars have been arrested in recent weeks.

Neither Russia nor China has shown any interest in coming to Iran’s rescue. Mere days after the war ended, Iran’s defense minister attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Qingdao, China; some press reports claimed that China agreed to supply Iran with its long-range surface-to-air missiles, known as HQ-9s, and possibly Chengdu J-1o fighters as well. But the Chinese embassy in Tel Aviv denied the news. The Islamic Republic may have warm ties with China, but it would do well to remember that Beijing also does profitable business with Israel and Iran’s Arab rivals.

Tehran can expect even less from Russia. Iranian officials, including the country’s health minister, have been grumbling for some time about the lack of Russian support in the 12-day war. One official even claimed that the Russians worked with Israel against Iran. Speaking last month, Pezeshkian groused that countries Iran had considered “friends” had abandoned it, leaving Iran to rely on “God and the people” in wartime.

Nonetheless, the regime is doing its best to shore up its relationships and project an image of strength. Ali Larijani, the country’s national security adviser, has traveled to Russia, Belarus, and Pakistan, likely in search of military support. The regime has issued new primary- and high-school textbooks, including one, titled We Will Defend Our Iran, that touts Iran’s military and technological capabilities. Another, written by a well-known hard-line ideologue, promotes “victory based on faith” and “no fear of the enemy.” It shows a Palestinian child who tells her Iranian counterpart: “You are so lucky, Sara, to have security and freedom in your country. I have to always pass Zionist checkpoints.” Its cartoons mock Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.

As part of this tough talk, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which remains ideologically close to the supreme leader, has gone on blustering about closing off the Strait of Hormuz—the “world’s vital oil and gas artery,” according to the head of the militia’s navy, who in October seemed to threaten to choke off the strait if a war broke out. The Tehran Times, an English-language regime mouthpiece, affirmed Iran’s “readiness to deliver a crushing response to any military aggression.” Mohammadreza Naqdi, a top IRGC commander, took this rhetoric up a notch, declaring that if he ran a religious-tourism company, he’d start selling tours to Jerusalem, ludicrously implying that Iran and its allies were about to conquer Israel.

But the bravado rings hollow for most Iranians. They have not forgotten that Israel killed many of the IRGC’s top figures in the early days of the war, humiliating the militia. Naqdi was reportedly demoted due to suspicions that his office might have been infiltrated by Israeli intelligence. Iranians joke that at any top security gathering in Iran, a few people secretly speak Hebrew. Rouhani cautioned in his speech that Israel now dominates the region and can freely operate in Iranian skies. “It’s a dangerous thing when we lie and say we are a great power and our adversaries are weak and miserable,” he said.

The summer’s conflict has left the establishment braced for the possibility of a new outbreak of hostilities. Iran’s military commanders claim that the country would be prepared to launch many more than the 500 missiles it has already fired at Israel, and to include in these barrages long-range ballistic missiles called Sejjils, which it used only sparingly last time. Israeli analysts are aware that Iran would put up a tougher fight a second time around. But Israel retains a significant military edge over Iran and could also step up the damage it inflicts, or go further in trying to destabilize Iran politically or kill more of its leaders. Israel recently killed a top Hezbollah commander in Lebanon, reminding Iran of just how weak its position in the region has become. To underscore the point, Lebanese officials now openly tell Iranian officials to get lost.

As costly as renewed warfare would be for both sides, the greater peril by far would be to Iran, whose failing infrastructure and crisis-ridden economy make it prone to instability even in peacetime. That’s one reason the Rouhani faction and others are pushing to revive diplomacy that could avert a conflict and better Iran’s lot.

President Trump claims that his administration is already talking with Iran in pursuit of a deal. Some in Iran are hopeful that Saudi Arabia will act as mediator: The kingdom has mended its ties with Tehran, and its de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, has said he would like to see an Iranian-American understanding. In recent weeks, the Iranian press has buzzed with rumors that MBS took an Iranian message to Washington to give to Trump.

But Khamenei has angrily denied these rumors as “an absolute lie,” adding that the United States “did not deserve to be contacted by the Islamic Republic.” Earlier in the month, Khamenei said that Iran could “assess” working with the U.S. only if Washington stopped backing Israel and removed its military bases from the Middle East.

These protestations can be taken with some skepticism. The leader struck much the same tone earlier this year, just before Tehran started enthusiastically negotiating with Washington. But the gridlock at the top of the Islamic Republic could make the job of Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, very difficult—if, for example, he isn’t given the power to compromise on key issues, such as Iran’s enrichment of uranium on its own soil.

Mostafa Tajzadeh, a former deputy interior minister and current political prisoner, likens Khamenei to a captain who is running his ship aground but refuses to change course. “Vast and deep changes are inevitable, and everybody waits for a transformation,” Tajzadeh wrote in a recent article, “but nobody knows how and when changes will occur.” Eshaq Jahangiri, vice president under Rouhani, put the point even more plainly in a speech last month: “Nobody knows what to do about the future.”</div>

            <h2>Trump Still Needs Susie Wiles</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/trump-susie-wiles-white-house/685287/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Susie Wiles styles herself as a White House chief of staff who avoids being in the headlines. When cameras come into the Oval Office, she tends to sit just out of frame. She rarely gives interviews. Unlike her predecessors, she seldom tries to curb President Donald Trump’s impulses. She has been lauded in Trump world for instilling a sense of discipline in a chaotic realm, and for providing steady leadership during both Trump’s historic political comeback and the steamrolling start to his second term.

Wiles committed the cardinal sin for a White House staffer—particularly a staffer for this White House—by becoming the news herself with the publication today of a two-part Vanity Fair story in which she offered stunningly forthright assessments of the president and much of his senior staff. Her blunt candor (she said that Trump has an “alcoholic’s personality” and that Elon Musk is “an avowed ketamine” user) was especially surprising because Wiles has presided over a (relatively) on-message White House and is usually so careful herself. The timing is also far from ideal for a West Wing already dealing with a series of GOP electoral defeats, the fallout from Trump repeatedly declaring the nation’s affordability crisis a hoax, and then, yesterday, the president blaming the beloved filmmaker Rob Reiner for his own murder.

Steve Bannon got excommunicated from Trump world—at least for a while—during the president’s first term after his own frank on-the-record exchange with a journalist. But this time, there was no firing, no public meltdown. Instead, Trump shrugged it off. Cabinet members mobilized to defend Wiles. Her job seems safe, at least for now. To many in Trump’s orbit, the White House’s response is a telling reflection of how indispensable she is to the president.

“She was a loyal fighter for him from the moment she came on board,” Donald Trump Jr. posted on social media today. “When things were tough and other supposed friends left my dad like a bunch of rats, Susie stood by his side.”

Still, her words were bracing. Often, senior administration officials talk to reporters on background—offering quotes without their names attached—so that they can speak honestly without deviating from the official White House message or alienating the president. But Wiles spoke on the record, and she appeared to hold little back. She revealed that Trump is indeed hoping to use military strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats to force that country’s leader out of power. She said that Vice President J. D. Vance has been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and that Russell Vought, the budget director, is “a right-wing absolute zealot.” And she tore into Musk, the tech billionaire who spent months destroying the federal bureaucracy, as “an odd, odd duck.”

Wiles’s cooperation with the author Chris Whipple was no secret. She talked with Whipple 11 times over the past year and sat with him in the chief of staff’s office, which occupies a prized perch in the West Wing just steps from the Oval Office. Several other senior staffers—including Vance, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt—also spoke with Whipple and posed for glossy photographs. (Vanity Fair ran several extreme-close-up shots, not all of them flattering.) A few Trump allies told us that they suspected that Wiles had let her guard down with Whipple, who’d written a definitive history on modern White House chiefs of staff, and that the Trump aides had joined the long list of Washington staffers over the years who had succumbed to the lure of a glamorous Vanity Fair photo shoot. Despite Trump’s constant bashing of legacy media, he has spent a lifetime longing for their coverage and approval.

Wiles’s comments were so unexpected—and so, um, honest—that the story sparked frenzied speculation across Washington: Did Wiles think she was off the record? Was she trying to record her version of events for the history books? Was she planning to resign? After the story broke, Wiles called around to her West Wing colleagues in an attempt at damage control, insisting that her quotes had been taken out of context, aides told us. She told The New York Times that she took issue with the quotes attributed to her about Musk’s drug use, saying, “That’s ridiculous” and “I wouldn’t have said it and I wouldn’t know.” But the newspaper reported that Whipple had played the recording of Wiles’s comments confirming that, yes, she had indeed said what he’d written. (Wiles also told Whipple that she didn’t have firsthand knowledge of Musk’s drug use; the tech billionaire had previously admitted to using ketamine.)

Trump, in making his support for Wiles clear, went so far as to confirm in an interview with the New York Post her assessment that he has “an alcoholic’s personality.” Wiles had told Vanity Fair that Trump operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do,” like her own father, the NFL legend Pat Summerall, who had a drinking problem. Trump does not drink and looks down on those who do, but he claimed not to have been bothered by that comparison. If he did imbibe, he said, “I’d have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It’s a very possessive personality.” (When Trump first met Wiles, then a Florida political operative, he loved that she was Summerall’s daughter; many of the president’s favorite cultural touchstones date from the 1980s, the decade in which Summerall and John Madden teamed up to become the NFL’s signature TV-broadcast team.)

In a social-media statement posted soon after the story’s publication, Wiles called it “a disingenuously framed hit piece.” Leavitt did as well, writing that “President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie.” And then she directed top Trump officials to fan out on social media to defend Wiles; agency heads such as Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Doug Burgum were among the nearly two dozen senior officials who posted praise for the chief of staff. The vice president, delivering a speech in Allentown, Pennsylvania, even laughingly acknowledged that he could, in fact, be a conspiracy theorist.

“We have our disagreements,” Vance said of Wiles. “We agree on much more than we disagree, but I’ve never seen her be disloyal to the president of the United States, and that makes you the best White House chief of staff that I think the president could ask for.”

The show of force underscored Wiles’s importance to Trump, who churned through four chiefs of staff during his first term. After Trump left office in disgrace in early 2021, Wiles agreed to coordinate his fundraising efforts and political activity. A year later, she took the helm of his reelection campaign, which, at the time, seemed like a long-shot bid. She, along with the GOP consultant Chris LaCivita, put together a far more professional operation than in any previous Trump campaign, and cut down on the staff infighting and leaking that defined his two earlier runs. She publicly claimed that she never tried to control Trump, but she did, on occasion, get him to back away from outlandish ideas. In a moment famous in Trump’s circles, Wiles stepped into the candidate’s line of sight during a particularly dark and rambling Pennsylvania rally in the campaign’s final week and simply glared at him. The unspoken message: Stop it, and move on. Trump eventually did. The president is deeply fond of her, staffers told us, and once praised her as the “most powerful person in the world” while also, oddly, at times calling her “Susie Trump.”

The circle of power in the West Wing is small—Vance, Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a few others—and Wiles, in many ways, wields the most influence. She streamlined processes, cracked down on talking to the press, and demanded loyalty from the staff. Wiles largely reduced the chaos, dysfunction, and turnover that permeated Trump’s first term and was able to help secure passage of a sweeping tax bill and a dramatic expansion of executive power.

She revealed to Vanity Fair a number of occasions when Trump ignored her advice. She said that she’d tried to persuade him not to pardon the most violent January 6, 2021, rioters and urged him to hold off on announcing his sweeping tariffs plan. She openly criticized the way Musk slashed international-aid programs. She admitted that some of the prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice directly stemmed from Trump’s desire for revenge. And she said that Trump broke their “loose agreement” to end his “score settling” against political enemies that she’d feared would distract from his agenda after the first 90 days.

Now Wiles herself has become the latest in a string of distractions. The momentum that she helped engineer stalled out this summer when the GOP legislation proved unpopular and Jeffrey Epstein returned to the headlines. Since then, rising prices and a sense that Trump has overreached in expanding his executive power have led to a string of Democratic wins at the ballot box and a fear among Republicans that the president has lost touch with the promises that returned him to the White House. And yesterday, even some in the president’s own party denounced his assertion that Reiner was killed alongside his wife because he was a Trump critic. (Prosecutors have said that the couple’s son, who has spoken openly about his struggles with drug addiction, will be charged with their murder.)

Although Trump announced a speech to the nation tomorrow night that is meant to recap a year of accomplishments, some in the West Wing privately admit that a revised approach to governing—including possible staffing changes—could be on the horizon in the new year. Wiles has said that she told Trump that he needs to start campaigning again. And the vice president volunteered his own idea for a course correction.

“If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article,” Vance said in Pennsylvania, “I hope that the lesson is that we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream-media outlets.”

I&#39;m 100% in favor of that. I want the true cost in my purchase. End the dark patterns of giving me a bunch of &#39;discounts&#39; then asking me to tip on the &#39;orignal price&#39; which is already more than the store charges, then charge me a delivery fee on top.

If I&#39;m paying a delivery fee, why does the food cost more before the fee? What part of the fee is funding the delivery? Is this like a convenience fee? Who exactly is getting the convenience?

Rich people: Just massively raise prices. Everyone will be happy.

Overwhelming majority of people: What the fuck? I guess I&#39;ll go elsewhere.

Rich people: They must be bigoted or something.

Well don&#39;t raise prices and end tipping. If only rich people are tipping then why are we doing it at all?

I&#39;m told tipping is not optional and the person serving me food needs it to live. So if that is the case why are poor people eating out and taking food out of the servers mouth if they can&#39;t tip?

Luckyo is clearly the foreign asshole who goes &quot;tipping is optional&quot; and walks out of the restaurant leaving his waiter with the fat 2-whatever an hour base pay that&#39;s been the same since the boomers were flipping burgers.

So you&#39;re saying that you basically collect handouts when you go out to eat?  That you let the guilty rich subsidize your waitstaff because you just don&#39;t have enough money to pay?

Somehow I think Doordash can afford to pay their employees a bit more. https://ir.doordash.com/news/n... [doordash.com]

Define &quot;normal salary&quot;.the basic amount you need to make a living from a job without depending on extra &quot;charity&quot;?

the basic amount you need to make a living from a job without depending on extra &quot;charity&quot;?

Start with $25 Minimum Wage [profgalloway.com] and then see where things go from there.

Walmart and McDonald&#39;s pay shit and then encourage employees to sign up for public assistance.

That means corporations are subsidizing their low wages with YOUR tax dollars.

My boss is always complaining they can&#39;t get reliable entry level techs. Well you pay gas station wages you get gas station quality work.

They constantly propagandize to tipped workers that they make more money.So strange that all these supposedly six figure waitstaff i&#39;ve met in my life seemed to have lifestyles that max out comparable to an E-5.But you know i met a lot of gamblers who insist they have a system.

In every app I use you can tip in advance and then adjust the tip after the fact. I do that a lot when a driver delivers food to the wrong house and then asks me to go get it.

You know what&#39;s a luxury experience?  Hitting 20% every time and not thinking about it like a boomer on a power trip.  Really makes the entire meal much better to not do part of the owner and manager&#39;s job and to just enjoy your meal.

This is about tipping, not about normal payment information.   The idea of having proper wages for drivers, can you really be against that?   On the flip side, it&#39;s weird that tips aren&#39;t being given because people aren&#39;t being asked to give the tip until after service has been given, so I&#39;m not sure why tips have dropped off.

I want gig workers to receive a living wage whether I am doing business with them or not, but this is the wrong way to try to accomplish that.

The right way is to change the employment laws such that they have to be paid decently, and to raise the minimum wage if necessary, etc.

Trying to solve the problem with tips is completely wrong. They&#39;re supposed to be an expression of appreciation above and beyond what you need to survive, not the basis of survival. Trying to trick the customer into paying that indire

Privatizing profits while socializing risk and cost? Hell, that&#39;s practically the blueprint for multinationals nowadays.

The demarcation between responsible representative democracy and oligarchal kleptocracy is as thin as the legislation regulating political contributions.

You, my friend, are an acting politician.

Meanwhile their voters parrot attack against Big Oil. What did that other article today say, each rack uses 350kw now? Wow. Why even buy energy efficiency anything around the home when Big Tech comes in with their big money, vacuums up the power like a black hole, and blows up the price for the avg person? Not just that but wrecks the environment with much of that power comes from some toxic renewable like wood chips, fossil fuel like a combined cycle natural gas plant, or some other unclean source. Or the

Nice list.  Not every day my eyes are widened a bit more as to the ripple effect.

To your point we shouldn’t make this purely about electricity costs.  By doing that, Greed will focus on ONLY that as a “solution” to perpetuate their ongoing environmental harm.  One day, they’ll try and win over an entire city they crushed electrically by saying they’ll pay everyone’s electric bill.

I&#39;m mostly a free market guy, and it&#39;s because of the consequences. Any time we naively try to reorganize society to be nicer for everyone in it, the unintended consequences (the created incentives) screw things up. Like how price controls create shortages and black markets. Or if you ever nationalize anything, people get cold feet about investing for the next hundred years. These principles favor honoring deals, and not ever writing legislation that loots a company (like changing zoning laws so they can&#39;t

When &quot;Free Market&quot; also supports giving the very wealthy a lower percentage tax rate on their income compared to people who earn under $100,000 per year, shouldn&#39;t that be seen as a negative consequence for society just to benefit those wealthy people and the politicians they are buying with their unlimited &quot;campaign contributions&quot; that Citizens United has allowed?

Remember, the idea of rules and regulations aren&#39;t to &quot;reorganize society&quot;, it is to prevent problems that harm people.   The whole idea of the R

I support taxes. I&#39;m not sure what level is best for society. Hope that clarifies everything!

This is correct, taxes, even very high taxes, are critical aspects to capitalism and that should be far more widely accepted.

The free market gave us rather dangerous smog in several cities and dangerous water before the EPA got on the case*. The private insurance industry (among others) is responsible for out of control medical costs, and it is not going to fix the problem or be part of a solution. OSHA shut down dangerous workplace practices that those nice corporation inflict on their workers*. NHTSA got rid of many dangerous practices*. Should I continue or are you so mired in &quot;free market&quot; double-speak that you are beyond rea

The vast majority of those of us in the USA and really, in most places, are NOT the ones pushing all these AI data center expansions.    Only the wealthy and those who bought stock have seen any benefit from the AI bubble, and even though my 401k also shows a gain from it, when the bubble pops, it&#39;s going to be bad for the retirement accounts for those of us in the USA.

You shouldn&#39;t confuse the Clinton-Democrats for being on the left.   Those &quot;centrists&quot; are really a bit on the right, they embrace conservatives like Joe Manchin and then attack any progressives, who are the ones trying to move things back to the left after decades of Republicans pulling politics in the USA far to the right.

Remember, the Republican platform from the 1950s is actually quite a bit to the left of where the Democratic Party establishment is these days.

This is going on right now in my rural town in Virginia, as they are planning a massive AI datacenter in an industrial park created about 20 years ago that has been mostly empty (except for a few massive tenets, like one of the largest Gatorade plants in the US at 1 million square feet). Environmental groups have already seeded the community with fear (we have this cut-throat Facebook gossip page that was posted to, and now everyone is up in arms). People have been flooding the county supervisor meetings and so on.

Just in the last couple days the county released a much more detailed explanation of the datacenter&#39;s consumption of both electricity and water, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s eased people&#39;s minds much.  Our power is supplied by American Electric Power, which has over 5 million customers and very deep pockets. We also have close to 100 MW of solar farms, and two hydroelectric dams on the New River at the edge of the county, and very robust power infrastructure here. So I don&#39;t think there would be any regional issues with power (as compared to other states that have much smaller and even municipal-level power companies that have to pass infrastructure spending onto a much small customer base).

I see, so if they can pass the data center inflicted extra costs on a large customer base, then it is okay. Thanks for showing just how thought-constipated is your reasoning.

I&#39;ve got a daytime job and I&#39;m doing alright.

I&#39;m hoping the extra iron going into the sea will cause plankton to grow faster and absord more CO2. Also more forest = greater CO2 absorbtion. Though obviously this is probably more than offset by the permafrost melting not to mention forests dying off where its now too hot further south.

The leaching is not just iron, it is also other metals, some of them quite dangerous to fish and people. We do not yet know what the effect will be.

What doesn&#39;t get enough attention are sea currents. Aside from the atmosphere, they are the key to the climate, and not something we can really control. Changing sea currents in the Atlantic can cause much colder weather in the lower part of the Northern hemisphere, and also cause more extreme weather patterns. Everything is connected, everything influences everything, and the Earth is a closed ecosphere which we&#39;re all a part of. Since we have passed the point where things could be reversed, things will ju

Can the reaction cause more problems than the phenomenon, as with immune responses to Covid, drug wars, etc.?

It is not a foregone conclusion that the die is cast, but the future&#39;s prospects are dimming.

It appeared for the longest time that humanity might rise above its base instinct for self fulfillment: perhaps rejecting tribalism for the species greater good.

Worst case scenario? Whatever is coming won&#39;t get us all. We&#39;re a resilient creature, and may survive in the numbers necessary to muck this all up again.

It depends on how you define it. If you think of it from a purely mineral basis then sure, the arctic is not looking at many changes. If you&#39;re thinking about the animal life that is there, it&#39;s in trouble. We are not the only animals on this mudball.

Why can&#39;t we repopulate the south pole with polar bears to save them?

Russia is basically counting on an ice free Arctic within our lifetimes.

We really should recognize Denmark&#39;s claim before shit gets explodey.

For those who don&#39;t know where the lie is, it&#39;s the entire thing. They have de facto declared state of icy death, the large scale permanently frozen Arctic as a &quot;good thing&quot; and life larger than a handful of bacteria that can survive this environment slowly reclaiming it a &quot;bad thing&quot;.

One great example of the massive hypocrisy in question is the state of Polar Bears. They used to be the symbol of the &quot;protect the Arctic&quot; movement. Well, as larger life comes back to Arctic as Ice Age continues to recede, the

Discussions of race are everywhere and nowhere in 2025. On one hand, President Donald Trump is openly insulting Somali immigrants, describing entire nations as “shithole” countries, and insisting that the most persecuted class of humans are white South Africans. On the other, none of this is actually registering as anything other than Trump being Trump, and so when the Supreme Court agrees to revisit a foundational doctrine like birthright citizenship, too many of us shrug it off. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill about her recent Substack, “Is It Too Late,” in which she argued that it is not too late to save American ideals of democracy and equality, but it is assuredly too late to remain indifferent. Part of that conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity below.

Dahlia Lithwick: There is a very human propensity, especially in times of crisis, to normalize and rationalize and temporize. We comfort the comfortable, and we look for hope in norms and in institutions and in rationality. So many people have this perpetual hope that something’s going to come along and life is going to go back to 2010 or 2012. This hope says that with enough time, and even if it’s uncomfortable right now, someone else is going to come along, or some institution is going to come along, and put us in the DeLorean and we’re all going to go back. Can you talk about the ways in which American exceptionalism and the American normalization bias and the profound—just to talk about the Supreme Court as an example—American trust in institutions can get us to the point where it’s not that we don’t see the fire, we can’t even smell the smoke. You write, “everyone should be on full alert,” but you and I both know that not only are people not on full alert, I’m not even sure what could put them on full alert.

Sherrilyn Ifill: I think things are unraveling pretty fast and people will get on full alert. The only question is, when they get on full alert, will it be too late? That’s why I’m saying: “You might want to do that now.” I’ve been guilty of this as well: not ringing the alarm bell with sufficient urgency. This is something lawyers do all the time, because we’re used to finding the little interstices and figuring out how to move within these small spaces so that we can get where we want to go and so that we can make change. I was trained in that tradition—you find a way, you find a pathway, and all of that presumes the legitimacy of the framework.

I’m not a nihilist. I actually always do have hope. And I think one of the reasons I feel so clear, in this moment, is that I have no desire to return to 2010. I have no desire to return to the ’80s. I’ve been a civil rights lawyer for 35 years. The ’80s were a nightmare.

What are we returning to? I don’t have a dream time calling out to me. People will say, “When Obama was president.” I mean, really? Because most of the videos you’ve seen of police killing unarmed black men, most of that was in the second Obama administration. That was Eric Garner. That was Ferguson. That was Walter Scott running in that park. So if you’ve been doing the work that I’ve been doing, you’re always invested in the future.

I have excitement and hope in this time because as this whole thing begins to unravel, we have the opportunity to create something new. This is where the 14th Amendment is so helpful for me, because it’s one of the biggest moments of creating something absolutely new in this country, so I use it as inspiration, not only its very words and provisions and guarantees, but also to remind me that we have the right and the obligation to refound our country when it goes astray. That’s what those young kids in college during the Civil Rights Movement did. They did a version of refounding. So I don’t want to suggest that I don’t feel hope for the future. I do feel quite hopeful. But I also feel that pretending that all we need to do is just make some incremental changes to get us back to 2010 interferes with our ability to do that reset. What has been laid bare is that 2010 ain’t it.

We have some serious structural problems. As a litigator, I don’t know how anyone can purport to pretend that they know what the rules are at the Supreme Court anymore. We have a Supreme Court that not only has the power to say what the law is, pursuant to Chief Justice John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison, but they’ve now decided that they have the power to say what the facts are. That has never been part of our system of adjudication and litigation. Assigning factual findings to the Supreme Court? No, that is for the trial courts, for district courts. But we are now seeing a majority on the Supreme Court that regularly swats away the findings of the district court. That is the power of the district court. They are closest to the conflict. They can evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. They’re seeing the exhibits, the documents, all of it. It’s playing out in real time. It’s not theoretical for them. And now we have a Supreme Court that months later will swat away a two-week trial and the findings of fact over 160 pages by a district court. That’s real. That is real and structural. And it should not be dependent on the personnel of the court.

Last week was a startling and arresting moment for me in terms of the Trump v. Slaughter arguments about Humphrey’s Executor. Put aside originalism, that’s gone, there’s not even a pretense of text and history. But the idea that, “Well, you know, since agencies don’t look like they did 100 years ago, I guess we don’t have to think about them the same way.” It is so strange to see serious people pretending to be doing serious work in this serious place, when all pretense of intellectual seriousness has fallen away. Instead you have feelingsball and “How does executive power make me feel today?” There is no commitment to the principles that were laid out and in which people like you and I as institutionalists took a lot of solace. Part of what is so challenging about this moment is that by the time most Americans get around to the point that they can say the sentence “Amy Coney Barrett’s not going to save us,” or “Brett Kavanaugh is not going to save us,” it’s all going to be too late. It seems we are so committed to the principle that they are originalists, that they are textualists, that they care about a precedent, and so committed to the proposition that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to save us in the end.

The irony of it is that the U.S. Supreme Court got this reputation and the confidence of the American public after Brown. And that’s why, as much as this court is hollowing out Brown, they’ll never overturn it because that is how they became—how they got the reputation, certainly among Black people, for many decades, of being the people who come to your rescue. The shift started to happen with the Burger court in the 1980s.

So many of those who have the greatest platforms are still speaking and behaving in a way that suggests that this is something easily solved, or this is just how it goes, or we can just do this for a couple of years. But if you are watching the videos of people being chased by masked figures who claim to be federal agents, but we don’t know, and who are kidnapping people and throwing them in vans and doing this to American citizens and holding them? The danger is just there. It  is apparent. The more we treat it as though this is just Trumpism, this is Trump 2.0—all the little things that we say to tamp down the alarm are really profoundly problematic.

Many of those who have the greatest microphones frankly don’t know very much about race or racism or the history of it in this country. They want to be experts, so they play to their expertise. These are also the people who have said, “We talk about race too much. We talk about identity too much. We’re scaring people off with that. Everything’s not race.” We’ve made it seem illegitimate to talk about racism. It’s almost like you’re being soft, you’re being anti-intellectual, you’re not doing the rigorous work of politics if you’re talking about race.

In fact, race is threaded through every institutional structure of this country. And we have someone who is exploiting it every day. It’s not that I’m talking about race, it’s that he just stood up the other day and said, We want the Danes, the Swedes, and the Norwegians. We don’t want people from shithole countries. We’re being told that it’s illegitimate to keep talking about race when we’re confronting a tsunami of a movement that uses racism as its stalking horse. It is the lure that brought so many people into this movement. It’s important to help people understand that that’s the bait they’re using. The bait that says, “Yeah, I’m not sure that those people are qualified,” right? Yeah, all of that stuff that just lives in this country, that’s being used as the bait for this smash-and-grab, for this power grab. And I don’t think we’re doing this country any favors by steering people away from that realization.

In A24’s Civil War, a journalist, played by Wagner Moura, pleads with the militiaman, played by Jesse Plemons, who has detained him and his colleagues at gunpoint. “We’re American.” The militiaman replies, “What kind of American?” In a flood of executive orders and proposed bills, the GOP asks U.S. citizens the same question.

This month, Bernie Moreno, a Senate Republican from Ohio, introduced the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025, legislation that would compel any U.S. citizen with a second citizenship to choose between the two. Though Moreno’s bill is likely to face heavy resistance due to 14th Amendment protections, it’s a reminder for people like my family and me: Not all U.S. citizenships are created equal.

I was born and raised in the U.S. I’m a U.S. citizen, but I’m also a Spanish citizen through my parents, who were both Spanish citizens when I was born. I never really thought much about my Spanish citizenship. More than anything, I’m American. I grew up watching The Wonder Years, building model planes with my dad, and playing basketball. Plus, my English is a lot stronger than my Spanish. But the more this administration and its acolytes insist I choose, the more fiercely I cling to my heritage.

This isn’t the first time this year that Republicans have reminded me of my family’s second-tier citizenship. Though foiled by the courts so far, this administration has made a concerted effort to end birthright citizenship—the way I became a U.S. citizen—an effort that has made its way back to the Supreme Court. The administration’s plan for birthright citizenship wouldn’t affect me directly, as it wouldn’t be—at least in its current version—retroactive. But it underscores a fundamental truth of this movement’s worldview: How one becomes a U.S. citizen affects the perceived value of said citizenship, which effectively creates tiers of citizenship. (Incidentally, historians and legal scholars consistently cite tiered citizenship as a hallmark of fascist states.)

The Department of Justice has prioritized denaturalization more broadly, as outlined in a June memo. I worry about the implications for people I love, like my wife, my mom, and my sister, all of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. On paper, I shouldn’t worry. They’re all law-abiding people, and this directive ostensibly aims to ferret out terrorists and criminals.

That’s what this administration said about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mission, but the agency’s egregious flouting of due process tells a starkly different story. According to ICE’s own numbers, the majority of migrants in detention have no criminal convictions.

In other words, I don’t trust this administration and its devotees when they say they’re only going after the “bad guys.” It’s clear they think the bad guys are anyone with the temerity to speak another language or identify with another culture. A few days after Moreno introduced this piece of legislation, Donald Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

This White House is hell-bent on upholding an English-speaking monoculture, hence the designation of English as the official language of the United States back in March. There’s no room for another language or another culture. If the bill were to pass, I wonder if special dispensations would be made for Melania Trump and Barron Trump, both of whom are dual citizens.

It all stems from a zero-sum philosophy, to which the author of this proposed legislation subscribes. Born in Colombia and naturalized at 18 years old, Moreno insists: “It’s all or nothing. It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.” Therein lies the crux of our differences: Moreno believes that the only way to be a “true” American is to slough off your heritage and pledge your exclusive loyalty, whereas I, like many others, believe that the U.S. is at its best when it activates all participating cultures—and at its worst when it attempts to homogenize them.

I grew up in a mixed-status household. My parents and my sister lacked legal status when I was growing up. As a child, I was oblivious to their fears and the dangers we faced as a family. Immigration hard-liners would argue that they should’ve followed the law and that I should never have become a U.S. citizen. Well, birthright citizenship is enshrined by the 14th Amendment and the General Amnesty of 1986, passed by the Reagan administration, which both say otherwise. You don’t have to like existing immigration laws. You can work to change or overturn them, but then you have no choice but to admit that this fight isn’t about following existing law.

Immigration hard-liners also like to say that the immigrants should’ve come here the proverbial “right way.” What they don’t realize is that many immigrants do come here the so-called right way. They may live in the United States legally for many years with temporary protections, for so long that they lay down roots, buy homes, and raise children, only to have those protections revoked overnight. Then, suddenly, having never committed a crime, they’re called criminals, subject to government-sanctioned abduction.

That’s the funny thing about rules in this country: They have a nasty habit of suddenly turning on you—especially when, in Republicans’ eyes, you’re not the right kind of American.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/microsoft_admits_that_message_queuing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has good news for administrators: while some organizations now pay for security updates on older Windows versions, the inconsistent quality remains free.

The company has confirmed that Message Queuing (MSMQ) might fail on some Windows 10 devices and on older versions of Windows Server after installing the December 2025 Security update.

The problems include MSMQ queues becoming inactive, Internet Information Services (IIS) sites failing with &quot;Insufficient resources to perform operation&quot; errors, and applications failing to write to queues.

To compound the problem, logs are stuffed with misleading errors such as &quot;There is insufficient disk space or memory&quot; despite there being plenty of both.

The glitch is actually to do with folder permissions and where MSMQ wants write access. In its documentation for the issue, Microsoft said: &quot;This issue is caused by the recent changes introduced to the MSMQ security model and NTFS permissions on the C:\Windows\System32\MSMQ\storage folder. MSMQ users now require write access to this folder, which is normally restricted to administrators.

&quot;As a result, attempts to send messages via MSMQ APIs might fail with resource errors.&quot;

It also impacts clustered MSMQ environments under load.

According to Microsoft, the defect impacts Windows 10 22H2 and earlier (up to 1607), and Windows Server 2012 to 2019. &quot;Individuals using Windows Home or Pro editions on personal devices are very unlikely to experience this issue. This issue primarily affects enterprise or managed IT environments.&quot;

Microsoft suggested contacting its support team for a workaround. Other users reported that uninstalling the update also did the trick, though doing so would mean losing the security fixes it contained.

MSMQ has been around for decades in one form or another, and can trace its lineage back to the days of Windows 95 and NT4. It is a messaging protocol that allows applications to communicate in a failsafe manner by queuing messages until they can be sent and received.

A failure of MSMQ can result in a raft of applications stopping working.

Fortunately, only Microsoft&#39;s older operating systems are affected. Unfortunately, these are the ones that tend to be kept alive by enterprises deferring the pain and expense of upgrading, or following the &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; philosophy.

Alas, the truism probably needs an update these days: &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. Until Microsoft breaks it…&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">X has filed a lawsuit against a social media startup over the Twitter brand, effectively acknowledging that millions still use the Twitter domain, call Elon Musk&#39;s platform &quot;Twitter,&quot; and their emissions &quot;tweets.&quot;

A week ago, Operation Bluebird announced that &quot;after 12 months of quiet work,&quot; it had filed to claim the Twitter trademark.

Having acquired Twitter in 2022, billionaire Musk ditched the branding in favor of X a year later. Gone was the bird logo and the name of the company he splurged $44 billion for. Years on, one might assume the name &quot;Twitter&quot; and its associated branding should be fair game, right?

Wrong. In response to Operation Bluebird&#39;s attempt to claim the trademark, X&#39;s complaint [PDF] snapped back: &quot;Twitter never left and continues to be exclusively owned by X Corp.&quot;

The complaint continues: &quot;Each day, more than four million users access the X platform through the TWITTER.com domain; users around the world continue to refer to the platform as TWITTER and posts as TWEETS; consumer- and client-facing webpages continue to use each of the TWITTER Marks; third-party licensees continue to display the TWITTER logo as the social media favicon on their business websites.&quot;

Considering the effort Musk and his minions have put into burying Twitter, the acknowledgement that millions of users still reject Musk&#39;s preferred X is telling. X could have gone down the route of simply contesting the trademark claim. Instead, it has gone on the offensive against Operation Bluebird and filed suit.

As well as calling for a halt to Bluebird&#39;s attempts to swipe the Twitter branding and demanding that the United States Patent and Trademark Office &quot;be directed to deny and invalidate Bluebird&#39;s application to register the infringing TWITTER mark,&quot; the suit also calls for damages.

The Twitter brand might be buried, but in its lawsuit, X has admitted that millions of users still cling to it. Musk&#39;s soapbox is therefore not about to let anybody start poking around its grave. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has hired former UK finance minister George Osborne, continuing a trend of British politicians whose careers have peaked cozying up to US tech giants.

Osborne, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016 under Prime Minister David Cameron, announced the move on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, saying he will work as managing director and head of OpenAI for Countries while based in London.

He follows the lead of Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat leader and deputy PM under Cameron&#39;s coalition government, who did a stint as chief apologist for Facebook parent company Meta between 2018 and 2025, and former PM Rishi Sunak, who has taken up advisory roles with both Microsoft and AI biz Anthropic.

OpenAI for Countries is an effort to export the company&#39;s Stargate project to other nations beyond the US. Stargate itself is an ambitious plan to somehow raise and invest $500 billion over the next four years to build infrastructure to power AI in America, which kicked off last year as a union between the AI developer and Microsoft.

Announcing OpenAI for Countries in May, the biz claimed it had &quot;heard from many countries asking for help in building out similar AI infrastructure,&quot; and that they &quot;want their own Stargates and similar projects.&quot;

Osborne said in the post announcing his appointment: &quot;I recently asked myself the question: what&#39;s the most exciting and promising company in the world right now? The answer I believe is OpenAI.&quot;

&quot;In my conversations with Sam Altman, Brad Lightcap, and other senior colleagues, it&#39;s clear they are exceptionally impressive leaders and that they care very deeply about their mission to ensure the power of artificial intelligence is developed responsibly, and the benefits are felt by all,&quot; he added.

Osborne&#39;s legacy as Chancellor of the Exchequer is that his austerity policies following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 introduced tax rises and harsh spending cuts that were blamed for delaying Britain&#39;s economic recovery and damaging public services, while failing to deliver on the goal of reducing the country&#39;s budget deficit.

After this, he served as editor of London newspaper The Evening Standard during a period that saw its continued financial decline, so it is easy to see why OpenAI decided he is a safe pair of hands for its international expansion.

However, concerns have already been raised over OpenAI&#39;s finances, with HSBC warning that the business would need to secure $207 billion in new financing by 2030 to support its expansion plans, yet isn&#39;t expected to turn a profit before then.

The company has also announced a number of circular deals with other tech businesses, in which they agree to invest in OpenAI and it in turn agrees to invest some or all of the cash back into procuring products or services from them.

In September, for example, GPU maker Nvidia said it would hand OpenAI up to $100 billion in investment, while the ChatGPT creator agreed to buy &quot;at least 10 gigawatts&quot; of Nvidia systems for its datacenters.

Then, in October, AMD announced it had issued OpenAI with a warrant for up to 160 million shares of the chip company&#39;s common stock, in exchange for &quot;6 gigawatts&quot; of AMD GPUs to help drive AI model development.

OpenAI – along with other AI firms – has also been involved in controversy over allegations that it used copyrighted material to train its models without gaining permission from the rights holders.

Publisher O&#39;Reilly claimed that content from its books had been used to train some OpenAI models. OpenAI even asked the US government to ensure it had access to any data it wanted to train models, and to block foreign countries from trying to enforce copyright rules against it. ®

It was a rough year for Microsoft’s gaming division, but there are still some great games to check out.﻿

From pervasive layoffs to continued price hikes, things didn’t go so well for Xbox in 2025. But even though Game Pass, the Xbox subscription service, isn’t quite the deal it once was, there are still a lot of excellent titles to check out. This was an especially good year for indie titles, with breakout hits like Blue Prince and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 dominating much of the conversation. Here are the best things to check out right now.

Who the heck knows when Bethesda will finally release the next Elder Scrolls. But in the meantime, Avowed fills in that gap quite nicely. It’s a more contained fantasy RPG in terms of scale, but it’s still pretty big, and features a fascinating world to explore and combat that lets you mix and match with swords, guns, and magic. You can lose yourself in it without giving up all of your free time.

For some people, the idea of a game where you play as a sentient lighthouse solving puzzles in a world devoid of people is probably enough of a sales pitch. For everyone else, let me just say: Keeper is an incredible puzzle-platform game and unlike almost anything else I’ve ever played. Perhaps most impressive is that it’s constantly shifting, so that once you come to grips with its weirdo world, it changes into something new and different.

What really sets this action-adventure game apart is its distinct world. South of Midnight is set in the deep South, and weaves together Black and southern folklore and culture to create the kind of setting you almost never see in video games. On your quest you’ll fight various monsters and creatures in order to heal a blighted landscape, which involves wielding magic powers and partnering with a sentient stuffed toy.

One of the most popular games on Game Pass this year seemingly came out of nowhere. Developed by a brand-new studio called Sandfall Interactive, Clair Obscur is built in the mold of classic Japanese role-playing games like Final Fantasy, but with a distinctly French sense of style. Its mixture of sweeping story, incredible soundtrack, and open-ended combat helped it stand out in a very crowded genre.

More than a decade in the making, Routine is a harsh sci-fi horror game with a very old-school sense of style inspired by the Alien films. That means lots of chunky retrofuturistic gadgets to get your hands on, and a very bleak and terrifying moon base to explore — if you can summon the guts.

The return of the Fallout TV series means there’s a good chance you’ll be looking to explore the post-apocalyptic wasteland in video game form, too. This new edition of Fallout 4 — which first released back in 2015 — brings together the base game and all of the previous DLC, but otherwise mostly leaves the experience intact. As they say, war never changes.

How much time do you have? Because the thing about Blue Prince is that, if it gets its hooks in you, it’s going to be very hard to put down. The architectural puzzle game has you exploring a vast mansion at the same time you build it, all in an attempt to uncover its secrets and find an inheritance you’re owed.

We called this “the feel-good game of the summer,” which should make Wheel World ideal for the gloomy and grey winter months. It’s an open-ended adventure where you bike your way through a fantasy world in order to perform an ancient ritual, which involves assembling a bicycle of legend. Mostly, though, it’s a peaceful way to take in some beautiful sights while speeding down the street.

            <div id="article-text">﻿It was another great year for science fiction.

﻿It was another great year for science fiction.

Apple’s streaming service got a new name this year — it dropped the “plus” and is now just Apple TV — but its actual programming didn’t change all that much. And that’s good news for sci-fi fans, as the service continued to cement itself as the preeminent destination for the genre in the streaming era. This year included new series like Pluribus from Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, as well as the return of favorites like Severance and Foundation. If you’re new to Apple TV, or are just looking for something fresh to watch, here’s the best stuff from (mostly) this year.

Pluribus is like a concept for a Twilight Zone episode that’s been stretched out to encompass an entire TV show. At the core of the show is a virus of unknown origin, which turns much of the Earth’s human population into an interconnected hive mind incapable of negative emotions. One of the “survivors” is Carol (Rhea Seehorn), a successful fantasy author who is also completely miserable most of the time. This creates an ongoing tension with the hive: they just want to make Carol happy, while she wants to set the world back the way it was. Things get weird, and the show offers a delightful (or disturbing) mystery to think about each episode.

After a too-long wait, the office horror story finally returned for its second season this year. It continues the story of “severed” Lumon Industries employees whose psyches have been split in half, essentially turning them into two people: one who exists in the real world, and one who only exists in the eerie basement floor at Lumon, where “the work is mysterious and important.” Season 2 wasn’t afraid to take its time teasing out the story, and while things could get confusing, it ultimately brought all of its disparate threads together in a very satisfying way — while also leaving plenty of questions for next season.

The most epic of Apple’s sci-fi series, Foundation’s century-spanning story returned for season 3. This time around a new wrinkle is introduced in the form of the Mule, a telepathic warlord hellbent on ruling the galaxy. This puts him in direct opposition to the titular Foundation and the current Empire run by a genetic dynasty of clones. Which is all to say, things are very complicated right now.

Most of Apple sci-fi offerings are big, splashy affairs, but Murderbot is a little more humble. An adaptation of Martha Wells’ Murderbot Diaries novels, it follows the titular bot (Alexander Skarsgård) who frees itself from its owners, but isn’t really free at all, because the discovery of its sentience will lead to immediate termination. What follows is a goofy adventure full of existential drama, as Murderbot is forced to hide its true nature from humans, all while dealing with crippling anxiety. It’s very relatable.

An extremely funny takedown of Hollywood, The Studio is absolutely packed with celebrity cameos as it explores the bizarre and confusing nature of the studio system. From the very first episode — which involves a film adaptation of Kool-Aid — the pace never really lets up, making The Studio at times as stressful as it is hilarious.

This nature documentary is a bit like Jurassic Park meets Planet Earth. It has all of the elements of a big-budget doc, from the celebrity voice-over to the incredible shots of various landscapes — except, well, it’s all fake. Instead of a real documentary, it uses the most recent science to imagine what life would have been like for prehistoric creatures. And the latest season shifts the setting to the Ice Age, as told by the soothing voice of Tom Hiddleston.

This video game industry satire wrapped up for good this year, although not without some controversy when it came to the finale. The fourth and final season of Mythic Quest continued to take shots at the game industry, but it also expanded the emotional range of its characters, turning them into more fully fleshed-out people. As a bonus, the spinoff Side Quest was also released this year, growing the world even further.

Okay, this one isn’t totally new, but you’re probably going to want to catch up soon. Season 2 of Monarch is streaming in February, and a lot has happened so far. The show follows the Monarch group, which is a secret organization that deals with Titans, otherwise known as kaiju like Godzilla and King Kong. And it has a nice balance between mystery and all-out action, including a number of very cool run-ins with giant monsters.

Disney Plus made a splash with new entries into its tentpole franchises, while Hulu sprinkled in some much-needed variety.

Disney Plus and Hulu had an eventful year. Not only did the streaming services release a swath of exciting original shows and new seasons, but they’re also in the midst of a transformation that will further integrate Hulu with Disney Plus. The “unified” app experience will have a revamped interface that’s supposed to make it easier to browse through shows and movies from all of its streaming services when it rolls out next year.

For now, though, here’s a list of the best shows from 2025 that you can watch on Disney Plus and Hulu.

Alien: Earth takes place two years before Ridley Scott’s 1979 Alien film. It follows Wendy (Sydney Chandler), a “hybrid” who has had her consciousness transferred into a synthetic body, as she leads a group of soldiers tasked with investigating the crash site of the USCSS Maginot, where they make some disturbing, otherworldly discoveries that shed light on the origins of the xenomorphs.

Disney brought back Andor for a second season, and it’s just as good as the last. The 12-episode season continues to highlight Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and the Rebel Army’s efforts to take down the Galactic Empire, which has only become stronger. Unlike season one, this new season takes place over the course of several years, driving the plot toward the events that unfold in Rogue One.

After almost two decades, King of the Hill has returned, and it introduces an older cast that has changed alongside Arlen, Texas. Following a stint at a propane company in Saudi Arabia, Hank and Peggy Hill settle back into town alongside Boomhauer, Dale, and Bill, while an adult Bobby manages a Japanese-German fusion restaurant in Dallas.

Speaking of animated revivals, Futurama’s comeback is still going strong with season 14, which features 10 episodes filled with the latest in wacky adventures from Fry, Bender, and Leela. I think the logline just about sums it up:

Bender is rampaging out of control! A volcano is about to explode! Fry confronts a rival for Leela’s love! And Dr. Zoidberg is rising up to heaven?! The excitement might be too much!

Ethan Hawke stars as Lee Raybon, an investigative journalist and bookstore owner in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who may have dug too far into his latest story. After publishing an expose on the city’s prominent Washberg family, one of its members, Dale, winds up dead in what appears to be a suicide. But Raybon isn’t taking Dale’s death at face value, launching his own investigation that gets him into a tangled mess with some of the community’s most dangerous people.

If you’re a fan of the classic Spider-Man comic book art style, you might want to check Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man on Disney Plus. The animated series revisits Peter Parker’s journey to becoming the web-slinging superhero, but it introduces some twists, including a new supporting cast and ominously placing Norman Osborn as Parker’s mentor.

This miniseries — set after the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever — follows Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), a young genius with a knack for building armored suits similar to the one worn by Iron Man. After getting expelled from MIT, Williams moves back to her hometown of Chicago, where she comes across a magical criminal organization led by Parker Robbins (Anthony Ramos).

Paradise is a political thriller set inside a Colorado bunker, where only the wealthiest and most powerful individuals reside after a cataclysmic event. US President Cal Bradford (James Marsden) is one of those residents until his suspicious death rocks the upscale community. Secret Service Agent Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown) emerges as an immediate suspect, forcing him to try to uncover what really happened.

Chad Powers is kind of like the Ted Lasso of Hulu. It’s based on a comedy sketch featuring Eli Manning, which had the star player go undercover at Penn State tryouts as “Chad Powers.” But instead of making Manning don a wig and mustache, Hulu tapped Glenn Powell to play Russ Holliday, a disgraced former quarterback who attempts to get a second chance at football by disguising himself as Powers and trying out for the South Georgia Catfish college team.

Daredevil: Born Again picks up years after the original Daredevil series, which was canceled by Netflix in 2018. In this series, Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer with superhuman senses who moonlights as a vigilante known as Daredevil. Though Murdock is hesitant to assume his alter-ego, he steps back into the suit after Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) — also known as Kingpin — becomes the mayor of New York City, waging a war on masked vigilantes, while propping up his own criminal empire.

            <h2>This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

It was researched, designed, and written by human writers, editors, analysts, and illustrators. This includes the writing of surveys and collection of data for surveys. AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here, and you can read more about why it’s time to reset our expectations for AI in the latest edition of the Algorithm, our weekly AI newsletter.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <h2>Is ChatGPT’s New Shopping Research Solving a Problem, or Creating One?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
