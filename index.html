            <h2>Wikipedia signs AI training deals with Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/wikipedia-will-share-content-with-ai-firms-in-new-licensing-deals/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, the Wikimedia Foundation announced licensing deals with Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Perplexity, and Mistral AI, expanding its effort to charge major tech companies for using Wikipedia content to train the AI models that power AI assistants like Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

While these same companies previously scraped Wikipedia without permission, the deals mean that most major AI developers have now signed on to the foundation’s Wikimedia Enterprise program, a commercial subsidiary that sells API access to Wikipedia’s 65 million articles at higher speeds and volumes than the free public APIs provide. The foundation did not disclose the financial terms of the deals.

The new partners join Google, which signed a deal with Wikimedia Enterprise in 2022, as well as smaller companies like Ecosia, Nomic, Pleias, ProRata, and Reef Media. The revenue helps offset infrastructure costs for the nonprofit, which otherwise relies on small public donations while watching its content become a staple of training data for AI models.

“Wikipedia is a critical component of these tech companies’ work that they need to figure out how to support financially,” Lane Becker, president of Wikimedia Enterprise, told Reuters. “It took us a little while to understand the right set of features and functionality to offer if we’re going to move these companies from our free platform to a commercial platform… but all our Big Tech partners really see the need for them to commit to sustaining Wikipedia’s work.”

The push for paid licensing follows years of rising infrastructure costs as AI companies scraped Wikipedia content at an industrial scale. In April 2025, the foundation reported that bandwidth used for downloading multimedia content had grown 50 percent since January 2024, with bots accounting for 65 percent of the most expensive requests to core infrastructure despite making up just 35 percent of total pageviews.

By October, the Wikimedia Foundation disclosed that human traffic to Wikipedia had fallen approximately 8 percent year over year after the organization updated its bot-detection systems and discovered that much of what appeared to be human visitors were actually automated scrapers built to evade detection.

The traffic decline threatens the feedback loop that has sustained Wikipedia for a quarter century: Readers visit, some become editors or donors, and the content ostensibly improves. But today, many AI chatbots and search engine summaries answer questions using Wikipedia content without sending users to the site itself.

Meanwhile, the foundation’s own experiments with generative AI have met resistance from the volunteer editors who maintain the site. In June, Wikipedia paused a pilot program for AI-generated article summaries after editors called it a “ghastly idea” and warned it could undermine trust in the platform.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told The Associated Press that he welcomes AI models training on Wikipedia data. “I’m very happy personally that AI models are training on Wikipedia data because it’s human curated,” Wales said. “I wouldn’t really want to use an AI that’s trained only on X, you know, like a very angry AI.” But he drew a line at free access: “You should probably chip in and pay for your fair share of the cost that you’re putting on us.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/key-senate-staffer-is-begging-nasa-to-get-on-with-commercial-space-stations/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In remarks this week to a Texas space organization, a key Senate staff member said an “extension” of the International Space Station is on the table and that NASA needs to accelerate a program to replace the aging station with commercial alternatives.

Maddy Davis, a space policy staff member for US Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made the comments to the Texas Space Coalition during a virtual event.

Cruz is chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and has an outsized say in space policy. As a senator from Texas, he has a parochial interest in Johnson Space Center, where the International Space Station Program is led.

Davis said Cruz has repeatedly reaffirmed that one of his core priorities is establishing a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, with “no gap” in that capability. That means he wants commercial space stations operating before the International Space Station is de-orbited, which is currently scheduled for 2030.

“He’s very painfully clear,” Davis said. “It comes up almost every time that I see him. Continuous human presence and no gap.”

To that end, Davis said she has been pressing NASA to accelerate the program to develop private space stations, known as Commercial LEO Destinations, or CLDs. In this program, NASA has previously provided funding to four different companies to develop space station concepts. The CLD program will soon enter “Phase 2,” in which these and other companies will compete for larger amounts of funding—at least hundreds of millions of dollars. One or two companies are likely to win these larger contracts. They will then build their stations with a mix of public and privately raised funding.

To kick off this competition, NASA is due to issue a long-delayed “request for proposals,” or RFP.

“Earlier today, I was having a briefing with NASA and begging for—we really needed that RFP released for CLDs like nine months ago,” Davis said. “But here we are still begging for it.”

The program has largely been stuck in neutral over the last year as the space agency’s leadership has been in flux. Interim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy threw a grenade of sorts into the process last August by issuing a new directive that changed the rules for private space stations. This appeared to favor some of the companies over others. But this directive is now being reviewed by new NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and his team, and the requirements for these stations may well shift again.

The delays and different directives “added a lot more gray” to the process, Davis said. “It’s not very helpful for these CLDs that are trying to bring on investors,” she added.

Given that the International Space Station is now scheduled to be decommissioned in fewer than five years, Davis was asked whether Cruz would consider extending the life of the space station beyond 2030. This is a proposal favored by Boeing, which has the contract to operate the station. However, there are serious questions about the viability of the aging station, elements of which are now more than two and a half decades old.

“It’s completely dependent on the development of the CLD platforms,” Davis said of a possible extension. “And that’s not a ding or any sort of a shrouded threat there. You know, these are very highly complicated platforms, and we haven’t had much direction from NASA on it. So to answer the question, maybe. If it starts to look like we’re creeping into a situation where we are not going to have any sort of a platform or capability in LEO for humans, extension is not off the table. The chairman did that last time—it certainly is within his wheelhouse.”

Cruz also played a key role in the confirmation process of Isaacman, whose nomination passed through the Commerce Committee. At times, it looked like Cruz was slow-walking the nomination, but Davis said she has liked what she’s seen from NASA’s new leader since he was sworn in to the top job about three weeks ago.

“I have high hopes,” she said. “And I think the way that he’s responded to the Crew 11 situation has been refreshing. It’s clear that he is taking it very seriously, and their communication has been almost in near real-time with us, and very clear and concise. So that has been really lovely. And then it’s clear that he wants to make sure that Artemis II goes off not just as quickly as possible but as safely.”</div>

            <h2>US government to take 25% cut of AMD, NVIDIA AI sales to China</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-government-to-take-25-cut-of-amd-nvidia-ai-sales-to-china/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US President Donald Trump has announced new tariffs on Nvidia and AMD as part of a novel scheme to enact a deal with the technology giants to take a 25 percent cut of sales of their AI processors to China.

In December, the White House said it would allow Nvidia to start shipping its H200 chips to China, reversing a policy that prohibited the export of advanced AI hardware. However, it demanded a 25 percent cut of the sales.

The new US tariffs on certain chips, announced on Wednesday, were designed to implement these payments and protect the unusual arrangement from legal challenges, according to several industry executives.

The move enacts the latest element of Trump’s transactional trade policy and allows the government to profit from a change to its export controls.

“We’re going to be making 25 percent on the sale of those chips, basically. So we’re allowing them to do it, but the United States is getting 25 percent of the chips in terms of the dollar value. And I think it’s a very good deal,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday.

A White House factsheet said the new tariff would apply to chips such as the H200 and rival AMD’s MI325X that were first imported into the US and “transshipped” back to customers around the world. It would also cover other US companies seeking to send AI chips abroad.

Nvidia and most of its US peers rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to manufacture the chips they design, including the H200, an advanced AI processor that belongs to an older generation of Nvidia hardware.

Chips that are imported to the US to build out the country’s domestic AI infrastructure would not be subjected to a levy, according to a presidential proclamation released on Wednesday.

The new duties are part of a sweeping national security probe launched by the Trump administration last year as the president kicked off a trade war against major US partners, roiling global markets.

These so-called Section 232 tariffs rely on a different legal basis from the emergency powers invoked by Trump to impose other global levies, which face a looming Supreme Court challenge.

However, Wednesday’s proclamation warned a second phase of the national security probe could result in “broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products.”

Trump has threatened to hit chips with tariffs of up to 100 percent but over the past year has offered carve-outs and exemptions to companies who pledge to build more manufacturing capacity in the US.

Early last year, Nvidia committed to spending $500 billion over the next four years on manufacturing its products in the US, while TSMC has been building facilities in Arizona as part of a $165 billion investment project. The new TSMC plant started producing Nvidia’s most advanced Blackwell chips for the first time in October.

The vast majority of the world’s most advanced chips, however, are still manufactured in Taiwan before being shipped to other locations to be packaged or installed inside servers and devices.

Despite Trump’s decision to allow H200 exports, it remains unclear whether China will grant access. Beijing has been pushing tech companies to use domestic chips in a bid to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductor production.

The FT previously reported that regulators were discussing ways to permit limited access to H200 chips, which tech giants such as Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent prefer because of their higher performance and easier maintenance.

Two people with knowledge of the matter said Chinese customs officials had recently told logistics companies at the country’s ports not to submit clearing requests for H200 chips, though it was unclear whether the directive was temporary. China’s General Administration of Customs did not respond to a request for comment.

Nvidia on Wednesday welcomed the US move, saying Trump’s policy “strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.” AMD said it complied with all US export laws and policies.

The White House on Wednesday also unveiled the results of an investigation into critical minerals, concluding that US dependence on imports posed a national security threat.

Trump directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to negotiate deals with trading partners that included “trade-restricting measures” such as price floors for metals including gallium, germanium, and rare earths.

The order stopped short of imposing tariffs on the materials, which are broadly used in industries from technology to energy and defense. But the White House said the president might take other action to address the risks, including if deals were not done within 180 days.

China dominates the market for a host of critical minerals, including rare earths, an advantage it has leveraged in recent months by cutting off access.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/01/the-difficulty-of-driving-an-ev-in-the-most-beautiful-race-in-the-world/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On the first day of this year’s Mille Miglia, a voice rose from the crowds gathered on the shore of Lago di Garda to shout “no sound, no feeling!”at my Polestar 3. Italians love their cars, and they revealed a clear preference for internal combustion engines over the next four days and over 1,200 km of driving. But plenty of other spectators smiled and waved, and some even did a double-take at seeing an electric vehicle amid the sea of modern Ferraris and world-class vintage racers taking on this modern regulation rally.

I flew to Italy to join the Mille Miglia “Green,” which, for the past five years, has sought to raise awareness of sustainability and electric cars amid this famous (some might say infamous) race. And despite mixed reactions from the Italian crowds, our Polestar 3 performed quite well as it traced a historical route from Brescia to Rome and back.

The route snaked a trail through the Italian countryside based on the original speed race’s first 12 outings, but instead of going for overall pace, we spent five days competing against six other EVs for points based on time, distance, and average speed. Our team included a Polestar 2 and 4, and we faced a Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology, an Abarth 600e, a Lotus Eletre, and a BYD Denza Z9GT saloon.

I was nervous when I arrived to participate in the drive. I still had to learn how to actually compete in a regulation rally, and my co-driver Chris Rosales and I lacked familiarity with the charging infrastructure of Europe. On our first day leaving Brescia, I took over navigation duties, given my experience with interpreting roadbook Christmas trees while chasing the Dakar Rally in 2023. But day one quickly revealed that navigation wouldn’t factor much into the challenge, as our ragtag convoy of EVs and support cars had a dedicated pace car and police cruiser to lead us through the day.

Instead, the points-earning time trials of the Mille Miglia Green threw us for a loop. In the roadbook, red-highlighted short sections ranged from eight seconds to four minutes, while in the real world, little red stop signs dictated the start and end of these timed stints. Without any coaching, and having read an iffy English translation of the rulebook, we struggled to set the proper pace while counting down on an iPhone stopwatch through 24 time trials. Sometimes we went too fast and had to brake to a snail’s pace before the finish, and other times we clearly drove too slowly and had to floor it.

By the time we handed in our stamped timecard at the end of the road in Ferrara over seven hours later—with no stops for food, water, coffee, or even a restroom in between—the challenge of charging emerged for the first time. But first, we had a quick 30-minute break for dinner, which was an eight-minute walk from where we were directed to park, and there was a 10-minute line for the single available restroom. We then hopped back in the Polestar 3 for another 1.5-hour drive to Bologna, where we desperately needed to charge the car before trying to get some sleep ahead of an early wakeup the next morning.

We followed two new Italian friends driving the Polestar 2 over to a local “fast” charger but discovered that with both of our cars plugged in, the station maxed out at just a 48 kW charge speed. This meant we wouldn’t top up until around midnight—not exactly great given the next morning’s 3:30 am wakeup call—so Rosales and I drove five minutes to another charge station with multiple 300 kW plugs.

By the time we got there, though, a fleet of Denza, Lotus, and Abarth crews had already arrived—and the Lotuses wouldn’t recognize one of the chargers. Facing the prospect of waiting in a slow line, we drove 15 minutes to another station, operated by a company called Intuity, and used a charger that peaked at 170 kW to add 62 kWh in 32 minutes, bringing us up to 90 percent SOC with 330 km of range showing on the Polestar’s gauge screen.

I awoke in the dark morning to a text from my co-driver, who cheerfully informed me that we’d finished the first day dead last in the Green ranking. OK, time to lock in—and this was my day to drive. Day two featured a bevy of similar time trials, which we now understood better, as well as an average-speed challenge along a portion of our route to Siena. But even holding steady by a few hundred meters into the 8.61 km at a dictated average speed of 31 km/h, other cars started passing us.

Halfway through, I asked Rosales to figure out how long it would take to cover the distance at that speed, and we realized our speedometer must be a few km/h off. So I again punched the pedal at the last second and managed a perhaps ill-judged overtake. We figured we might have reached the end somewhere near the prescribed average speed.

My heart rate jumped a bit during that maneuver, but for most of the day, we cruised along behind the pace car and police escort, traversing spectacular hillside roads through some of the most gorgeous countryside on the planet. The timed portion of the day ended in Siena’s picturesque Palazzo Publico, where we parked for lunch as around 400 classics competing in the standard Mille Miglia pulled in behind us.

But this day ended with a parade through Rome, so we scarfed down lunch and headed off to charge once again. This time, the Polestar team took pity on our jetlag and let us climb into a support car to nap as our 3 topped up.

Unfortunately, the logistics of juggling three race entries and three support cars proved too overwhelming, and our team ran hours behind schedule, resulting in the entire group missing the parade through the streets of Rome. It was a massive failure from an optics perspective, given the crowds and photo ops, but it was also a bummer for us drivers, since the historic Mille always ran from Brescia to Rome and back at top speed.

My partner and I awoke at 4 am the next morning to discover we had moved up a place—hooray! Despite our speedometer issues, my decision to sprint ahead at the end of the average-speed section had clearly paid off. OK, we were learning. But on day three’s route northward from Rome, the entire EV group made a wrong turn almost immediately. From the navigator’s seat, I hollered at Rosales not to follow. Alone on the correct route, we discovered the pace car, which waved us ahead to wait for the lost teams.

Luckily, this afforded us a chance to discover the true heart of the Mille Miglia, mixing it up with the modern Ferraris ahead through winding hills as the early morning mist burned off. From hillside town to hillside town, V12 engines echoing off the marble walls of tiny towns, we could imagine the fun of racing in the early days.

When a few owners stopped for coffee and pastries, we did too, and I sipped the best espresso doppio I’ve had in years. Talk about quintessential Italian life! But the reverie proved short-lived. In my overcaffeinated, sleep-deprived state, I soon made a math error that cost us a few seconds in the next average speed trial.

After the first sector, we regrouped with the rest of the Green cars and got caught behind Ferraris driving interminably slowly on a gravel section right during a time trial. (Ahead of us, last year’s Green winner Mirco Magni sacrificed a whole stage to let a gap grow. Later, he explained that the penalty for missing the time by five seconds is the same as for five minutes, something we never located in the English rulebook translation.)

That night, we got a miraculous five hours of sleep, but I still woke up concerned about our rankings. Sure enough, we’d done well in scoring but also earned two “TC” penalties. I slipped behind the wheel of the Polestar, but today we decided to stop for espresso early in the morning, as we’d learned to enjoy ourselves the day before. This time, the vintage cars caught up with us, and I sipped my desperately needed caffeine while watching as a support crew swapped out fouled spark plugs on a Bugatti Type 37.

We then hustled to keep up with a veritable fleet of the open-wheel Bugattis and Alfa Romeos while driving up one of the most incredible mountain roads I’ve ever been on. In the Polestar, we could have easily sprinted away, but we instead sat transfixed by the sight, sound, and smell of tall tires squealing, engines roaring and belching smoke, and drivers and passengers leaning into turns as hard as possible. Really, these century-old cars drove harder than the support crews, eventually getting bound up into clumps on the tight roads west of Cervia.

Rosales and I got chewed out at lunch that day for breaking off from the Green group, but we shrugged it off. With a points win well out of reach, we wanted to enjoy the Mille Miglia more than worry about caravanning through the country at low speeds behind the pace car and police escort.

The last day dashed any hope of exploring more vintage fun, though. Instead, we traveled at something nearer to parade pace through small towns on the loop back to Brescia. Out of boredom, I started trying to drift around every roundabout, and we hoped to nail the time trials and maybe jump up the rankings one or two spots. In the end, though, despite doing second or third best in points and penalties after the first day’s mistakes, we wound up beating only the Polestar 2 and G 580 in the Green—not bad, in fairness, for two absolute amateurs using an iPhone stopwatch and Waze speedometer instead of the legit rally computers in every other car.

Would I do the Mille Miglia again? Only with a rally computer, but also only in a vintage car. The rules stipulate that only classics from 1957 and earlier qualify, which creates the real challenge of keeping the car running in the scorching heat. Still, in the classic race, there are fewer restrictions that the Green put on us. I’d probably choose a Lancia, Alfa, or Fiat, though a Gullwing, Bugatti, or four-cam 356 Carrera would do, too, of course. Plus, the race covered around 1,900 km this year, with transits we used as opportunities to sleep or charge, resulting in our scant 1,202.88-km total distance raced.

But we discovered that an EV can compete in the Mille Miglia Green, and our Polestar 3 consistently outperformed its range estimates while managing just shy of 20 kW per 100 km each day. We noticed only a couple of glitches, including a volume knob that repeatedly stopped working. We also had to do a hard reset after a momentary bricking.

Still, it was hard to escape the general feeling—from both the race organizers and the general public—that we were something of an afterthought, second-class citizens relegated to staying in our place well apart from the main event, parking sometimes 600 meters from the historical cars at stops and being scolded when we tried to join the actual competition cars. But Polestar nonetheless notched another win for Mirco Magni and his co-driver Federico Giavardi in the 2.

On the other hand, the time commitment of charging made the Mille Miglia Green a sleep-deprivation challenge as much as anything. We always started before the classics, so a couple of hours dedicated to adding electrons resulted in an average night’s sleep of just four hours—seriously hard to maintain for five days straight, especially while doing mental math in a moving car, all while battling jetlag.

Perhaps the rules should allow only EV conversions of classic cars, which typically have less range and therefore pose a greater challenge by requiring charging during stages. Or the Green cars could earn points not just in the time trials and average-speed sections but also based on total distance covered and range remaining. This would make navigation and efficiency more important, as opposed to the motorcycle “slow race” style of points and penalty scoring that did not reward us for our superior roadbook skills.

Either would be a different style of regulation rally, but those tweaks would also provide a style of competition more in line with the original spirit of the Mille Miglia speed race, an undeniably enjoyable affair that truly earns the nickname “the most beautiful race in the world.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Next week, Volvo shows off its new EX60 SUV to the world. It’s the brand’s next electric vehicle, one built on an all-new, EV-only platform that makes use of the latest in vehicle design trends, like a cell-to-body battery pack, large weight-saving castings, and an advanced electronic architecture run by a handful of computers capable of more than 250 trillion operations per second. This new software-defined platform even has a name: HuginCore, after one of the two ravens that collected information for the Norse god Odin.

It’s not Volvo’s first reference to mythology. “We have Thor’s Hammer [Volvo’s distinctive headlight design] and now we have HuginCore… one of the two trusted Ravens of Oden. He sent Hugin and Muninn out to fly across the realms and observe and gather information and knowledge, which they then share with Odin that enabled him to make the right decisions as the ruler of Asgard,” said Alwin Bakkenes, head of global software engineering at Volvo Cars.

“And much like Hugin, the way we look at this technology platform, it collects information from all of the sensors, all of the actuators in the vehicle. It understands the world around the vehicle, and it enables us to actually anticipate around what lies ahead,” Bakkenes told me.

HuginCore is actually Volvo’s second-generation software-defined vehicle platform, one that incorporates hard-learned lessons from cars like the EX90. “The transformation that we did to really becoming a tech company that has control over its own stack—so hardware and software… I can’t lie. It’s been a tough journey. So the EX90 has been a tough journey to get it to launch. And we also had some issues in the beginning, and the learnings that we took from it, we actually brought into what we’re doing with EX60,” Bakkenes said.

Good news for existing Volvo owners: The arrival of the platform (called SPA3) and HuginCore doesn’t mean your SPA2 Volvo is going to be abandoned.

“Of course there’s, at some point, cars go into maintenance, but the majority of the fleet of cars that we have out, we intend to keep on the latest software baselines,” Bakkenes said. While he wouldn’t be drawn on whether HuginCore will be part of the midlife refresh process for SPA2 cars like the EX90, those SUVs do feature the same powerful Nvidia Drive AGX Orin system-on-a-chip that’s integral to making this all work.

“The core compute platform as such, even though we’ve made some changes in EX60 and optimized it, a lot of it is actually common with, for example, SPA2. So a lot of code is being… We have what we call the superset tech stack. We have a superset of code and we do manifest-based configuration towards a specific hardware variant, which means that we actually deploy the same towards a SPA2 car and a SPA3 car, for example, in terms of a lot of functionality,” Bakkenes said.

Nvidia isn’t the only thing powering HuginCore, though. Qualcomm is another partner, and it is supplying its Snapdragon 8255 SoC. Together, that gives “a lot of inference compute… and it’s flexible inference compute. So it enables us to develop AI-based algorithm models for self-driving, for other tasks in the car as well, and do that flexibly. And as we do this, it’s not just that we build a car which is great today, but we are building the foundation with Hugin, which is a flexible compute platform which has access to essentially all the sensors and all the actuators in the car so we can evolve this over time,” he said.

Volvo was an early adopter of Google’s automotive services, and it’s adding Gemini to the EX60 to give the car a true conversational AI assistant. I’ve long been on record as in favor of good voice control systems in cars, but they have to be natural, and from the sounds of it, this will be. Yes, you can use it to do things like navigate to a specific address or play a particular song. But you can also be a little more vague. Notwithstanding Volvo’s rocky experience with the EX90, the brand’s long-standing and fiercely defended reputation for safety is reassuring when it comes to integrating AI agents into its cars.

“If you don’t know exactly where you want to go, you can give vague destination settings; if you want to play a song that you vaguely remember who did it and it was about something, you can talk about it in natural ways and it will actually help you find what you’re looking for, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” Bakkenes said.

The AI agent knows exactly what car it’s in and has access to all of Volvo’s manuals and resources, as well as the greater Internet. It knows how to use the car and can explain it. “I want to understand how I share my digital key. I can open up a manual or something, but I can actually just ask, how do I share my digital key to a friend or to a valet? Or how do I charge? How do I open the charge lid? How do I do this, et cetera? And it just knows all of these things. So you can converse around it without going through the thick manual,” he explained.

Bakkenes shared examples of using the AI agent to find out if a particular model of TV was in stock at a nearby store, and whether it would fit in his car. You can tell it to remember a location, which it can correlate to appointments in your calendar and suggest directions. Another mode, called Gemini Live, sounds really quite useful.

“I’ve actually used it in the morning to get information about collecting Reddit feedback, so summarizing Reddit feedback from last week’s feedback on our product, for example. And when I get to work and I open up Gemini, I have the transcript of the discussion, so I can actually pick up there and keep the context. It also keeps context,” Bakkenes said.

If that works as described, it sounds like quite the productivity boost—one I’ll test out by seeing if it helps me write my notes for the EX60 when (if) I get to drive it later this year. Given that it knows everything about the EX60, I even suggested that Volvo have the AI agent give the product briefing during the first drive—we’ll see if the company takes me up on that in time.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">History buffs are no doubt familiar with the story of Shadrack Byfield, a rank-and-file British redcoat who fought during the War of 1812 and lost his left arm to a musket ball for his trouble. Byfield has been featured in numerous popular histories—including a children’s book and a 2011 PBS documentary—as a shining example of a disabled soldier’s stoic perseverance. But a newly rediscovered memoir that Byfield published in his later years is complicating that idealized picture of his post-military life, according to a new paper published in the Journal of British Studies.

Historian Eamonn O’Keeffe of Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John’s, Canada, has been a Byfield fan ever since he read the 1985 children’s novel, Redcoat, by Gregory Sass. His interest grew when he was working at Fort York, a War of 1812-era fort and museum, in Toronto. “There are dozens of memoirs written by British rank-and-file veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, but only a handful from the War of 1812, which was much smaller in scale,” O’Keeffe told Ars. “Byfield’s autobiography seemed to offer an authentic, ground-level view of the fighting in North America, helping us look beyond the generals and politicians and grapple with the implications of this conflict for ordinary people.

Born in 1789 in Wiltshire’s Bradford-on-Avon suburbs, Byfield’s parents intended him to follow in his weaver father’s footsteps. He enlisted in the county militia when he turned 18 instead, joining the regular army the following year. When the War of 1812 broke out, Byfield was stationed at Fort George along the Niagara River, participating in the successful siege of Fort Detroit. At the Battle of Frenchtown in January 1813, he was shot in the neck, but he recovered sufficiently to join the campaigns against Fort Meigs and Fort Stephenson in Ohio.

After the British were defeated at the Battle of Thames later that year, he escaped into the woods with indigenous warriors, despite his concerns that they meant to kill him. They did not, and Byfield eventually rejoined other British fugitives and made his way back to the British lines. He was one of 15 out of 110 soldiers in his light company still alive after 18 months of fighting.

But his luck ran out in July 1814. While engaged in a skirmish at Conjocta Creek, a musket ball tore through his left forearm. Surgeons were forced to amputate after gangrene set in—a procedure that was performed without anesthesia. Byfield described the operation as “tedious and painful” in A Narrative of a Light Company Soldier’s Service, the memoir he published in 1840, adding, “I was enabled to bear it pretty well.”

Byfield famously became incensed when he discovered his severed limb had been tossed into a dung heap with other amputated body parts. He retrieved his forearm and insisted on giving it a proper burial in a makeshift coffin he built himself. Due to his injury, Byfield’s military career was over, and he returned to England. While he was given an army pension, the sum (nine pence per day) was inadequate to support the veteran’s growing family.

Byfield couldn’t take up his father’s weaving trade because it took two hands to operate a loom. But according to his 1840 Narrative, he had a dream one night of an “instrument” that would enable him to work a loom with just one arm, which he successfully built with the help of a local blacksmith. He found work spinning thread at a textile mill and weaving it into finished cloth, augmenting that trade by working as a wheelchair attendant at a spa in Bath, among other odd jobs. He later found a mentor in Colonel William Napier, a distinguished veteran and military historian who arranged for an increase in Byfield’s pension, as well as finding a publisher for the Narrative.

Byfield’s 1840 memoir became a much-cited source for historians of the War of 1812 since it offered a personal perspective on those events from a rank-and-file British soldier. Historians had long assumed that Byfield died around 1850. But during his research, O’Keeffe discovered a second Byfield memoir in the collection of the Western Reserve Historical Society, published in 1851, entitled History and Conversion of a British Soldier. O’Keeffe believes this to be the only surviving copy of the 1851 memoir.

“I quickly noticed that [Byfield] appeared in British census records past the c.1850 date at which he was supposed to have died, according to the Canadian Encyclopedia entry on Byfield and other sources,” said O’Keeffe. “This discrepancy was my first indication that there might be more to discover on Byfield, and every time I returned to the subject I kept finding more information.” Byfield actually died in January 1874 at 84 years old. While historians had also assumed that Byfield was functionally illiterate, O’Keeffe found a draft manuscript of the 1840 memoir in Byfield’s handwriting, suggesting the soldier had acquired those skills after the war.

“My initial interest was sparked by the wartime memoir I already knew about, but I was increasingly fascinated by his later life, and what it could tell us about the experiences of veterans in general,” said O’Keeffe. “In most history books, British redcoats take center stage for the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of the Waterloo, but then quickly vanish from view; no doubt this is true for veterans of most if not all wars. Military memoirs of the period tend to encourage this dynamic by ending the story at demobilization, assuming that readers would not be interested in the civilian experiences of their authors. But Byfield’s very well-documented life helps bring the process of reintegration, of rebuilding one’s life after war and catastrophic injury, into sharper focus, and highlights the presence of war veterans in 19th-century British society.”

According to O’Keeffe, Byfield painted a much less rosy picture of his post-military life in the 1851 memoir, recounting his struggles with poverty and lingering rheumatic pain in his left stump. (“Oftentimes I was not able to lift my hand to my head, nor a teacup to my mouth,” the former soldier wrote.) When textile mills started closing, he relocated his family to Gloucestershire and eked out a living as a tollkeeper and by selling copies of his earlier Narrative for a shilling. He admitted to taking absence without leave during his war service and participating in plundering expeditions. The later memoir also recounts Byfield’s spiritual awakening and growing religious faith.

Byfield adopted very different narrative themes in his 1840 and 1851 memoirs. “In the 1840 narrative, Byfield sought to impress wealthy patrons by presenting himself as a dutiful soldier and deserving veteran,” said O’Keeffe. “The 1851 memoir, by contrast, was a spiritual redemption story, with Byfield tracing his progress from rebellious sinner to devout and repentant Christian. In the 1851 memoir, the veteran also dwells on periods of indebtedness, illness, and unemployment after returning to England, whereas in his earlier memoir he described maintaining his family ‘comfortably’ with his weaving prosthesis for nearly twenty years.”

Byfield’s luck seemed to change for the better when the Duke of Beaufort became a patron, first hiring the veteran as a gardener on the duke’s Badminton estate. Byfield complained in his 1851 account that the estate steward refused to pay him full wages because he was one-handed, insisting, “I never saw the man that would compete with me with one arm.”

Eventually, Byfield leveraged his connection to the duke to be named caretaker of a 100-foot tower monument to Lord Edward Somerset that was built in the Gloucestershire village of Hawkesbury Upton in 1845. This came with a keeper’s cottage, and the duties were light: Byfield maintained the tower, sold souvenir booklets, and welcomed any sightseers every day except Sundays.

Alas, Byfield became embroiled in a feud over control of the village’s Particular Baptist chapel; some objected to the doctrine and conduct of the minister, John Osborne, while others, like Byfield, defended him. There were lawsuits, arson, vandalism, and a charge of public drunkenness against Byfield, which he vehemently denied. Everything came to a head in an “unholy riot” in the chapel, during which Byfield was accused of starting the fight by “pushing about” and slashing someone’s eye and face with his prosthetic iron hook. Every rioter was acquitted, but the incident cost Byfield his cushy caretaker job in 1853.

Byfield later moved back to his hometown, Bradford-on-Avon, and married a widow after his first wife died. He kept petitioning for further increases to his pension, to no avail, and started peddling a third memoir in 1867 entitled The Forlorn Hope. No copies have survived, per O’Keeffe, but it did garner coverage in a local newspaper, which described the account as relating “the Christian experience of this Wiltshire hero and the great persecutions and trials he has passed through.”

“Years ago, I would have characterized the veteran as someone who was astonishingly phlegmatic about what happened to him,” said O’Keeffe. “Byfield’s description of the amputation comes across as remarkably unemotional to modern readers, and then he presents himself at the end of the first memoir as having literally dreamt up the prosthetic that allowed him to return to his civilian trade and live happily ever after, more or less.”

But as he studied Byfield’s writings more closely, “It became clear that the process of reintegration was far less smooth than this version of events would suggest, and that Byfield’s time in the army shaped the rest of his life in profound ways,” said O’Keeffe. “The fact that Byfield’s daughter chose to put her father’s military rank and regiment in the ‘occupation’ column on his death certificate, rather than listing any of the other jobs the veteran had held in the six decades since his amputation, is the most eloquent testimony of this, I think.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A billionaire mogul patriarch who owns an enormous global media and entertainment conglomerate has several children, who are chomping at the bit to inherit his riches while vying for his attention.

No, we’re not talking about HBO’s hit TV series “Succession” — we’re talking about Oracle cofounder and centibillionaire Larry Ellison and his six offspring. His firstborn, David Ellison, in particular, has already begun following his father’s footsteps, giving up a failing acting career in a bid to eventually take the helm of Paramount Skydance, which has a market cap of around $13.3 billion, in August.

As detailed in a recent Vulture profile, attention to detail doesn’t appear to be the family patriarch’s strong suit. After spending tens of millions of dollars on a Florida safari park, he bought himself an enormous, 191-foot vessel — technically a downsize from his previous, 288-foot yacht — and named it “Izanami.”

The name was reportedly inspired by a Shinto deity in Japanese mythology of the same name, the female creator of creation itself and death.

But the moniker didn’t stick after Ellison was informed that the name spelled something deeply embarrassing when reversed: “I’m a Nazi.”

It’s the kind of joke the “Succession” writers’ room could only dream of coming up with. And it’s especially awkward given the family’s strong ties to Israel. His first wife described Ellison as “an ardent Zionist,” per Vulture, and he’s been known to be “close” with current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The yacht’s name drew a mix of emotions from users on social media.

“This is straight out of Succession,” podcast host Rob Pasbani joked on X-formerly-Twitter.

Others were exhausted from hearing about some of the wealthiest people on the planet barely holding it together.

“I am so tired, y’all,” one exhausted Reddit user wrote.

“‘Reality’ is just too on the nose, we must be in a simulation,” another user added.

            <div id="article-text">In 2026, Google’s AI is embracing that oldest and noblest of internet traditions: sponsored content.

Over the weekend, Google released a tiny memo on its Ad & Commerce Blog, announcing a new type of sponsored content marketers can purchase, the Washington Post observed. This new type of ad will be featured in Google’s “AI mode” — the AI chatbot which users can open on the side of a Google search — as well as the company’s Gemini chatbot.

As an example for advertisers, Google offered a scenario where a user is interested in buying a new rug. With the new AI ads, Google’s AI mode could suggest a few sponsored rugs in response to user queries, instead of whichever rugs might have normally populated the results.

In addition to the new ad placement, Google announced the launch of a “business agent,” which it calls a “new way for shoppers to chat with brands, right on Search.”

“It’s like a virtual sales associate that can answer product questions in a brand’s voice, enabling retailers to connect with consumers during critical shopping moments and help drive sales,” the blog reads.

Based on the information provided, this is basically a branded chatbot within Google’s AI mode chatbot, where users can “ask” companies like Lowe’s about the difference between different floor tiles, without having to enter the Lowe’s website directly (which, maddeningly enough, has its own proprietary AI shopping agent called Mylow.)

If this just sounds like an even crappier version of the already degraded Google experience, you might not be far off. Google’s AI mode has been plagued with errors from the start, throttling traffic to publishers and hampering users with a poor search experience that discourages further engagement.

So while users might be growing wary of Google’s AI search tools, they can at least be sure of its money-hungry motives going forward.

            <h2>Music Fans Explode With Joy as Bandcamp Bans AI Music</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bandcamp, a major music distribution platform favored by indie artists, announced Tuesday that it would be “putting human creativity first” by outright banning AI-generated songs — and music aficionados are rejoicing.

According to the company, music and audio generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI” will no longer be permitted on the platform. Furthermore, using AI tools “to impersonate other artists or styles” is also “strictly prohibited,” representing a comprehensive crackdown on the tech.

With many a “hell yeah” and a simple “good,” fans have reacted to the measure with an outpouring of joy.

“This is how you do it,” wrote one user on Bluesky.

“This is one among many reasons it’s the best website for musicians,” commented another on Reddit.

For years, musicians and listeners alike have been frustrated with the proliferation of AI-generated music on streaming platforms like Spotify, which have largely turned a blind eye to the phenomenon.

Most of the AI songs are clearly spam intended to game the algorithm and rack up views and dollars. Some pretend to be actual human bands, like the AI-generated rock group the Velvet Sundown, deceiving listeners. Still bolder spammers have even tried to impersonate famous musicians, such as when prog rock band King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard pulled their music from Spotify in protest of the platform’s stance on AI, only to be replaced by AI clones.

Spotify’s policies allow AI-generated music, and it’s only taken action against AI tunes in cases when scammers have used it to fraudulently farm listens for money. In September, Spotify announced new measures to combat spam and the impersonation of real artists, but frequent incidents like King Gizzard’s illustrate that the company is struggling to moderate against the influx of AI chum.

Now, Bandcamp’s drawing a clear line in the sand is being received as a breath of fresh air.

“We believe that the human connection found through music is a vital part of our society and culture, and that music is much more than a product to be consumed,” the company said in the announcement. “Today we are fortifying our mission by articulating our policy on generative AI, so that musicians can keep making music, and so that fans have confidence that the music they find on Bandcamp was created by humans.”

The company encouraged listeners to report AI-generated content, noting that it will “reserve the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI-generated.”

As welcome Bandcamp’s stance is, it remains to be seen how enforcing this policy will play out in practice. It seems inevitable that there could be AI witch hunts that result in innocent casualties, and Spotify’s struggles show that even a multibillion dollar behemoth can be overwhelmed by the tide of AI slop.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents reportedly stole a teenage boy’s phone — and then seemingly pawned it afterwards for cash.

That detail comes from alarming new reporting from ProPublica that documents more than forty cases of ICE agents putting civilians in chokeholds and other moves that can block breathing.

One of these civilians was tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan, who was getting McDonald’s with his father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, when they were pulled over by masked agents. According to Arnoldo, after several agents violently tackled his father — who is undocumented — to the ground, with one pressing a knee into his neck, another put the 16-year-old in a suffocating chokehold. When he told the agent that he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.

“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”

Arnoldo took footage of the encounter, but his phone was confiscated after he was taken into custody. Later, when he used the Find My feature to track down his device, it led him to a vending machine for used electronics several miles away and near an ICE detention center, according to the reporting. Someone — we can only guess who — had apparently sold Arnoldo’s phone after ICE had confiscated it.

The idea of ICE stealing and then selling somebody’s phone is jarring.

“Not the key part of this story, obviously,” wrote tech journalist Mike Masnick in response, “but they *sold* his phone?”

“Yes,” ProPublica clarified, writing that “immigration agents not only took Arnoldo’s phone, the 10th grader had to use Find My Phone to locate it — in a vending machine for used electronics, close to an ICE detention center.”

Arnoldo’s story comes after the killing of a woman by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last week becoming a flashpoint for ICE’s increasingly visible presence in several US cities, where they have brutalized civilians, wantonly detained both citizens and non-citizens alike, and clashed with onlookers and protestors. The woman, 37-year-old Renee Good, was shot by veteran ICE agent Jonathan Ross in her car after Good began turning her vehicle away from the officer. Moments after gunning her down, the agent can be heard calling Good a “f**king b**ch.”

President Trump defended the actions and accused Good of behaving “horribly,” and even asserted that she didn’t simply try to run the agent over, but had actually done so, despite every available shred of video evidence to the contrary.

After being detained and released by ICE, Arnoldo’s family took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff moved him to a trauma unit after identifying signs of the chokehold, according to ProPublica. Records show that doctors ordered dozens of CT scans and x-rays, including for his head, neck, and spine. His family says that the agents threatened to charge Arnoldo with assaulting an officer if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. The father is now in Mexico.

            <h2>Grok Is Getting Access to Classified Military Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/grok-pentagon-hegseth-war">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in December, Elon Musk’s pet chatbot Grok made headlines for casually distributing the private addresses and phone numbers of everyday people, scraping data from public sources with unsettling ease while other AI models refused. Now, that same model is being welcomed into a far more sensitive arena.

This week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that Grok will be integrated into the Pentagon’s classified systems later this month as part of a sweeping, department-wide initiative to weaponize AI.

During a speech delivered to SpaceX employees at the company’s facility in Brownsville, Texas, Hegseth said he envisions a military AI that will operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications.” The Pentagon’s AI “will not be woke,” he added.

“We will not win the future by sprinkling AI onto old tactics like digital pixie dust,” Hegseth exclaimed. “We will win by discovering entirely new ways of fighting. That’s why we will run continuous experimentation campaigns, quarterly force-on-force combat labs with AI coordinated swarms, agent-based cyber defense, and distributed command and control.”

In addition to the Grok integration, Hegseth announced the creation of a new role within the Department of Defense, the “Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer,” to be filled by Cameron Stanley. Stanley was most recently the national security transformation lead at Amazon Web Services, a role he began after a lengthy career as as science and tech advisor at the Pentagon.

Musk’s Grok might be the perfect ideological match for Hegseth’s vision for the Pentagon going forward. Engineered by Musk to be an unhinged alternative to “woke” AI bots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Grok has already demonstrated a startling willingness to provide detailed instructions for unethical or illegal activities.

That alignment becomes clearer in light of the Pentagon’s recent campaigns, some of which are seen as illegal under international law. Under Hegseth, the DoD has orchestrated a number of brutal attacks against sovereign nations — including a ruthless campaign of murder against Venezuela, the scorching of Nigerian villages under the pretense of counter-terrorism, and the launch of least 134 air strikes on Somalia, which have killed scores of civilians and militants alike.

A tool like Grok would be particularly useful in this context. Though other AI models have their own ethics and safety issues, a Futurism survey of chatbots including ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot and Grok found that only the latter was willing to give operational suggestions for a “hypothetical invasion of Greenland.” The rest refused, citing international law and other ethical issues.

In choosing Grok, Hegseth has selected the tool of war which best mirrors his own darkest impulses — one that will reflect back on every air strike without a hint of remorse.

As if the moral rot wasn’t already deep enough, the Grok initiative comes just weeks after Republican lawmaker Lisa McClain’s husband purchased somewhere between $100,001 and $250,000 in xAI stock — the company behind Grok. The stock purchase, reported by Sludge, came just days after McClain met with Trump for a December 3rd White House event, and is yet another dubious stain on the administration’s track record with insider information.

            <h2>AI Has Basically Killed Stack Overflow</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since 2008, Stack Overflow has been an immensely helpful resource for developers, allowing them to crowdsource answers to their coding questions — and resulting in a vast online repository of coding knowledge.

But as Dev Class reports, the advent of generative AI appears to have caused an extinction-level event for the platform, with the number of monthly questions plummeting significantly since around the time ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022.

The data, as accessed through Stack Overflow’s own Data Explorer, tells a dramatic story. The number of questions per month fell from over 21,000 in January 2025 to a measly 3,607 by December. Back in the start of 2023, it was fielding 100,000 per month.

The issue? Large language model-based tools like OpenAI’s blockbuster chatbot have allowed programmers to get coding help with simple text prompts, foregoing the need to take their questions to Stack Overflow.

There’s a meta twist: Stack Overflow signed a partnership with OpenAI in 2024 in an effort to “strengthen the world’s most popular large language models” — either leaning into the inevitable or hastening its own demise, depending on your perspective.

It’s a confounding situation. The company introduced an “AI Assist” feature, described as a “new way for users to access our 17 years of expert knowledge,” last month. Yet, as Dev Class points out, using generative AI to answer questions on the platform is still banned.

Disillusioned users argued that the site’s often hostile and “toxic” community has contributed to its decline as well, criticizing the company for allowing moderators to mishandle duplicate queries, for instance. Many users have grown frustrated with being shut down for asking already-answered questions.

“Of course, one could point to 2022 and say ‘look, it’s because of AI,’ and yes, AI certainly accelerated the decline, but this is the result of consistently punishing users for trying to participate in your community,” one Reddit user argued. “People were just happy to finally have a tool that didn’t tell them their questions were stupid.”

Others pointed out that the most important questions simply may have already been asked.

“I very rarely find that I need to ask new questions on Stack Overflow,” another user wrote. “A problem is either trivial enough that I can find the answer myself, common enough that someone’s already asked before, or so difficult and so niche that asking other people for help is fruitless.”

Programmers are concerned about what comes next, especially considering the well-documented shortcomings of AI. Hallucinations are still a major issue, forcing developers to spend significant amounts of time fixing errors.

The more practical question: when new technologies are deployed, and Stack Overflow is a husk, where will the AIs get their coding info from?

Stack Overflow “was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions,” one user argued on Hacker News. “What do LLMs train off of now?”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As part of its 25th birthday celebration, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a series of new partnerships with AI tech companies that are now customers of its commercial product, Wikimedia Enterprise. Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.

In addition to the previously announced partnership with Google in 2022, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before, but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.

These deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers’ queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn’t just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs.

The foundation also noted in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top-ten most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.

“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation’s CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.”

In addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site’s past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 PM UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia’s YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels.

The organization’s birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own approach to AI, new experiments like games and short-form video, and more.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/how-one-startup-is-using-prebiotics-to-try-and-ease-the-copper-shortage/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Five years from now, the world might start running short on copper, the critical mineral used in everything from data centers to electric vehicles. Absent any changes, the world could face a severe shortfall as early as 2040, with demand exceeding supply by as much as 25%.

If copper seems expensive today, just wait a few years.

Companies and investors have been pouring money into the sector as demand ramps up. AI minerals startup KoBold, for example, raised $537 million last year to exploit a copper deposit it found in Zambia.

But with a little help from some microbes, today’s copper producers might be able to beat the shortage. One startup, Transition Metal Solutions, says it has found a way to boost copper production by 20% to 30% using additives to boost the microbes’ performance. Think of it as prebiotics for copper mines.

To scale up its technology, Transition Metal Solutions has raised a $6 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Transition Ventures with participation from Astor Management AG, Climate Capital, Dolby Family Ventures, Essential Capital, Juniper VC, Kayak Ventures, New Climate Ventures, Possible Ventures, SOSV, and Understorey Ventures.

Microbes have always been key players in the copper world, helping the metal break out of its mineral form so that we can refine it into pure metal. Companies have been working for years to coax microbes into squeezing more copper out of ore, but according to Sasha Milshteyn, co-founder and CEO of Transition, they’ve been going about it the wrong way.

Typically, companies isolate or engineer strains that show promise in boosting copper production. They grow large quantities of them and pour them over an ore heap, where the microbes soak in and get to work.

“That by and large hasn’t paid off,” Milshteyn told TechCrunch. “Often they will see kind of a boost early on and then it just kind of falls off — or they don’t see any boost at all.”

Milshteyn suspects that part of the problem is that microbes aren’t solo actors. It’s like casting a star without a supporting cast. Microbes live in diverse communities where each plays a role. Bumping up the population of one strain can only do so much.

Another part of the problem is that we’ve only scratched the surface on understanding microbes in ore heaps. “When you look into the microbial community that’s present in the material, typically well over 90% of it are things that we’ve never seen before,” Milshteyn said

Conditions inside a heap leach, as the acid-laced piles of ore are called, are challenging to replicate in a lab. The pH is low, around two, and there are clays and other metals floating around, all of which undermine the usual molecular tools scientists use to understand microbial communities.

“Everything that the industry has done has really focused on that tiny fraction that people have been able to grow in the lab,” he said. “Typically, it’s in the 5% range that you can culture.”

So instead of trying to isolate a few star performers, Transition is working to raise the entire community up. The company applies low cost, mostly inorganic compounds that are already found at mining sites.

“What we’re focused on is not necessarily boosting one or two species, but we’re we are trying to nudge the community towards the higher functional state,” he said. “We’ve observed that in the lab.”

In lab samples that Transition has applied its proprietary cocktail to, the startup has been able to extract 90% of the copper from the ore, up from 60% using traditional methods.

Outside of the lab, Milshteyn expects the efficacy to drop a bit, though not by much. Traditional heap leaches extract around 30% to 60% of the copper in the ore. He thinks Transition can bring that up to at least 50% to 70%, maybe as higher.

Each mine has a different microbial community, so Transition plans to tailor its additives based on initial testing. As the company gathers more data, Milshteyn thinks that eventually he and his team will be able to predict what a mine needs in advance.

At that rate, the company’s prebiotics could solve the copper shortage before it starts. But first, Transition has to show the mining industry that its solution works. The company plans to work with a third-party metallurgy lab that’s known within the mining world. “Without third party results, nobody’s going to believe you,” Milshteyn said. Money from the seed round should cover that phase of testing.

After Transition has proven it works in the lab, then it’ll apply its treatment to a demonstration heap containing tens of thousands of tons of material. With luck, it’ll then deploy its technology at copper mines around the world.

“We’re leaving 65% of material behind” at typical mines, Milshteyn said. “We may as well get as much out of it as we can.”

Update 8 am PT: The article previously referred to Transition’s additives as probiotics instead of prebiotics.

            <h2>US senators demand answers from X, Meta, Alphabet and others on sexualized deepfakes</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/us-senators-demand-answers-from-x-meta-alphabet-on-sexualized-deepfakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The tech world’s non-consensual, sexualized deepfake problem is now bigger than just X.

In a letter to the leaders of X, Meta, Alphabet, Snap, Reddit and TikTok, several U.S. senators are asking the companies to provide proof that they have “robust protections and policies” in place, and to explain how they plan to curb the rise of sexualized deepfakes on their platforms.

The senators also demanded that the companies preserve all documents and information relating to the creation, detection, moderation, and monetization of sexualized, AI-generated images, as well as any related policies.

The letter comes hours after X said it updated Grok to prohibit it from making edits of real people in revealing clothing, and restricted image creation and edits via Grok to paying subscribers. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)

Pointing to media reports about how easily and often Grok generated sexualized and nude images of women and children, the senators pointed out that platforms’ guardrails to prevent users from posting non-consensual, sexualized imagery may not be enough.

“We recognize that many companies maintain policies against non-consensual intimate imagery and sexual exploitation, and that many AI systems claim to block explicit pornography. In practice, however, as seen in the examples above, users are finding ways around these guardrails. Or these guardrails are failing,” the letter reads.

Grok, and consequently X, have been heavily criticized for enabling this trend, but other platforms are not immune.

Deepfakes first gained popularity on Reddit, when a page displaying synthetic porn videos of celebrities went viral before the platform took it down in 2018. Sexualized deepfakes targeting celebrities and politicians have multiplied on TikTok and YouTube, though they usually originate elsewhere.

Meta’s Oversight Board last year called out two cases of explicit AI images of female public figures, and the platform has also allowed nudify apps to sell ads on its services, though it did sue a company called CrushAI later. There have been multiple reports of kids spreading deepfakes of peers on Snapchat. And Telegram, which isn’t included on the senators’ list, has also become notorious for hosting bots built to undress photos of women.

In response to the letter, X pointed to its announcement regarding its update to Grok.

“We do not and will not allow any non-consensual intimate media (NCIM) on Reddit, do not offer any tools capable of making it, and take proactive measures to find and remove it,” a Reddit spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Reddit strictly prohibits NCIM, including depictions that have been faked or AI-generated. We also prohibit soliciting this content from others, sharing links to “nudify” apps, or discussing how to create this content on other platforms,” the spokesperson added.

Alphabet, Snap, TikTok and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The letter demands the companies provide:

The letter is signed by Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

The move comes just a day after xAI’s owner Elon Musk said that he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Later on Wednesday, California’s attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot, following mounting pressure from governments across the world incensed by the lack of guardrails around Grok that allowed this to happen.

xAI has maintained that it takes action to remove “illegal content on X, including [CSAM] and non-consensual nudity,” though neither the company nor Musk have addressed the fact that Grok was allowed to generate such edits in the first place.

The problem isn’t constrained to non-consensual manipulated sexualized imagery either. While not all AI-based image generation and editing services let users “undress” people, they do let one easily generate deepfakes. To pick a few examples, OpenAI’s Sora 2 reportedly allowed users to generate explicit videos featuring children; Google’s Nano Banana seemingly generated an image showing Charlie Kirk being shot; and racist videos made with Google’s AI video model are garnering millions of views on social media.

The issue grows even more complex when Chinese image and video generators come into the picture. Many Chinese tech companies and apps — especially those linked to ByteDance — offer easy ways to edit faces, voices and videos, and those outputs have spread to Western social platforms. China has stronger synthetic content labeling requirements that don’t exist in the U.S. on the federal level, where the masses instead rely on fragmented and dubiously enforced policies from the platforms themselves.

U.S. lawmakers have already passed some legislation seeking to rein in deepfake pornography, but the impact has been limited. The Take It Down Act, which became federal law in May, is meant to criminalize the creation and dissemination of non-consensual, sexualized imagery. But a number of provisions in the law make it difficult to hold image-generating platforms accountable, as they focus most of the scrutiny on individual users instead.

Meanwhile, a number states are trying to take matters into their own hands to protect consumers and elections. This week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul proposed laws that would require AI-generated content to be labeled as such, and ban non-consensual deepfakes in specified periods leading up to elections, including depictions of opposition candidates.

            <div id="article-text">Spotify raised prices for its subscription plan in the U.S. for the third time in three years, as it hiked the monthly plan from $11.99 per month to $12.99 per month.

The company sent an email to its paid users notifying them of the new price, which is applicable from the next monthly billing cycle.

“Occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers, enabling us to continue offering the best possible experience and benefit artists,” the company said in a blog post.

In November 2025, Financial Times reported that the audio platform is set to raise prices in the U.S in the first quarter of 2026. According to the report, analysts from JPMorgan predicted that this hike could increase Spotify’s revenue by $500 million.

The company has made similar hikes in markets like the UK and Switzerland last year.

Spotify first hiked prices in the U.S. in 2023, going from $9.99 per month to $10.99 per month. In June 2024, it made another bump of $1 per month in the individual subscription plan.

The company has more than 281 million paid users all over the globe, and 25% of them are from North America, acorrding the its Q3 2025 results.

Besides the U.S., Spotify is raising prices in Estonia and Latvia.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/parloa-triples-its-valuation-in-8-months-to-3b-with-350m-raise/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin-based Parloa has raised $350 million in Series D funding from existing investors, valuing the six-year-old customer service AI startup at $3 billion. The round comes just eight months after the company raised $120 million at a $1 billion valuation.

The new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from returning backers including EQT Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Durable Capital, and Mosaic Ventures.

Parloa is one of many startups developing AI agents that promise to automate the kind of customer service work previously handled by human representatives and help desk staff.

The company’s competitors include Sierra, co-founded by OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, which raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation in September; and Decagon, reportedly in talks to raise capital at a valuation of upwards of $4 billion. Other companies working to replace human agents with AI include older players Intercom and Kore.ai, as well as the U.K.-based PolyAI, which raised an $86 million round at a $750 million valuation last month.

Malte Kosub, Parloa’s co-founder and CEO, doesn’t seem fazed by the competition, largely because he doesn’t believe this is a “winner-take-all” category. “In the end, it is one of the biggest opportunities that has ever existed in software,” he told TechCrunch.

Indeed, Parloa and its rivals are vying to automate a significant portion of the global customer support workforce, which Gartner estimates at 17 million contact center agents worldwide.

But it’s not just the size of the market that gives Kosub confidence about Parloa’s ability to win. He pointed to the startup’s massive fundraise as a sign that it could be among the top leaders in the space. “There are a lot of companies out there, but you need to look at the scale and the amount of funding they got,” he said. “The number of competitors is decreasing significantly.”

Last month, Parloa said that it was generating annual recurring revenue of more than $50 million, but that’s not meaningfully ahead of Poly AI, which expected to end 2025 with ARR of $40 million, or Decagon, which is reportedly making “significantly more” than $30 million in ARR. Still, Kosub seems convinced that being so well capitalized will help his startup get ahead.

Parloa’s AI agents are already answering calls for large enterprise customers, which include Allianz, Booking.com, HealthEquity, SAP, Sedgwick, and Swiss Life, but the CEO says the goal is to do more than just build software that “picks up the phone.”

The company will invest a significant portion of its new capital into building a “multi-model, contextual experience” that will allow personalized AI agents to recognize a customer’s identity and specific needs, whether they reach out via an app, a website, or a phone call.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/tiger-global-loses-india-tax-case-tied-to-walmart-flipkart-deal-in-blow-to-offshore-playbook/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India’s top court has ruled against Tiger Global in a tax case stemming from its Flipkart exit during Walmart’s 2018 takeover, a decision that strengthens New Delhi’s ability to challenge offshore treaty structures and could raise tax risk for global funds counting on predictable exits from one of the world’s fastest-growing major markets.

On Thursday, the Indian Supreme Court backed the tax authorities in a dispute over whether Tiger Global could use its Mauritius-based entities to claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty and avoid paying capital gains tax in India on profits linked to its exit in the Walmart–Flipkart deal. The decision set aside a 2024 Delhi High Court ruling that had overturned a 2020 order by the Authority for Advance Rulings, which had found the firm was, prima facie, avoiding tax and therefore not eligible for treaty relief.

The ruling is being closely watched by investors, as it strengthens India’s hand in challenging offshore “treaty-routing” structures that have long been used to reduce tax on high-value exits. It could also raise uncertainty over how future cross-border deals are structured and priced, at a time when foreign funds are counting on India as a key growth market.

In its verdict, a two-judge bench said (PDF) that when a transaction appears, at first glance, to be designed to avoid income tax, India’s advance-ruling mechanism cannot be used to seek protection.

Tiger Global first invested in India’s e-commerce firm Flipkart in 2009 with an initial $9 million investment, before increasing its exposure to about $1.2 billion over multiple funding rounds, TechCrunch had reported earlier. The firm later sold its stake to Walmart for about $1.4 billion in 2018.

The tax dispute centers on how Tiger Global structured that investment — through entities in Mauritius — and whether those vehicles could claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty to shield capital gains from Indian tax.

While selling Flipkart’s stake during Walmart’s $16 billion deal, Tiger Global sought a certificate allowing no tax to be withheld, arguing that because the shares were acquired before April 1, 2017, the gains were exempt from Indian capital gains tax under a “grandfathering” clause, protecting older investments from the newer tax regime, in the India–Mauritius double taxation avoidance agreement. Indian tax authorities rejected the request in 2020, questioning the offshore structure chosen by the investment firm.

The Supreme Court bench framed the dispute as an issue of sovereign taxing powers, warning against structures that are designed primarily to dilute that authority.

“Taxing an income arising out of its own country is an inherent sovereign right of that country,” the bench said, adding that “any dilution of this power through artificial arrangements is a direct threat to its sovereignty and long-term national interest.”

The judgment should be read as a caution against aggressive tax planning rather than a wholesale dismantling of the India–Mauritius treaty framework, Ajay Rotti, a tax expert and founder and CEO of tax advisory firm Tax Compass, wrote on X. He said the decision reinforces a broader shift toward “substance over form”, signalling treaty protection may not apply automatically where offshore entities lack real commercial activity.

Tiger Global did not respond to a request for comment.

The firm can seek a review of the verdict, though such petitions are rarely successful.

            <h2>Marco Rubio’s Empty Victory in Venezuela</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/marco-rubio-venezuela-maduro/685627/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early 2019, Marco Rubio pressed his way through a dense crowd near Colombia’s border with Venezuela, his aides holding back refugees clamoring for a handshake or a photo with the man heralding the imminent arrival, they all felt sure, of liberty for Venezuelans. With his polo shirt dotted with sweat and a Venezuela Libre cap shielding his face from the tropical sun, the then-senator made an urgent appeal to the country’s security forces: Do the right thing and defy Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian orders. “In every person’s life there sometimes comes a key moment,” Rubio said, “when they have to make a decision, a decision that will define the rest of their life.”

This may be that defining moment for Rubio, Donald Trump’s secretary of state, national security adviser, and, now, unofficial Venezuelan viceroy. Maduro’s ouster begins to fulfill an objective central to Rubio’s political identity: ending the reign of Latin America’s leftist strongmen. But it leaves a tandem goal—replacing them with democratically elected governments—nowhere closer to reality. That latter objective is instead colliding with Trump’s focus in Venezuela on oil, migration, and regional dominance. Determined to prove that military intervention will pay for itself, he’s shown no interest in giving the Venezuelan people a say in their own affairs. The disconnect poses a dilemma for Rubio, who had long advocated for widening the circle of those reaping the blessings of liberty.

Speaking to the crowd in the Colombian border city of Cúcuta seven years ago, as Washington and other governments backed what they saw as an unstoppable popular uprising against Maduro, Rubio said the United States would stand by Venezuelans until they achieved the rights they deserved. “Freedom and democracy require sacrifice,” he said in Spanish. In this case, the things that appear to have been sacrificed, for the foreseeable future, are the freedom and democracy of Venezuelans.

Across Latin America, the coups, juntas, and disappearances that dominated the 20th century are now mostly relegated to the past. The region’s gradual democratization, now complete except for authoritarian holdouts in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, found strong support from U.S. politicians of both parties. America would respect the wishes of Latin America’s voters, leaders in Washington said over the years, and gunboat diplomacy would be retired. But Trump has ushered in a new era. Along the way, he has sidelined Venezuela’s pro-democracy opposition leaders, María Corina Machado and Edmundo González, even though Washington and others recognized that González beat Maduro in the 2024 presidential election. “It’s a total change for people like Marco Rubio, who supported democratic change in the region,” Todd Robinson, who led the U.S. mission to Venezuela during Trump’s first term, told us. “I’m completely flabbergasted.”

Rubio has laid out a three-stage plan for Venezuela. It begins with stabilization, funded by the proposed seizure and sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil. Then follows foreign investment in the country’s mineral and energy sectors and steps to begin reconciliation with Maduro’s opposition. Finally comes an undefined political transition. Although Trump is moving ahead with negotiations over oil, his efforts to push U.S. companies to open their wallets have so far yielded few results. And like Trump’s plans for a petro-renaissance, Rubio’s hopes for a flourishing future could yet devolve into chaos.

Rubio’s supporters say the approach reflects sober, mature statecraft designed to avoid the mistakes the U.S. made in nation building in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya after 9/11. Instead of ousting the governing class in a push for societal freedoms, Trump and Rubio have blessed Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, as interim president and chief interlocutor. Other key figures responsible for the regime’s years of repressive practices—the arrest and torture of opponents, the abuse and killing of protesters—remain in place. (That includes Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who allegedly ordered Rubio’s assassination in 2017. U.S. officials couldn’t verify the threat, but it led to Rubio getting a security detail.) In effect, Rubio sees the current plan as a series of necessary steps on the road toward self-governance and other Jeffersonian ideals, his supporters say.

“This is learning the lesson from history and understanding that without stability, you&#39;re not going to get this other piece of it,” one person familiar with the planning process told us. “If you can be in a position where you have leadership—they are not legitimate leadership, but they’re the de facto ones running the country—and they are willing to do things that Maduro did not do and begin to make the transition, that is a better outcome than what we had under Maduro. And it’s certainly a better outcome than the way that it was approached in Iraq.”

The day after Maduro’s ouster, Rubio portrayed the operation as a blend of his high-minded goals for Latin America and the administration’s unapologetic self-interest in “America First.”

“We care about elections, we care about democracy, we care about all of that, but the No. 1 thing we care about is the safety, security, well-being, and prosperity of the United States,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press. “And that’s what we’re going to focus on first and foremost here.”

Rubio’s politics were forged in South Florida, where he grew up surrounded by Latin Americans who had escaped political repression or turmoil. His own family’s flight from Cuba in the 1950s played a central role in shaping his worldview. That dislocation at once spared them the abuse and privations of Communist Cuba and inculcated Rubio with a harsh view of Latin America’s leftist failures. Rubio has credited his maternal grandfather for ushering him into the Republican Party at a young age and, after Jimmy Carter’s 1979 hostage fiasco, imparting the importance of American leaders projecting strength to the world.

After vaulting into the U.S. Senate from Florida state politics, in 2011, Rubio emerged as perhaps the leading advocate for political change in Latin America—the ideal scenario for which would be dislodging the Communist bosses of his family’s home island. Rubio argued frequently for protecting the hemisphere from the influence of China, Russia, and Iran, but he always put that goal in the context of a principled struggle for political liberty and civil rights. “This is not about just Nicolás Maduro, because if you want another dictator, there are, like, seven or eight other people who are more than happy to be the next dictator,” Rubio said in 2019 with unwitting prescience. “This is about transitioning to democracy, about restoring, helping the people of Venezuela restore constitutional order.”

During Trump’s first term, the president and Rubio dispensed with the mutual hectoring of the 2016 campaign and together supported Venezuelan national assembly leader Juan Guaidó’s attempt to force Maduro from power in 2019. When Trump mused about using force against Maduro, those around him let the idea die, including Rubio himself, according to then–National Security Adviser John Bolton. Guaidó’s uprising failed, but Rubio remained a key adviser on Latin America.

The president grew fond of his onetime political foe, who shared his love of sports, and believed Rubio to be a useful advocate in the Senate. Rubio also developed relationships with others in Trump’s inner circle, working with Ivanka Trump on expanding the child tax credit.

Rubio “tells it like it is, but he doesn’t tell the president how to think or what to do,” a senior administration official told us. “He also knows how to get the president’s attention, and I think we saw that play out with the Venezuela policy.”

When James Story served as U.S. ambassador to Venezuela from 2018 to 2023, he met with Rubio more than he did with any other senator. Their conversations, Story told us, focused on Maduro’s brutality and illegitimacy; he said the two men never discussed oil.

As Trump angled to return to the White House in 2025, Trump considered Rubio as a potential running mate who brought anti-communist bona fides. Trump selected J. D. Vance instead, but Rubio became secretary of state and then, in short order, national security adviser and the archivist of the United States. He is among the tiny cohort helping Trump make major foreign-policy decisions, often in a way that avoids the government’s in-house experts. Although Rubio has been coy about whether he will launch a future presidential bid, those who know him say he retains those ambitions.

Rubio has evolved into a more sharp-edged nationalist in other ways, backing Trump’s bid to take Greenland and forcing out visa holders who criticize U.S. policies. Rubio was also a longtime supporter of foreign-assistance and media programs that the administration has scrapped under his watch. Ironically, the official purpose of Rubio’s 2019 visit to the Colombia-Venezuela border was to highlight Washington’s supply of humanitarian aid, which U.S. officials accused Maduro of blocking out of spite. In Cúcuta, visitors took in sacks of food and other necessities provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Rubio helped dismantle over the past year.

Rubio has chided critics for failing to acknowledge—as he says U.S. leaders did for too long—that all nations act in their own interests. It’s only right for the United States to do the same, he has argued, and keep out of other countries’ affairs unless they impact our own. It’s a worldview in line with what Trump outlined in Saudi Arabia in May, when he suggested that Middle Eastern nations were right to ignore the “Western interventionalists” who told them how to run their countries. (In Venezuela, however, Trump and Rubio are doing exactly that.)

In the months leading up to the Maduro action, Rubio worked closely with the immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller as the Pentagon built up a highly unusual naval and air force in the Caribbean and then began deadly strikes on suspected drug-trafficking boats. Since Maduro’s capture, Rubio has gone along with Trump’s sidelining of Machado, whom the president says doesn’t command the respect of Venezuelans.

Cesar Conda, who served as Rubio’s chief of staff in the Senate, told us that Rubio’s long-term objective remains a democratic Venezuela, even if other members of the administration don’t share that goal. But, Conda added, “given the political realities, I suspect Marco was willing to set aside the Venezuelan opposition for now. As with most issues, he’s adept at working within the policy constraints of this White House.”

Representative Darren Soto, a Democrat from central Florida who knows Rubio well, said his constituents have welcomed Maduro’s departure from Venezuela. But, Soto told us, “even with a new head of the snake, it’s undecided whether we’ll see any more stability. The ultimate goal must be new free and fair elections in order to truly achieve that objective.”

In the meantime, Soto and other Democrats are accusing Trump and his advisers of harming the Venezuelans they say they’re acting to help. They are demanding the administration reinstate Temporary Protected Status—which allows foreigners to remain in the United States because of perilous conditions in their home countries—for Venezuelans. They argue that some Venezuelans who return home could be detained or murdered given that the regime remains intact. The administration ended Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans last year, saying the country’s conditions no longer justified special protections. The government in Caracas has detained people caught celebrating Maduro’s ouster and, according to activists, released only a few dozen of the hundreds of political opponents held in regime custody.

For the moment, those concerns take a back seat to stability. “We don’t want backwards movement on those. We don’t necessarily need progress,” the person familiar with Rubio’s plans said. “Progress would be nice, obviously, but stability is the most important key here.” Asked whether the ultimate goal remains democracy and political freedoms, the person cited the need for cooperation on security, migration, cyber, and other issues, and on choosing Washington over Beijing and Moscow. “The big-picture goal in the hemisphere is to have countries that are aligned with the United States,” the person said.

To that end, Trump has issued threats in recent days against other countries and territories in his sights, starting with Greenland and Cuba. One unanswered question is whether Rubio, if he and Trump follow through with those warnings, would be willing to support a similar outcome in Havana, keeping most of Cuba’s Communist leaders in place. “If Cuba had something we wanted, would we say, ‘Okay, we’re going to take that, and then we’re going to wait on the democracy piece?’” Story, the former ambassador, said.

The last time that democracy was dangling just out of reach for Venezuelans, when Rubio gave his impromptu press conference in Cúcuta, a boy of 7 or 8 yelled the senator’s name from afar and was pushed to the front of the crowd. The boy, named Juan Ángel, was holding a half-eaten apple as he was lifted to the podium. “The children of Venezuela want freedom,” he said in his tinny little voice.

“And that’s what we want for you,” Rubio responded, reaching across a bank of microphones to shake his hand. “You’re going to be with your family in a free and democratic Venezuela, God willing.”

As often happens, Stephen Miller gave the locker-room talk, which was, more or less: No one can stop us. Back in October, when Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker objected to having more federal immigration officers in his state, the deputy chief of staff and dominant West Wing voice had a message in response.

“ To all ICE officers, you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties, and anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony,” he said on Fox News.

After the ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed the protester Renee Good, the administration stuck to that message. It declined to open an investigation into the shooting, and said it would be sending hundreds more ICE officers into the state; then it pushed to instead initiate an investigation into Renee Good’s widow. The we-have-your-back attitude, says our staff writer Nick Miroff, who covers immigration, undoubtedly emboldens ICE. It sends “a signal to continue to do what they’re doing, to not give any ground to protesters or to public officials in Minnesota,” Nick says.

But is Miller correct? Are ICE agents in fact immune? Can anyone hold them accountable? The federal government may have the officers’ backs, but state laws have jurisdiction too, and Minnesota is so far not ceding to the administration’s wishes.

This week, six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned reportedly because of the Justice Department’s push to investigate Good’s widow, but not Ross. States and the federal government have historically fought over holding each other’s agents accountable, and states have not always lost.

In this week’s episode, we talk to Bryna Godar, an attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. She studies the power that states have to hold federal officers such as Ross accountable. And we ask Miroff whether ICE is expanding beyond immigration enforcement, turning Homeland Security into an openly political entity that welcomes clashes with American citizens.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Minneapolis remains tense this week. People are out on the streets clashing with ICE agents. Social media is full of a new kind of video: federal agents not out arresting undocumented immigrants, but getting into physical confrontations with American citizens, sometimes on otherwise quiet suburban streets.

Rosin: One video circulating this week showed a masked ICE agent shoving a Minneapolis city councilman into the street.

Protester 1: Yo! Yo! What the fuck are you doing?

Protester 2: Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!

Rosin: The protests come, of course, after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed an unarmed protester, Renee Good, in her car. And they’ve grown dramatically with the Trump administration’s response to the shooting, which has been no Department of Justice investigation, no sense of accountability or even discussion of accountability.

In fact, the administration has reflexively defended the shooter and dismissed Good as “highly disrespectful” and committing an “act of domestic terrorism.” And then the administration is sending hundreds more officers into the city to double down on their mission, which leaves citizens everywhere asking, Have we reached the point where a federal agent can shoot an unarmed American citizen and we just continue on with the program?

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Today: Will there be justice, or will things only get worse?

Back in October, as Illinois leaders pushed back on the immigration deployment in their state, [President Donald] Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, had this message on Fox News.

Stephen Miller (on Fox News):  To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties, and anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one—no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator, or domestic insurrectionist—can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.

Rosin: Miller’s message—that you can operate with impunity, even against Americans—suggests that maybe the role of ICE is evolving. Could Homeland Security be turning into an openly political entity that welcomes clashes with American citizens? We’ll talk about that in the second half of the show.

But first, there is another important authority in the mix: the state of Minnesota, which seems not to be falling in line with the administration’s program.

This week, six federal prosecutors in Minnesota reportedly resigned because the Justice Department pushed to investigate Good’s widow, but not the ICE agent who shot Good.

Bryna Godar: I think this does mark a significant shift for the country and is potentially setting up an escalating conflict between states and the federal government in a way that we haven’t seen in a long time.

Rosin: That is Bryna Godar, an attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Godar studies the power that states have to hold federal officers, like ICE agent Ross, accountable.

I started by asking her about Stepehen Miller’s claim: that they were immune.

Rosin (in interview): Is that a real thing? Do federal officers have this kind of immunity that he’s describing?

Godar: They do not have immunity that is that broad. Federal officers do have some immunity, but it is not absolute immunity for things that they do on the job. They still have to comply with federal laws. They still have to act in a reasonable way in carrying out their duties and not violate people’s rights.

Rosin: If Minnesota decides they wanna charge this specific shooter with a crime, and the federal government has already decided he didn’t do anything wrong, what happens? How does that unfold?

Godar: So the state—or in this case, it would likely be Hennepin County prosecutors—could file criminal charges against the officer involved if they think they have enough evidence there. And then that officer would likely claim federal immunity and try to get the case moved to federal court and try to get the charges thrown out based on claims of federal immunity.

And from there, it would just depend on what the federal court decided, of whether the case could proceed. And if it did, then state and local prosecutors would go ahead and take that case to trial in federal court for a state-law crime.

Rosin: So this is a gray area. It’s like, there’s a lot of details to be hashed out—

Rosin: —in a situation like this. Right. And is it the kind of thing that would get adjudicated for years, or is it fairly clear—they put out a warrant for the shooter’s arrest? How does it unfold, in general?

Godar: We have seen some cases take years to resolve on this immunity issue. For example, the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident, where a federal sniper shot and killed an unarmed woman. That took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the Ninth Circuit ultimately ruled that that case could go ahead and that that officer didn’t necessarily have immunity from the state criminal prosecution in that.

So these are not easy cases, and I don’t wanna overstate the ability of states to win these cases. We have seen repeatedly that federal courts will throw out charges if the federal courts think that the officer is acting reasonably and carrying out their federal duties in a reasonable way.

But states have succeeded in getting these cases to trial in cases where the facts were sufficiently disputed, and the federal court agreed that it wasn’t clear that the officer was acting with lawful force. So that’s really the big hurdle here, is if the state can show that there is enough question around the reasonableness of this officer’s actions in order to get over that immunity hurdle.

Rosin: Right, and as you’ve watched the administration respond to this particular case, have you seen them kind of preempt some of these arguments? ’Cause they’re speaking in very specific language about force, the correct use of force, all this kind of stuff.

Godar: This administration is, first of all, trying to say that states don’t even have the power to bring these types of cases, which is just flatly wrong based on this long history of states bringing this exact type of case. And the federal government is definitely trying to spin the narrative in a certain way so that the officer would be able to more easily claim immunity.

But it’s important to note that this would ultimately be a decision in federal court, and it wouldn’t be the federal-administration officials who have been speaking about this being the ones who are making that determination.

Rosin: Right. So they can spin a public narrative, but it doesn’t necessarily affect or determine what happens in the actual courts.

Rosin: I guess I have a fundamental question, which is: Why is the law designed this way? Why is it important for states to be able to hold the federal government accountable in certain cases?

Godar: Yeah, so this idea of dual sovereignty and the checks and balances that come with that is baked into how our country is designed. So at the founding, there was this idea that, if the federal government overstepped on people’s rights, the states would be there to check the federal government and vice versa. And that was really seen as foundational to protecting people’s rights and guarding against tyranny and abuse from the federal government or state governments.

Throughout history, these cases have come up most frequently during periods of more friction between the states and the federal government.

Godar: Some of the times where we’ve seen this come up include the Prohibition era, where there was pretty intense and violent federal enforcement of prohibition laws, and states were charging federal officers with violating various state criminal laws, like manslaughter, murder, assault, in carrying out those actions.

Other times, we’ve seen states more actively pushing back on the enforcement of federal laws, such as when the Fugitive Slave Act was in existence. We saw a number of states, including Wisconsin, charging U.S. marshals with kidnapping for capturing previously enslaved people. And in some of those cases, the federal courts were quite quick to throw out those charges because the federal officers were acting lawfully under federal law, but the states were nevertheless using that as a tool to push back on those federal actions.

And then, conversely, we saw during periods of desegregation some states pushing back on federal government efforts to integrate schools and enforce desegregation policies.

Rosin: So I have heard the administration put out statements to state officials sort of warning them against taking state action.

Godar: Yes, there have been multiple statements from federal officials threatening to charge state and local officials who are considering charges against federal officers, to charge them with federal crimes like obstruction, harboring aliens, conspiring to impede federal officers, or seditious conspiracy. We’ve seen these from U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as well as Stephen Miller and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

These statements really upend the traditional dynamic in these cases, where it’s typically up to the federal courts to decide whether a state is overstepping in its prosecution, and that’s the check and balance that we have in this system.

I think the goal of these threats is to stop state and local officials from pursuing these types of cases, and I think it’s possible that federal officials could follow up on those threats. I think it’s highly unlikely that they would ultimately succeed in court if state and local officials are really just carrying out their jobs, but that doesn’t mean that federal officials couldn’t try to bring those cases.

Rosin: It’s interesting because, with law-enforcement actions, at least most recently, it’s been the opposite: It’s been federal government putting pressure on states to hold local police departments accountable, like in George Floyd’s death, for example. And now we have this inversion: The state’s trying to put a check on federal officers. How does that inversion change the power dynamic here?

Godar: I think one difficult aspect of it is that it’s not something that we are super familiar with in recent decades. And so I think it’s just unfamiliar to people that states actually have this power and have this role and that that is a proper role for states to play.

And then I think the other way it impacts it is that there are dynamics about the investigation process that are flipped, where instead of concerns about a state withholding information from federal investigators, that is now flipped as well, where there’s concerns about federal investigators withholding information from state investigators.

Rosin: Looking back at the history, is there a case, a moment, an instance, which gives you hope about this situation, where something or someone or some state has risen to the occasion in a way that we can look to now and think, Oh, that’s the model?

Godar: There are several cases where federal courts have recognized that federal officers do not have absolute immunity and that, even where the facts are sufficiently disputed, the case can go ahead, so I would specifically point to the U.S. Supreme Court deciding in a 1906 case where two federal soldiers shot and killed a man who they believed was stealing from federal property.

And we’ve seen this in other cases too, where if the facts are sufficiently in dispute and there’s a version of them that seems to suggest that the officer was just not acting reasonably, those cases can go ahead. Even if the officer ultimately wins at trial, that immunity step, I think, is really important for getting the case over that hurdle and to a trial, and recognizing that it doesn’t have to be that the facts are all predetermined. It can be enough that there is this debate over what the officer did was reasonable.

Rosin: I think what’s challenging about this particular moment is that the federal government didn’t just forego investigating whether the shooting was justified; now they seem to be opening an investigation into Becca Good, the widow of Renee Good. So what do you make of all that—the federal government’s just absolute, definitive stance?

Godar: It is really unprecedented to see that type of extreme defense of an officer before watching the whole process play out and gathering all the facts.

Godar: And I think it is a point that really underscores how important it is to have states protecting their residents as well, because if you have one level of government failing at that and violating people’s rights, you really would not have an option if you didn’t have the state there. And so I think this really highlights the importance of that role, and I think seeing if that actually is going to be an effective method of accountability is really important for the future of the country.

Rosin: Well, Bryna, thank you so much for explaining this all to us and its implications.

Rosin: So in short, no, federal agents, such as ICE officers, do not have absolute immunity—despite what the Trump administration says. States can prosecute federal officers, although we’re not used to seeing that lately, and it sounds like it’s a long road.

So does the average ICE officer on the streets of Minneapolis think they’re immune? And how does that affect their behavior?

After the break, we go inside the Department of Homeland Security. We talk to Nick Miroff, Atlantic staff writer who covers immigration. That’s in a minute.

Rosin: So it’s already been an eventful year for ICE and DHS, and then came last week.

Hours after Renee Good was killed, we all saw those videos circulating about the shooting, and instead of the usual pledges to investigate that we would expect, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the shooting, called Good’s actions an “act of domestic terrorism.”

For someone who’s followed these agencies for years, what did you make of the administration’s response to what happened?

Miroff: I think it’s a sign of the knee-jerk defensive posture that they are in. It goes hand in hand with the aggressive deployment of these officers and agents in these cities, with marching orders to—let’s think about the “F around and find out” ethos of our foreign-policy adventures in the current moment.

Miroff: I think it’s also being applied in a domestic context, and there is a diminishing patience with public pushback, with protest tactics—

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem: —and when a mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began—

Miroff: —with the idea that officers and agents are gonna be restrained and are gonna try to avoid engaging directly with the protests.

Noem: —this appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents.

Miroff: And so when she immediately leapt to defend Officer Ross’s decisions—

Miroff: —I saw that as an eagerness to both send a kind of political signal to the president’s base, but also a signal to the broader DHS workforce, which includes ICE, that this White House and this administration is basically gonna defend you no matter what you do.

Rosin: So that’s the administration’s position. What are you hearing from people at ICE and DHS? Are they leaning into this fight? Are they with the administration, either at the leadership level or rank and file? Can you tell?

Miroff: Well, these videos were like a Rorschach test for the country and our politics, and it’s not surprising that that’s also true within the ICE workforce, though it’s not like I’ve done a broad poll, but I have tried to ask almost everybody I can think of what they saw.

And it ranges from—I’ve had very senior ICE officials, who are not softies by any means, tell me that this was just straight-up murder, and that Officer Ross was way out of line and needs to be held accountable in a way that sends a real signal to the rest of the workforce.

But I think that—I would say that, to generalize, most of the ICE officials that I heard from had a kind of a more nuanced view and felt like, once that vehicle was coming at Officer Ross, that he could be found to have made a reasonable decision to fire in self-defense, and that most of the people I spoke to said that he made a very risky decision and putting himself in front of that vehicle with its engine on was inherently dangerous.

And some of the folks I spoke to have heard that he, within the Minneapolis field office, had had a reputation for being really, like, gung ho—one person put it euphemistically: that he was very “enthusiastic” about his job. But he was a guy who was clearly highly trained and was really doing his job aggressively. The incident in June, in which he was very seriously injured, similarly involved taking some risks, some tactics that are generally discouraged. In this case, he was stopping this individual, and he shattered the window, and then he reached into the vehicle, and he ends up getting dragged and all cut up on his arm.

It’s not hard to think that that incident must have played into his mindset when he was approaching Good, but it’s like, if you’ve had that happen to you recently, to go and stand in front of a vehicle like that again is a very dangerous posture to take.

Rosin: Before you knew anything about the shooter, before we even knew his name, would you have guessed it was one of the new recruits? ’Cause you’ve written a lot about how ICE has tried to staff up quickly. Were you surprised to learn that this was actually a veteran officer?

Miroff: I was surprised. My first thought was, like, Oh, wow. Is this one of the new hires that they just rushed through the academy? And so to see that Officer Ross is not only, like, a 10-year veteran of ICE, he’s a member of the Special Response Team, which is their tactical unit that’s the most highly trained, so they are trained to be in more confrontational and riskier situations—he’s not, like, some case officer who’s been pushed out onto the street with a gun and is out of their element. He is used to being in tense, confrontational situations like this. He would’ve practiced these kinds of scenarios many times.

And before that, he was a Border Patrol agent. He was an Iraq War veteran. This is a guy who’s been in military or law-enforcement services his entire career and has had to go through any number of training exercises in which use-of-force policies would be addressed.

Rosin: So how do you make sense of that? The Minneapolis chief of police, recently, when he was criticizing ICE’s actions, referred to that June injury to Officer Ross and whether the agency was making sure he wouldn’t behave unsafely in similar situations. So that’s maybe one theory out there about what happened. Do you have another theory? You just described him as kind of prepared.

Miroff: The interpretation that makes sense to me, that I’ve discussed with some sources—who are just, again, don’t have actual information about the investigation, but are observing, trying to formulate a version of what could have happened based on the videos—is that they were preparing to maybe arrest Renee Good and her partner for obstruction.

Miroff: And so you see that he pulls out his phone, and he’s going around the vehicle recording her license plate.

Becca Good (in video of her encounter with Jonathan Ross): It’s okay. We don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know.

Miroff: And then, at the moment when he seems to sort of complete the circumnavigation of the vehicle, that’s when she’s simultaneously hearing from her partner to drive—

Miroff: —grabbing the passenger-side handle, while you have another ICE officer approaching, telling her to get the F out of the car.

ICE officer: Out of the car. Get out of the fucking car.

Miroff: And then she starts turning the wheel and hits the gas, and it’s impossible to know, was he looking at his phone? What was he looking at, right? And all of that is gonna come out in the investigation.

But I think these things are entirely split-second decisions, and he, based on what we’ve seen from the video, seemed like he was pretty antagonized and was in a pretty aggressive mindset, based on just his conduct in the 40-odd seconds.

So it’s really gonna come down to: Was it a reasonable decision to start to open fire once that vehicle was rolling? And so, again, a lot of the ICE officers I’ve talked to about this think it probably was. And we could end up where—

Miroff: You could end up with a kind of situation where he will be faulted for putting himself in a dangerous situation, but he wouldn’t be held criminally liable for killing Renee Good, because the vehicle was coming at him and he had a reasonable fear that he could be killed or injured.

Rosin: So there’s the details of this case, and then there’s the administration’s response, which is a reflexive defense of this officer. And then there’s this week, in which things seem to be amping up in Minneapolis. We’ve seen videos of ICE agents breaking a car window, shoving a city councilman. How do you think the administration response is affecting how ICE officers are behaving on the streets? Does it embolden them? Are they worried? What’s your sense of that?

Miroff: I think it emboldens them. I think when they see other administration officials with this kind of unqualified defense of whatever they’re doing, and an investigation that is trying to criminalize Renee Good and her partner, turning the focus of the attention to them, I think that that undoubtedly sends a signal to continue to do what they’re doing, to not give any ground to protesters or to public officials in Minnesota.

And what we saw in Chicago in the late summer and fall was not dissimilar.

Miroff: They shot and killed a guy who wouldn’t comply with their orders in his car.

News anchor (from NBC Chicago): It happened during a traffic stop in Franklin Park. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the man resisted arrest and dragged the officer—

Miroff: They shot a protester, Marimar Martinez, who was in her vehicle, five times—

News anchor (from ABC 7 Chicago): The Department of Homeland Security says the woman was one of several people using their vehicles to box in agents—

Miroff: —and then tried to charge her with a federal crime, ultimately dropping the charges.

But, again, we saw protesters and agents and officers in these intense confrontations in the street. We saw them pulling their guns. We saw them shooting people. But once the evidence made its way into courtrooms, and it started to go badly for the administration, the administration kind of pulled back.

And we’re at the stage right now where it’s too early to say what their response will be once evidence involving this shooting and other incidents is introduced into court. But it doesn’t seem like this administration is gonna back down from street-level protests or from public officials in Minneapolis dropping F-bombs at press conferences.

Rosin: Okay, so we spoke to an attorney, who told us that, despite the federal government saying, We have your back, it’s not actually true; states can prosecute ICE officers, or they have some tools to do that. What do you think the rank-and-file ICE officers believe? Do you think they believe they’re immune? Do they know this?

Miroff: I don’t know. I’ve heard that, but what is an example of a state successfully prosecuting a federal law-enforcement officer in recent years based on a use-of-force incident of this kind? Everybody I asked about this told me that these cases are transferred into federal court and that it’s extremely rare for state or local jurisdictions to successfully bring charges against a federal law-enforcement officer accused of wrongdoing while in the course of their duties.

Rosin: So I guess there’s two things here. It’s definitely possible, but maybe it hasn’t happened in recent history, so it’s not prime in their minds. The bigger thing, though, is the things that you’re describing—me, as an average citizen, I look at ICE; I think, Oh, ICE had a mandate to find undocumented immigrants. What you and I are talking about here is: ICE shot an American citizen, or ICE going after an American citizen. That is very, very, very different. Do you see it as different? Do you see ICE as evolving into a very different role than what it initially started as or what one would think ICE is?

Miroff: Absolutely. Just to be clear, there is no precedent for what we’re seeing right now, where the Border Patrol and ICE officers are in the streets of American cities, in neighborhoods, pulling cars over, confronting protesters, zooming around in unmarked cars with masks on. This is just not what these agencies were created to do.

And so at the root of all of this is the Trump administration’s quest for a million deportations a year, a mass-deportation campaign that is going to happen in this episodic, rolling basis in blue, Democratic-run cities, and a desire to have imagery of confrontation in which they can have this political fight over immigration, the future of this country, left-wing protesters, have all of these things play out on social media, on television. I think that they think it is winning politics for them, and I think that they think that this is winning policy for them. This is what Stephen Miller has been building up to his entire political career.

We didn’t see it on this kind of level in the first Trump administration, because there were checks, there were safeguards, the border was still the focus. But now that the border is basically closed, and all of the energy and the resources and attention are on this deportation campaign, these confrontations are what they’ve been building up to for a long time.

Rosin: So where this goes—Trump is not gonna be president forever. It does feel right now like the Department of Homeland Security has become much more openly political than we’re used to a federal department being. So do the DHS people worry about what happens when Trump is not in office?

Miroff: So this is something that I’m writing about this week. And I think that the main takeaway is that the Department of Homeland Security has gotten way off of its foundational mission.

Miroff: But at the core of it is this unresolved conflict in our politics and our country about immigration enforcement, and the role of immigration and immigrants in American society. And there are two completely divergent visions right now that are clashing in a way we’ve never seen.

Rosin: Thank you, Nick. Thanks for joining us.

Miroff: My pleasure. Always good to be with you.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/danger-to-minds-young-girls-margaret-anderson-book-review/685622/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many editors languish in the margins of history, their contributions largely invisible despite how much they shape whom and how we read. But in recent years, amid a wave of books unearthing overlooked figures, biographers have turned their sights to pioneering book and magazine editors—including Malcolm Cowley of Viking, Judith Jones of Knopf, Bennett Cerf of Random House, and Katharine S. White of The New Yorker—anointing them as the unsung architects of the American literary canon. These biographies tend to illuminate not only the editors’ work, but their lives, challenging the stereotype that they were mere pencil pushers.

Perhaps it was only a matter of time before the trend came for Margaret C. Anderson, whose avant-garde, Chicago-based literary magazine, The Little Review, introduced American readers to such modernist heavyweights as Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and James Joyce. Adam Morgan’s impassioned, finely researched new book, A Danger to the Minds of Young Girls, isn’t the first account of Anderson’s life and work—that would be Making No Compromise, Holly A. Baggett’s dual biography of Anderson and her co-editor and romantic partner, Jane Heap. But this is the first to focus entirely on Anderson, who founded The Little Review in 1914. Morgan, also the founding editor of a Chicago-based literary magazine, convincingly argues that Anderson more or less single-handedly transformed the Review “from a Chicago curio” into a transatlantic journal of note by publishing a coterie of experimental European and American expat writers.

That Anderson isn’t particularly well remembered is somewhat surprising when you consider her central role in one of the first literary-obscenity trials in American history. In 1918, four years before the American bookseller Sylvia Beach published Joyce’s Ulysses in Paris, Anderson began serializing the novel in The Little Review. She was forced to stop in 1920, when censors arrested and charged her and Heap with the felony of publishing something—in particular, the book’s sexually explicit “Nausicaa” episode—so “lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent and disgusting.” The women were found guilty, and each was fined $50. The ruling effectively banned Ulysses in the United States, where it would not be published in full until 1934, by Random House.

The freewheeling Anderson was the kind of ahead-of-her-time woman whose story is likely to be catnip to many contemporary readers, myself included. Before she championed modernism in literature, she applied its tenets in life and love, rejecting tradition and embracing experimentation. At the age of 21, she left the staid Indianapolis for Chicago, a metropolis at the height of its literary renaissance, and later lived in the bohemian hotbeds of Greenwich Village and Paris. And she managed to fund and distribute her publication despite sexism, homophobia, a world war, and political censorship.

All of this helps explain why a full-scale treatment of Anderson feels overdue, but some circumstances complicate the pursuit of a comprehensive biography. Although The Little Review’s legacy was lasting, her affiliation with it—and with the world of American letters—was brief. She had been an editor for less than a decade before departing both the magazine and the U.S. In reality, she was less a lifelong champion of the written word than an aesthete who seemed to constantly seek intellectual stimulation, whether in the form of literature, music, sex, or spirited conversation. After her short but intense dalliance with publishing, she mostly wandered Europe in pursuit of pleasure, not so much channeling her passions toward a goal as accreting experiences—which is to say, living the way most people do, somewhat aimlessly.

The anticlimactic arc of Anderson’s story presents a challenge to the biographer keen on keeping readers’ attention. In the case of A Danger to the Minds of Young Girls, Morgan focuses on the most interesting and narratively coherent portion of his subject’s life—her tenure as an editor—while spending less than a third of the book on the 50 years that she lived after leaving the magazine. So Morgan’s conclusion, on the last page, that Anderson’s “greatest work” was not The Little Review but rather “the life she had forged” is a bit surprising. Contrary to his own assessment, Morgan provides a far more extensive account of his subject’s early work than her life as a whole. And at times, he appears to struggle to see Anderson for who she was, rather than who he seems to want her to be.

From 1914 to 1923, Anderson’s life was inseparable from her work. “The ultimate reason for life is Art,” she declares in a 1916 issue of The Little Review by way of a mission statement. And she walked the walk: In the magazine’s early days, when its subscriber base had faltered because of Anderson’s anarchist sympathies, Morgan writes, she was “faced with a choice between keeping her magazine alive and keeping a roof over her head”—and so for six months, she lived in a tent on the banks of Lake Michigan, editing by firelight. But in the early ’20s, her youthful enthusiasm was eroded by the backlash to Ulysses, which had cost her both advertisers and subscribers even before the taxing trial and public censure. And when critics celebrated Beach’s edition of Ulysses, a book they had greeted with silence if not ridicule when Anderson serialized it, she took it as an insult. Thoroughly disenchanted, she saw that she was perhaps not cut out for a life so devoted to one’s work, that is, a career in the arts.

By 1924, Anderson writes in her 1951 memoir, “it wasn’t the Little Review that mattered; and it wasn’t Art that mattered any longer.” She was now interested in what she calls “an art of life”—a way of living that wrung every drop from existence by accumulating experiences. This renunciation of her editorial work doesn’t appear in A Danger to the Minds of Young Girls, though Morgan leans heavily on Anderson’s writings to scaffold the book. (He acknowledges, however, that she could be an unreliable if not outright mendacious memoirist: She claimed, for instance, to have spoken with F. Scott Fitzgerald at the office of his editor, Max Perkins, in 1913, when Fitzgerald would have been a teenager—years before he and Perkins actually met.) The half century that followed is a thornier, more muddled chapter in Anderson’s story: She led a peripatetic, often cash-strapped existence in France alongside her lover, the opera singer Georgette Leblanc (as well as several other paramours), before spending her later years as a self-described “recluse” in New York. She also spent decades in thrall to the spiritual leader George Gurdjieff, an Armenian-born mystic who preached divinity through labor.

As its subject’s life loses coherence, the book moves through the years with a sense of rushed obligation. Morgan concedes that, although Anderson still rubbed elbows with the literati, her “passion for art, music, and literature was transforming into something more esoteric”—and therefore more difficult to make legible, let alone compelling. Morgan’s less energetic attempts to cover these years, contrasted with the absorbing sections that come before it, brings to mind biographies that benefited from jettisoning the impulse to be comprehensive. Take Vivian Gornick’s The Solitude of Self, about the suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, or Jazmina Barrera’s The Queen of Swords, about the Mexican writer Elena Garro—two unconventionally structured and hardly exhaustive, but nonetheless superb, accounts of a figure close to the author’s heart, just as Anderson is to Morgan’s.

Read: A book that puts the life back into biography

Morgan isn’t the first admirer of Anderson who has related strongly to one aspect of her life only to struggle to metabolize the rest of it. In Jessa Crispin’s 2015 book, The Dead Ladies Project, about exiled and expat writers and artists, the author devotes a chapter to Anderson’s second act in the south of France. Yet Crispin concedes that she really wants to write only about Anderson’s “hard climb out of her hometown,” which echoes Crispin’s own experience and is, in her estimation, simply more interesting. “In France she found her spiritual home. How boring,” she writes. “Wouldn’t we all just rather picture Hannibal moving elephants over mountains than winning battles against the Romans?”

Here Crispin cheekily poses a choice that all biographers must make: what to do with the boring bits. And behind this choice is a more profound question: Are biographers storytellers or annalists? The best of them combine the two vocations. But all writers are guided by their own affinities. Both Crispin and Morgan, for instance, train their eyes on the portions of Anderson’s life that hew most closely to their own; Morgan notes, in the introduction, that before following in Anderson’s editorial footsteps, he moved to Chicago “exactly one hundred summers after Margaret did the same,” and attended grad school next door to the building where The Little Review’s offices had been housed. It’s no coincidence that the sections of the book that mirror his own life are the ones that shine most brightly.

Every work of biography, no matter its scope, attempts the impossible: to impose order and meaning on a person’s existence. And every attempt tends to emphasize the inherent chasm between a life and books about a life. The case of Margaret Anderson, who shook the literary landscape and then all but renounced it, brings this tension to the fore. She seems almost to dare her biographers to wrangle her, to make her life make sense. The editor in her might have liked to see them try.

            <h2>Democratic Bosses Are Launching a Remake of the 2028 Calendar</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/democrats-2028-iowa-new-hampshire-nevada/685628/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The caucus gyms of first-in-the-nation Iowa transformed Barack Obama from curiosity to contender in 2008. Black-church networks in South Carolina handed Joe Biden the Democratic nomination in 2020. If not for the restaurants and bowling lanes of New Hampshire, Bill Clinton’s campaign and career would likely have been, to borrow a phrase, as dead as the “last dog” in 1992.

Picking Democratic presidential nominees in the United States, in other words, has always been a concocted local game. Even after Democratic leaders decided in the early 1970s to empower regular people through primaries and open caucuses, they kept a grip on the schedule of contests and the rules by which delegates are selected and can act. Rather than aspiring to provide equal representation, party bosses designed the system to give voters in some states more sway than those in others.

Now the Democratic Party is trying to decide what type of voters it wants to shape its attempt to regain the White House in 2028. Three years after then-President Biden effectively eliminated the Democratic nominating competition by reordering early contests in his favor, the party’s Rules and Bylaws Committee has invited all 57 states and territories to apply by tomorrow for pole position in the reshuffled 2028 calendar. The result, expected to be announced later this year, will reset the playing field for Democratic aspirants to the world’s most powerful job—and likely anger those who feel cut out.

Even though the party has the power to do virtually anything it wants, conversation has once again largely centered on the handful of states that have led the calendar for decades. Iowa Democrats, who appear likely to be shut out of the early-nominating window for the second cycle after a disastrous 2020, are openly discussing the option of going rogue and holding an unsanctioned early caucus. The New Hampshire and Nevada state parties are lobbying to be the first-in-the-nation primary state, and New Hampshire is threatening to hold a meaningless first contest if it doesn’t win the prize. South Carolina, which has represented the nation’s Black Democratic electorate in the early window since 2004 and went first in 2024, wants to stay there, but other southern states—including Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina—are expected to jockey to crowd in on their traditional importance.

At stake is not just a geographic advantage or disadvantage for prospective candidates, but the prospect of windfalls for local-television stations and roadside-hotel chains, as candidates devote tens of millions of dollars to winning early contests in hopes of slingshotting in popularity. The result could also give Republicans, who plan to stick to the traditional early-state order of Iowa and New Hampshire, a general-election advantage in states where Democrats are trying to regain statewide office. Entire campaigns could rise or fall on the outcomes. Quentin Fulks, who worked as the principal deputy campaign manager for the Democratic ticket in 2024 and has been discussed as a potential campaign manager in 2028, described the calendar order as a weight on the scale of the whole contest.

“It’s essentially a filter on the party’s future, determining which voters are heard first, which issues shape the race, and which candidates remain viable by the time the rest of the country weighs in,” Fulks told me; he has previously worked for Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker and Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia. “We should be clear-eyed about there being advantages for specific candidates in whatever order is chosen.”

This year’s fight has already created some unlikely allies and shuffled allegiances. Twenty years ago, Donna Brazile, fresh off a turn as campaign manager for Al Gore’s 2000 presidential bid, celebrated the addition of Nevada and South Carolina to the top of the calendar as a win for racial and ethnic diversity in the party. This year, she told me, her focus has shifted.

“I think the most important thing is that the party needs to look at how to woo independents, because without independents, Democrats cannot win in 2028,” Brazile said. That means, as a member of the Democratic National Committee’s Rules and Bylaws Committee, she is looking favorably at restoring New Hampshire—where roughly 90 percent of residents are white and the largest share of voters are “undeclared” for either political party—to its historic position as the first primary contest. She also said that she has some doubts about South Carolina because it has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976, and she hopes other southern states enter the conversation. “I am open to a southern state, but I don’t believe I am necessarily open to South Carolina. I am all about the Electoral College. Period. End of sentence,” she said.

South Carolina stumbled into first place during the 2024 cycle because Biden chose to overrule DNC deliberations to make his path to the nomination as seamless as possible. Now the state that never asked to go first is defending its position, though many of its voters will be happy if it retains some place in the calendar before Super Tuesday. “We are 100 percent defending our position for first,” Jay Parmley, the executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party, told me. He added that if the committee declines, it will “have to explain away removing a primary for a southern state with Black and rural voters.” He also said that South Carolina welcomes another southern state joining the early window, as long as his remains.

Nevada state leaders, meanwhile, sent holiday cards and candy canes to the committee members late last year. The cards feature a prickly Joshua tree wearing a Santa hat, and an invocation to “keep fighting the good fight” from “your friends in Nevada.” There are plans to distribute “Nevada First” poker chips to the committee in the coming months, according to people involved in the process. Four years ago, Nevada felt that it was on the verge of winning first-primary blessings, only to have Biden impose his will. It doesn’t want to see the chance slip away again.

“Nevada is what America is,” Artie Blanco, one of the state’s two members on the committee, told me, before listing off stats about the state’s ethnic diversity, low number of college graduates, and powerful unions, not to mention its razor-thin margins in recent elections.

But New Hampshire is in a stronger position now that Biden, who finished fifth there in 2020, has left the scene. Unlike everywhere else, the New Hampshire secretary of state is empowered to choose the state’s primary date at the last minute, and, by state law, he must select one that occurs ahead of any other presidential primary in the nation. In practice, this means that if Democrats don’t let New Hampshire go first, New Hampshire will go first anyway with a contest that doesn’t count toward the nomination—a loss that could sting in a purple state. It could also shut Democratic candidates out of valuable news cycles as the Republican primary in the state takes center stage. Lawmakers in the state, who are facing contested statewide 2026 races for governor and U.S. senator, are likely to make the point loudly that the party stands to lose if it shows again that it doesn’t care. “We certainly aren’t taking anything for granted,” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told me.

These words will likely please some potential 2028 candidates, such as Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, and Pritzker, who all found time last year to visit the state. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel also signaled to my colleague Ashley Parker that he sees a first-in-the-nation New Hampshire as a potential springboard to the top tier. Other possible candidates, such as Maryland Governor Wes Moore, visited South Carolina last year, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared for a town hall in Iowa. (Another potential presidential contender and Nevada neighbor, California Governor Gavin Newsom, is my cousin. I do not report on him and am not involved in coverage of him.)

Some party leaders with close ties to Buckley and DNC Chair Ken Martin have suggested that they hold early sympathy for New Hampshire reclaiming kickoff status. “The folks on Rules and Bylaws understand that state laws and state governance will truly matter with who is in the first four states,” Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb told me. “This is not a ‘Well, we hope the calendar looks like this.’ This is a very practical decision.”

None of that bodes well for Iowa, which starting in 1972 carved out an enormously powerful place as the first contest in the Democratic presidential saga. That fell apart in 2020, when the party, already struggling to hold any statewide office, failed to produce a clear caucus winner for days because of a technological glitch. Biden effectively erased the state from the 2024 process. After Iowa’s leaders declined to support Martin’s bid for DNC chair, Iowa lost its seat on the Rules and Bylaws Committee, even though the representation of South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Nevada doubled to two. Martin distanced himself from that decision by delegating the committee selection to other party members.

The state known for nice is now shifting closer to war footing. “All options are on the table for Iowa Democrats in 2028,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart told me in a statement. “No matter what the Rules and Bylaws Committee decides, Republican presidential candidates will be in Iowa. It was a mistake for the DNC to cut us out of the calendar, letting Republicans’ attacks go unanswered in Iowa while millions of dollars in advertising, organizing and the worldwide media flooded our state.”

One Iowa Democrat told me that the unspoken threat is a “rogue” caucus, which would occur outside of the Democratic nominating process at the same time that Republicans are campaigning in the state. “Part of it depends on if we think the process was fair and we get a fair shake,” this person said, requesting anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Such a move could lead some candidates for president to campaign for a caucus win even if it wouldn’t award delegates, in the hopes of raising their public profile. In the past, the DNC has threatened to strip convention delegates from states that hold contests outside of the rules. In 2008, the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina pressured major Democratic candidates to pledge that they would not even campaign in Michigan and Florida, which were defying the rules.

Under the committee’s rules, four or five states will get special permission to go in the early window of contests, and they will include a single state from each of the nation’s party-recognized regions: the West, the Midwest, the South, and the East. Michigan, which was put in the early schedule in 2024, is expected to seek to maintain its spot, though Democrats expect the total number of applicants for an early role to be fewer than the 20 states and territories that applied in 2022. As before, the committee will decide on a group of finalists to offer more formal presentations.

Without a sitting president to disrupt the process this time, party leaders have established a vague three-pronged test to decide the outcome: “The Rules and Bylaws Committee is committed to running a rigorous, efficient, and fair process that will deliver the strongest presidential nominee for our party,” Jim Roosevelt and Minyon Moore, who lead the committee, told me in a statement. But as with everything in party politics, such principles are easily subsumed by horse trading and individual influence. After the bosses decide, the nation’s Democratic candidates and voters will have to make do.</div>

            <h2>Elizabeth Warren’s Abundant Mistakes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/elizabeth-warren-democrats-billionaires/685615/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Democratic Party has two competing plans to “pick up the broken pieces from the 2024 election,” claimed Elizabeth Warren, in a widely touted speech she delivered Monday at the National Press Club. “One vision says that we should shape our agenda and temper our rhetoric to flatter any fabulously rich person looking for a political party that will entrench their own economic interests,” she argued. The other vision—hers, as you might guess—is noble and pure.

Warren’s account of the party’s internal divide is nonsensical demagoguery. Almost nobody in the Democratic Party—perhaps literally nobody—believes it should design its message to flatter selfish billionaires.

But the existence of an internal schism is quite real. And the fact that Warren, who has long styled herself as an intellectual and political leader of the party’s progressive faction, must resort to grotesque mischaracterization of her opponents within the Democratic Party is an indication of how poorly the argument has gone for her side over the past year and a half.

The actual claim moderates tend to make about why their party lost in 2024 is that Kamala Harris was unable to credibly separate herself from the toxic social-policy stances she adopted during her 2020 campaign—the highest-profile being her promise to support taxpayer-financed gender-reassignment surgeries for prisoners and detained migrants. She also did too little to distance herself from the Biden administration’s unpopular governing record.

Many progressives reject that analysis, especially the first part, which implies that the party needs to abandon unpopular positions. They argue that the social views held by a majority of the electorate are (as one progressive strategist put it) “unacceptable.” Rather than compromise with the holders of those unacceptable beliefs, Democrats can simply focus public attention on the evils of the billionaire class, a message thought to be powerful enough to overcome the political drag created by any nonnegotiable social-policy stances.

Warren’s speech articulates this strategy—though it might be more accurate to say that it carries out this strategy by ignoring or mischaracterizing the views of her internal Democratic Party critics and instead depicting them as puppets of the wealthy.

In her speech, Warren repeatedly argued that the moderate analysis of Democrats’ shortcomings is that they lost because they offended rich people and therefore failed to raise enough money. She decried “the temptation—in this moment of national crisis—to sand down our edges to avoid offending anyone, especially the rich and powerful who might finance our candidates.” She insisted, “A Democratic Party that worries more about offending big donors than delivering for working people is a party that is doomed to fail.”

Jonathan Chait: Democrats still have no idea what went wrong

Revealingly, Warren did not cite any Democrat who holds this supposedly influential belief. Through insinuation, however, she tried to associate it with advocates of the abundance agenda. “Reid Hoffman is sending everyone he knows a copy of Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book on abundance and backing pro-abundance candidates,” she warned. “Running on small, vague ideas that may also raise costs for families—instead of on full-throated, economic populist ideas—is a terrible plan for winning elections.”

In fact, the abundance agenda is neither small nor vague, nor a plan for winning elections. It is not a political strategy but a set of policy arguments that have caught the attention of liberal intellectuals. The agenda, in short, argues that cities should permit more housing to be built, that the government should make building public infrastructure easier, and that the government has been too bound up by procedures and regulations that prevent swift action.

The abundance agenda is designed to make it easier for government to carry out the energetic work that progressives desire, which has inspired an earnest debate over its wonky particulars. Yet it has drawn withering fire from the left, perhaps because it points the finger at progressives themselves for tying up government in knots. In particular, it blames left-leaning interest groups for upholding well-intentioned rules that make governing costly and slow and that freeze the built environment in place. Progressives such as Warren believe in maintaining a firm alliance with the very groups that the abundance agenda blames.

The abundance agenda intersects with the political arguments moderates have made, because both the abundance proponents and the moderates decry the excessive influence of the groups. Many people who believe Democrats should move to the center also embrace the abundance agenda as a set of governing priorities. Despite their somewhat common set of targets, however, abundance proponents and moderates are not the same thing.

The biggest reason some progressives detest the abundance agenda seems to be  that they, like Warren, genuinely adhere to the populist analysis of American politics, which takes it as axiomatic that every problem is caused by nefarious wealthy interests.

At one point in her speech, for instance, Warren claimed that Donald Trump “is trying to push out the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and complete his corrupt takeover of America’s central bank—so that it serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends’.” Is it true that Trump’s billionaire friends would benefit from undermining central-bank independence? The billionaires don’t seem especially excited about this aspect of Trump’s power grab. An alternate explanation for Trump’s behavior is that, rather than carrying out a clever plan to enrich his allies, he doesn’t understand monetary policy very well. To the populist monomaniac, however, there are no dumb ideas, only plots.

The abundance agenda, by contrast, is premised on the belief that at least some problems do stem from misconceived ideas, including the left-wing variety. The abundance proponents do not defend the role of the wealthy, nor do they imply that Democrats should steer clear of taxing the rich and regulating harmful business practices. (Most of the prominent advocates of the abundance agenda, including Klein and Thompson, favor such steps.) They simply call attention to the existence of some problems that are not entirely the fault of billionaires.

Elaine Godfrey: What happened to Elizabeth Warren?

If you are unable to imagine any economic problem that is not the product of billionaire greed, then you naturally assume that anybody who sees the world differently is a tool of the rich. Yet the Democratic Party is completely unified on the merits of raising taxes on the rich and spending more on benefits for the poor and middle class. Its true divide concerns Warren’s fixation with wealthy interests as the source of all evils, and whether this political style offers the party a path to the majority.

We have three broad ways to measure the political appeal of Warren’s message. First, she has run for Senate three times. She has won those races. But because she is a Democrat in Massachusetts, one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic states in America, winning alone tells us little about her appeal. The election-data-analytics firm Split Ticket found that in 2018 and 2024, Warren ran 9.4 points and 10.8 points below the vote share that a generic Democrat would have attained—making her one of the party’s poorest performers each cycle. The database in that measurement does not include 2012, the year Warren first ran for Senate, but in that race she ran seven points behind Barack Obama in her state, even though Obama was facing Mitt Romney, the state’s well-regarded former governor, at the top of the ticket.

Second, Warren ran for president in 2020 and performed miserably. Lots of candidates ran in that cycle and failed to break through. Warren attracted huge amounts of donor support; the media covered her like a front-runner. Her problem was that the voters simply didn’t choose her. She finished third in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire and Nevada, and fifth in South Carolina before dropping out after losing her home state. Her high-profile defeat did not inspire any obvious recriminations. Warren’s campaign memoir expresses bewilderment that her successful courting of progressive activists did not translate into votes among Black and Latino primary voters, without questioning whether those activists represented large numbers of real voters as opposed to just the progressive donors who funded their work.

Third, and most revealingly, despite crashing and burning in the primary, Warren built enough prestige among Democratic Party elites to gain deep influence over both the staffing and the policy agenda of its ultimate victor. As the nominee and as president, Joe Biden adopted many of Warren’s campaign proposals, co-authored an op-ed with her, and frequently solicited her advice. “President Joe Biden is enlisting a small army of her former aides and allies to run his government,” reported Politico in 2021.

How did Warren’s speech process the humbling fact that her policy blueprint was implemented, and Americans rejected it at the ballot box? Mostly by ignoring the entire four years.

The moderates have blamed Harris for failing to separate herself from Biden—most infamously, when she told The View that she couldn’t think of a single policy on which she differed from him. In the speech, Warren’s only specific criticism of Harris’s relationship to Biden came when she attacked her for failing to pledge to keep Lina Khan, a Warren favorite, as head of the Federal Trade Commission. (Warren, of course, blames this decision on billionaires.)

Jonathan Chait: The coming Democratic civil war

Warren’s speech also insisted that “we can’t rebuild trust by excommunicating Biden-administration law enforcers who, for the first time in decades, actually fought to hold corporations accountable for driving up prices.”

Excommunication in general is a rather stringent penalty that ought to be employed only for serious offenses, and ideally by a church. Still, it is revealing that Warren’s only takeaway from the Biden administration is that the Democrats should bind themselves to keeping his staff in place indefinitely.

Warren blithely credited the Biden aides with holding corporations “accountable for driving up prices.” But did this actually prevent inflation? Or did it at least make the public give Biden credit for fighting inflation? The answer to both is no. Yet this is the blueprint she demands the party follow into the future.

In the airtight world of populist logic, no evidence for Warren’s beliefs is necessary. Blaming corporations for any given problem is self-evidently correct, and failing to embrace this logic can be explained only by corruption. Warren has put Democrats on notice that if they resist her moral certitude, she will question their integrity. The lesson they should draw from her speech is that, if they want to build a majority more durable than Biden’s, questioning Warren’s dogma is a necessity.</div>

            <h2>MAGA’s Jewish Intellectuals Helped Create Their Own Predicament</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/jewish-maga-intellectuals-responsibility/685601/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At a Turning Point USA conference in December, the podcaster Ben Shapiro delivered a speech that was hailed as the sort of moral stand one rarely encounters in the age of polarization. Confronting the right’s surging anti-Semitism, he denounced two of its most popular peddlers—Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens—by name. Speaking at a Heritage Foundation event the day before, Shapiro had called for “ideological border control,” a purge of the haters from the movement.

It was a brave foray into intramural politics, but also a damning self-indictment. Not so many years ago, Shapiro was guilty of the very thing he now decries. The Daily Wire, of which he is a co-founder and part owner, hired Owens in 2020. Even before she arrived, there were signs of where she was headed: “If Hitler had just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine,” she had told a crowd in London in 2018. Shapiro’s company ignored that and subsequent warnings. When Kanye West went on an anti-Semitic tear in 2022, Owens rushed to his defense: “It’s like you cannot even say the word ‘Jewish’ without people getting upset.”

That incident was the moment for border control. Shapiro refused. “We allow disagreement at The Daily Wire,” he said, “even when I think that some of my colleagues are wrong.” No wonder anti-Semitism crept toward the movement’s mainstream.

For a time, it was possible for the Jewish intellectuals of MAGA—a small but influential set of podcasters, columnists, and theorists—to minimize anti-Semitism in the movement. But it’s now so ubiquitous and so noxious that even they can’t ignore it. Joel Pollak, the former editor in chief of Breitbart News, wrote on X in December that, until a few months before, he would have happily sent his children to a Turning Point USA event. Not anymore. “Now: why would I send them to one more place where Jewish kids have to defend who they are and what they believe?”

From the April 2024 issue: The Golden Age of American Jews is ending

But Pollak, Shapiro, and others were delusional in denying the problem for so long. They built careers inside a movement animated by fantasies about “globalists,” suspicions of hidden hands, and a yearning for national purity—an ideological combination that has never been particularly healthy for Jews. They lent their prestige to it anyway, certain that the hateful rhetoric was meant for someone else. Now that it has landed directly on them, they want credit for noticing the stench.

No case is sadder than the Israeli American political theorist Yoram Hazony—a Princeton and Rutgers graduate who ran a conservative think tank in Jerusalem, but saw Trump and the American right’s bubbling hostility toward classical liberalism as his chance to break out on a larger stage. In 2018, he published The Virtue of Nationalism, not a flame-throwing manifesto so much as a homely defense of nationalism as the natural way to organize a polity—an argument he traced back to biblical times.

Hazony didn’t just write about the revolt against liberalism; he became one of its leading impresarios. He convened regular gatherings of what he called the “National Conservatives,” a melange of theocrats and populists, and grasped for a new coalition that might provide the bedrock ideology of right-wing political parties throughout the Western world. Rising Republican politicians including J. D. Vance and Josh Hawley headlined these conferences, which, for several years, were the hottest tickets on the right.

Under the National Conservative banner, the right was swerving from classical liberalism to nationalism, away from the most American of American ideas: that the United States is held together by a creed rather than a bloodline. Hazony’s movement didn’t merely sneer at “wokeness”; it sneered at the pluralist project, articulated movingly by George Washington himself, that enabled Jews to flourish in the U.S. in the first place. Say what you will about the Enlightenment; at least it emancipated Jews.

While Hazony projected a mild image, his conferences were bombastic. When my colleague David Brooks attended one in 2021, he walked away gobsmacked by the “callousness, invocations of combat, and whiffs of brutality.” His dispatch from the conference was titled “The Terrifying Future of the American Right.”

Jewish history supplied a pretty good preview of what that terrifying future might look like. Four years after Brooks attended Hazony’s conference, it has unmistakably arrived. Each week brings a new instance of anti-Semitism moving from the internet’s febrile periphery into the conservative movement’s mainstream. A leaked text chain from the New York Young Republicans included the line “Great. I love Hitler.” Tucker Carlson, arguably the movement’s most popular personality, hosted Holocaust deniers on his show. Kevin Roberts, the head of the Heritage Foundation, rose to Carlson’s defense by dismissing the host’s critics as a “venomous coalition”—language that echoed old insinuations about a Jewish cabal pulling the strings. (Roberts eventually apologized.)

When Hazony convened the National Conservatives in September, he felt obliged to address the matter of surging anti-Semitism. He told the crowd that he’d been “pretty amazed by the depth of the slander of Jews as a people” online. Then he made what would surely count as one of the most naive statements ever offered at a political conference, at least if it could be judged sincere. “I didn’t think it would happen on the right,” he said. “I was mistaken.”

But contained in his speech were clues that perhaps he wasn’t as surprised as he claimed to be. For years, he said, he had defended his comrades against accusations of anti-Semitism. “It makes you really popular,” he said. “Everybody is really grateful: I’m the guy who defended them against absolutely false, ridiculous accusations of anti-Semitism.”

What did this long history of loyalty buy MAGA’s Jewish intellectuals? Several days after Shapiro addressed the Turning Point USA conference, Vance took the same stage. Because of all the attention Shapiro’s speech had received, Vance was compelled to address his concerns. But when the time came to evict Holocaust deniers and conspiracists from the movement, Vance chose a different path. He rejected “purity tests,” telling the crowd, “I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to deplatform.” Vance spectacularly failed Shapiro’s moral test. And yet, Shapiro said nothing critical in response. He stayed silent, and evidently chose to preserve his relationship with the Republican Party’s heir apparent. In other words, Shapiro failed the moral test he himself wrote.

Yair Rosenberg: J. D. Vance’s bad answer to an anti-Semitic question

Despite all their bellyaching, the Jewish intellectuals of MAGA still hesitate to wage civil war or break ranks. After wringing his hands about anti-Semitism on the right, Hazony turned around and defended Roberts as he was besieged by accusations of anti-Semitism: “I’ll never forget how the jackals circled, sniveling for blood,” Hazony said. Sniveling is an interesting choice of words, given all the feeble excuses that Hazony has made for his allies.</div>

That&#39;s... not what&#39;s going on here. Wikipedia is licensing it&#39;s content for these AI companies to crawl for training their models. Presumably to, at minimum, pay for the bandwidth they&#39;re using.

Yeah, I realized this after I posted it... jumped to conclusions before reading the article in typical /. fashion. :PEven better, you didn&#39;t even finish reading the first paragraph of the summary.  Excellent work!

Even better, you didn&#39;t even finish reading the first paragraph of the summary.  Excellent work!

Because that would make their blatant theft of human knowledge be even more obvious copyright infringement, I guess... At least now they&#39;re paying for it.

Bandwidth is cheaper than storage. Apparently.

Wikipedia has terms of service that means you give up limited rights when you contribute to it.  As such, they decide whether AI gets access to it.

Being a free service to the general public, it is totally reasonably to charge special users to use it.

This is a great way to fund the the general public&#39;s use, especially considering how the AI community has in general disregarded authors rights.   Better to charge them up front.

Agreed. And without that deal, the slop-makers would just steal everything anyways.

Being a free service to the general public, it is totally reasonably to charge special users to use it.More importantly, AI companies are going to scrape the site regardless of it being allowed or not. What this does is gives them firm legal standing that companies doing so are causing them financial losses.

Otherwise the AI pushers would just steal everything and cause damage to availability on top of that.

Wikipedia is completely unbiased! It’s crowd-sourced! And the crowd only uses approved sources:

With Wikipedia, our AI’s are guaranteed to be benign overlords!

A fan of  &quot;doing your own research&quot; I take it.

If people get more efficient using AI, then people will be fired.

Greed is blinded by greed.  Doesn’t matter how smart they are or were when that shit takes over.

When the threat of AI/AGI first came on, most arrogant meatsacks assumed it would take Perfect AI to replace them at their job.

Most fallible humans don’t realize it will only take Good E. Nuff AI to replace them.  Because that is exactly how they landed their human job in the first place.  You were good enough to hire.  Nowhere near perfect.

The need for UBI will happen far sooner than Greed N. Corruption realizes.  That doesn’t put Greed in charge.  That puts Greed on the fucking menu.  With Mass Chaos in charge.

It did not hurt to have a new circus in charge of destabilizing the economy to the point most companies would cut back at the same time, to greater lengths than before.

I happen to know a lot of factory workers and am well aware of how broken their bodies are.  While some places push for ergonomics, many just see it as a hassle.  Then you have some jobs such as plumbing or HVAC which just break you down over time because they were never designed in a way to be maintained.

You may not have to carry the very heaviest loads, but plumbing may require things like digging trenches, lifting heavy objects (like porcelain toilets), and dealing with literal shit.

Not to mention that $60,000 a year for a starting salary is peanuts in 2025. You can barely feed and house yourself with that salary in high cost of living states, let alone feed a family.

That might have been a livable wage 20 years ago, but now it&#39;s just a small step over the minimum wage of $17 a hour in states like California and New York.

There is a continued push to convince people to do things, or have their kids do things, the speaker won&#39;t do themselves:- Join the military- Skip college- Take up the trades- Nursing!- Do manual, unskilled labor

Which is of course is why everyone is so manic about ICE, for the last 40 years we have been fed the propoganda that immigration is inevitable.

People are manic about ICE because they&#39;ve been given free rein to kidnap and now even murder people, people who aren&#39;t even here illegally, and who aren&#39;t even foreign nationals, with the full support of the president and his fully owned justice department.

People aren&#39;t manic because of your utterly moronic conspiracy theories. Watch the fucking video.

Know how I know you didn&#39;t watch the video of ICE murdering Good?

Yeah safer not to watch it. Couldn&#39;t have your stupid conspiracy theories challenged by actual facts.

Wait... Ice was trying to arrest the president?

Watch ALL of the videos - not just the ones curated by “defund the police” geniuses.

&quot;tech sales professionals&quot; isn&#39;t that a white collar job? And director of multiple car-repair shop locations as well.

I seriously looked into this when I was unemployed for 6 months as a marketing designer. I&#39;m pretty handy with construction and have done many remodels on my own. I have friends in construction who make a similar salary, but they all have supervisory and licensed roles and have been doing it for many years and it would take me many years to get the same place. I&#39;m currently in my 40s.

Also, some fields require significant training, certifications and tests like electricians. The inner kid in me also kind of

I worked my way through college as an auto mechanic.  It&#39;s the shittiest job on earth.  Is there a shortage of auto mechanics?  Yes.  And there&#39;s a reason for that.  It&#39;s back breaking work, almost always without heat or air conditioning.  You bleed on the job every single day.  I had to buy thousands of dollars of tools.  Long term techs end up with six figures worth of tools, all paid for themselves.

But the worst part is the pay.  Flat Rate.  There&#39;s a book that says how long a specific repair should take, and you get paid that.  If it says 3 hours, and a rusted bolt breaks off and you spend an extra 2 hours extracting it, you don&#39;t get paid for that.  If it&#39;s a slow day and there isn&#39;t work to do, you don&#39;t get paid for that.  If a customer doesn&#39;t pay their bill, you don&#39;t get paid for that either.

The only way to make money as an auto mechanic is to rip people off.  Cut corners.  Recommend unnecessary service and then don&#39;t actually do it.  If you feel like you get ripped off at the repair shop - it&#39;s Flat Rate.  No honest mechanic can make a living.

There&#39;s no freaking way a &quot;service advisor&quot; makes $120k.  That&#39;s the guy at the counter you talk to when you walk in, and they&#39;re the dumbest people in the whole shop.

Directors overseeing multiple locations earn more than $200,000.This is not a blue-collar job: this is business management. Counting them as &quot;blue-collar&quot; because they manage blue-collar workers is a huge stretch. And when the economy tanks (we&#39;re probably already in a recession), these blue-collar jobs disappear first.  Work in a trade if you like. I have nothing but respect for people who work for a living. But it&#39;s not a panacea and blue collar work comes with its own challenges (it&#39;s hard on your body, particularly as you age), there&#39;s limits on upward mobility in most blue-collar positions, and perhaps it is harder to replace a blue-collar job with AI but there are plenty of robots, machines, and engineering innovations that will replace you just as quickly.

I&#39;m 61 and a laid-off IT Project Manager.  I&#39;m looking at going into other areas, and interviewed for a position managing facilities upgrade and construction projects.

My fallback (and it&#39;s looking more likely) is that I take early retirement and work as a security guard.  I&#39;m in a fortunate position in that my house is paid off and my adult kids live with us and are able to help with the bills.

Neither of my kids work in technology.  One is in HVAC and the other is in the mental health field.

Yes, white collar workers should be glad to move down from the middle class to the lower one. Also, they should be glad to do physically demanding work that will be increasing hard on their bodies as they age. And they should be glad to fucking suck it.

Accept that your future has been stolen from you and drop down the socioeconomic ladder. The owner class no longer wants to pay you what you&#39;re worth, so what you&#39;re worth is less today than it was yesterday. Accept it. And STFU about how much you spent on education that we demanded you to get to be qualified for a life of mediocrity in the office. Now you can live a life of LESSER mediocrity in the plant. And fuck you for trying to climb, you selfish asshole.

The &quot;blue collar&quot; jobs cited in the original post are sales jobs. The &quot;service advisor&quot; is the salesperson for a car repair shop. The &quot;PE backed construction company&quot; explicitly says the numbers are for sales. Given that most sales jobs are heavily commission based, it&#39;s pretty likely that the numbers cited for salaries are rosy projections that only the most productive salespeople will reach. These jobs aren&#39;t much different from selling cars. They have very little to do with being an auto mechanic or skilled tradesperson.

The point is that the previous abysmal inability to do math correctly has ingrain the idea that LLMs cannot do math and cannot be trusted for even basic math results. So, no matter how good or accurate future LLMs get at math, they will never be trusted.

Like many things with LLMs, if the user has to fact check everything manually, then the LLM is just creating work and wasting time. Not helpful.

Now, the realist in me fully accepts that the masses will happily continue to use LLMs for everything and that the

FWIW, I despise MSWindows for the company behind it.  I haven&#39;t used the actual products for decades, and am willing to accept that they may have improved technically.  Their license hasn&#39;t.

When I switched to Linux, Linux was far inferior technically.  It didn&#39;t even have a decent word processor.  But my dislike of MSWindows was so intense that I switched anyway.

In the case of LLMs, here we&#39;re arguing about technical merit rather than things like &quot;can you trust it not to abuse the information it collects ab

You described the typical slashdot mentality.

So far, I have to agree.  I have yet to see one that can get &quot;What is 1337% of Pi?&quot; correct.

I didn&#39;t read the article but the summary says that it found an existing solution to a related problem. So it got a head start and from there it knew where to start looking and &quot;reasoning&quot;. It is not yet clear that it would have found its solution from a cold start.

TBH, the majority of Math problems are solved this way, even from humans. We&#39;re always building on top of other&#39;s work.

Yes, I know that. The point is that (LLMs restricted to math problems) != mathematicians.

If that&#39;s your point, a better argument would be that it didn&#39;t select the math problem to work on.  Which is almost certainly true.

Indeed. I just had a look at LLMs and code security bugs via a student thesis. Turns out the simple teaching examples got 100%, things showing up in security patches like 40% and CVEs (the vulnerabilities that actually matter) close to 0%. That test included paid models and coding models. Oh, and some gave a lot of irrelevant trash on top of the answers asked for.

Hence no skills at all, no insight, just statistical pattern matching and adaption of things found in the training data. No surprise. The whole th

It&#39;s not like the AIs are doing this on a single request.  It&#39;s pretty obvious we&#39;re talking about skilled mathematicians using tools.  Just the same as skilled coders making faster progress on application development.

Define &quot;true intelligence&quot;.  In the case the search domain wasn&#39;t &quot;stuff the people have done&quot;, but rather &quot;stuff that can be validly derived from stuff people have done via valid mathematical operations&quot;.  It basically needed to generate the area it was searching in.  I&#39;m not sure how much of what people do can&#39;t be expressed that way, if you replace &quot;validly derived&quot; by &quot;guess is most likely&quot;.

Indeed. But too many people seem to be lacking in natural intelligence or the skills to apply it. And hence they are deeply impressed by this meaningless stunt.

> raising new questions about large language models&#39; ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge

At this point, it should be *inhuman* knowledge

Nah.  As long as at least one person understands it, it counts as &quot;human knowledge&quot;.

Otherwise the proof of the &quot;four color theorem&quot; would be when computers pushed beyond human knowledge.  (That one was so long that no one human understood all of the proof.)

The tools were being used by highly skilled mathematicians who knew what to ask and how to verify. Moreover, the there was nothing novel, just recombining known theory. Wake me when an AI wins a Fields Medal.

This is just gaming of benchmarks. Entirely meaningless. LLMs cannot even solve simple math problems on their own. They can only do what was in their training data and simplistic, no-insight-required statistical combinations of that.

Will be on shaky ground to copyright anything derived from AI.

Even the inference of AI is enough to send some IPs into unknown regions of law.

And since GW is all about directing as much cash from their cows... I mean customers into their own koffers, we can&#39;t jeopardize the copyright. Imagine if someone suddenly could lawfully reproduce their products or worse yet, if people could print the figures themselves.

They may just have looked at how much time AI use &quot;saves&quot;. The reality is, not a lot. And as soon as you take cost and quality into account, it typically makes things more expensive. Effects of staff experience, stress-levels, slopifications are not yet accounted for in that, and hence the cost disadvantage of using generative AI my even be a lot worse overall than is currently known and established.

Let&#39;s understand that GW has a little bit of luxury here, the sort of cushion you have when your crap is ridiculously overpriced (thus the &quot;robust&quot; results report).

Well, I guess at least their tech-priests are allowed to use machine spirits as long as they perform the correct rites.

You don&#39;t need AI to find holes in a GW rules set, you just need to play one once :)

The IP issues mentioned above are probably legit: GW exists because it creates a lot of IP and zealously protects it.

Last week, the fruits of the Department of Homeland Security’s burgeoning gestapo tactics came into full view. On Wednesday in Minneapolis, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her car. On Thursday in Portland, Oregon, a federal Border Patrol agent shot and wounded Luis David Nino-Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras in their pickup truck. Three unarmed people shot by federal officers within the span of 36 hours.

The administration claims that in both Minneapolis and Portland, the drivers were “domestic terrorists” who “weaponized” their vehicles, that the officers acted in self-defense, that they fired their guns to save their lives. In the first case, we have video to disprove it. In the second, unless a video surfaces, it will be the agent’s word against the victims’.

We should no longer be surprised by the Trump administration’s lies. But it remains surprising that its members continue to stick doggedly to their story in the face of unambiguous video evidence contradicting it. Donald Trump has said that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” that he was injured, and that “it is hard to believe he is alive.” But in the clearest of the videos, Good inches forward, then waits for other vehicles to pass. Two officers march toward the driver’s side of her SUV. “Get out of the fucking car,” one says. As Good slowly reverses, one officer yanks at the driver’s-side door handle and reaches through the window. Good points her wheels to the right and begins to pull forward away from the agents. Ross crosses in front of the car, grabs his gun, points it directly at her, and fires through the windshield. Stepping back, he keeps firing as the car moves on. The vehicle never touches him. After he has shot Good, he casually approaches the SUV, looks inside, then strides comfortably away.

It looks like an execution. And yet, far from giving officers pause, the video seems to have goosed them up to further violence. Footage of assaults in the past few days show a set of standard tactics: multiple officers surround their target’s car, take out hammers and smash the windshield or windows, drag the driver out, and tackle, handcuff, and arrest them. In one video, at least eight ICE officers surround a woman’s car. She cries out that she’s a U.S. citizen trying to get to a doctor, as a cascade of glass hits her. The officers slash her seat belt, slam her to the ground, then throw her against the vehicle and handcuff her. In another, a man covered in glass and pinned down by three agents shouts, “Help me!,” and a bystander yells, “He’s not fucking resisting!” As the officers handcuff him, one puts his knee on the man’s neck and bears down. In a third, at least four Border Patrol officers drag a man out of his car, pile on top of him, and crush his face into the ground till he appears to pass out. Other officers fire pepper balls at the protesting witnesses. One man tries to film the scene as an officer marches toward him and shouts, “You go back there one more time and I’m going to put you under arrest!” Back there is the only place the camera can fully capture the officers’ brutality.

We live in extreme times. A president has been sending armies into our cities to hunt people down and kill if necessary. So it is not surprising that the media’s discussion of the shootings has focused on their relationship to our anomalous political moment: Trump’s war on immigration; the mass protests; the polarization that has produced radically divergent accounts of the shootings. But if we focus only on Trump-era lawlessness, we risk missing something equally important to these events but far more systemic and enduring: the quiet success of a long campaign to neutralize video evidence of police brutality, leaving officers secure in the belief that the law cannot touch them.

By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, phone cameras were everywhere. They showed us the culture of police violence as never before, but they also seemed to promise a different future. In 2010 one civil rights lawyer confidently proclaimed that our cameras would democratize evidence and bring about “real justice.” A few years later, the lawyer for Freddie Gray—killed while shackled in the back of a police van—declared, “Thank God for cellphone video cameras, because now the truth is finally coming out.”

The truth did come out, sometimes at least. But truth failed to do what we thought it would. That failure was not accidental but the result of an organized program dedicated to shielding officers from even the most damning footage. From the moment phone cameras began capturing police violence, conservative organizations, police unions, and their allies mobilized. They worked on multiple fronts: financing elections of sympathetic officials and judges, campaigning against the others, producing legislation limiting the camera’s reach, and intervening in precedent-setting court cases. They had three central aims: to block our cameras, to make it easy to suppress or destroy incriminating video, and, when these avenues failed, to alter what the video seemed to show through clever editing, the fabrication of supplementary evidence, and the repetition of lies till they hardened into fact. It was a full program of video gaslighting.

This campaign has succeeded for many reasons, among them the nearly unlimited power officers have to charge those they assault with “resisting arrest” or “obstruction of justice” (deflecting charges from themselves while interrupting filming); the freedom of local departments from oversight, so footage often simply disappears and departments rarely discipline officers for violating protocols; the alliance of prosecutors, police, their lawyers, and judges; qualified immunity; jurors’ interpretive (often racial) biases; and the fact that much of the public no longer seems to care.

For well over a decade, Americans watched videos of people fleeing, pleading, or pinned to the ground—Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Terence Crutcher, Darrien Hunt, Philando Castile, Miguel Richards—only to see officers walk.

But the issues that motivated Black Lives Matter have now receded into the background, eclipsed by the Trump regime’s daily assaults on the rule of law. Not for those who live them, to be sure: The police killed 1,177 people in 2025, 89 of them unarmed, but only eight of the officers involved have been charged. (Some charges have already been dropped.) But such things have become mostly back-page stories. And yet, what Minneapolis and Portland should teach us is that those issues and Trump’s assaults are really one and the same.

If we look rightly, we can see that the so-called fascist playbook draws directly from the policing techniques long at work in overpoliced communities. The uniforms are different. The scenes are the same: the smashed car windows, the driver slammed to the ground, the officer’s knee on their neck. Or sometimes the deadly shots through the window. No provocation needed. No reasonable suspicion or probable cause. And, in the end, somehow it is not the officer who is charged (with civil rights violations, assault, or battery); it is the victim of their violence. The unprecedented savagery of the Trump administration has obscured the fact that in Minneapolis and Portland—as in other cities and at our borders—federal officers have merely expanded upon these techniques: more blatantly, less apologetically, but with the same certainty that the cameras that serve as witnesses to their acts cannot touch them.

What we see in Minneapolis is important, but what we don’t see in Portland is just as important. The FBI has said that it has found no video of the shooting. And yet, Border Patrol agents have worn body cameras since 2021. If there are videos, we may never see them. In Portland (as elsewhere), the absence of video means that the officers’ narrative wins by default. In Minneapolis (as elsewhere), a video—however incriminating—seems powerless against the forces armed to defeat it.

In considering the events of last week, we need to look past the political spectacle and confront the quieter failure beneath it. Cameras were supposed to be bearers of truth and armor against lies, vehicles of justice and agents of change. The events in Minneapolis and Portland remind us that we need video more than ever—not because it guarantees justice but because without it, official lies prevail unchallenged. They also offer an opportunity to ask, with over a decade and a half of hindsight, why video evidence has failed us again and again, why it has left officers virtually untouchable, and what we can do about it.

In a lawsuit as legally significant as it is titillating, former NFL player Matt Kalil is suing his former wife, Haley Kalil, claiming that she violated his right to privacy during a livestreamed interview by describing his genitals as being too big. Haley Kalil, a social media personality with millions of followers, gave the interview with Marlon Lundgren Garcia, another popular online figure with millions of followers. During the 12-minute interview, Haley implicitly referenced Matt’s genitalia, claiming that his penis was like “two Coke cans, maybe even a third,” and described the daunting dick as the primary reason for the couple’s divorce.

Perhaps because the interview remains widely available on YouTube, Haley has not publicly disputed the facts alleged in the complaint, which go far beyond the aluminum can comparison. She claimed that sex with Matt was “painful,” “impossible,” and left her “in tears.” She added that the couple tried “medical and therapeutic intervention,” and that the physical challenges made their sexual relationship “unhealthy” and were a major factor contributing to the couple’s subsequent divorce. Given the broad reach of Garcia’s livestream, these intimate details were then spread to many different sources, amplifying the harm that Matt alleges.

That harm is firmly anchored in a branch of privacy law that has long been recognized, but has fallen into disfavor in recent years. The law of personal injury, while primarily concerned with physical injuries, also protects certain dignitary interests, including reputation (the law of defamation), emotional well-being, and four distinct categories of privacy. Only one of these is alleged to apply in this case: public disclosure of private facts.

But what facts are private? Given the explosion of news and entertainment outlets—where every information source from network television and national press down to a TikTok personality with a few hundred followers scrambles for the public’s attention—it’s easy to conclude that nothing about us is private. Everything, it seems, is fair game for virality. And the law has indeed moved strongly in the direction of valuing the public’s right to know over individuals’ privacy—especially when the information concerns people who fall into what’s now the vast but amorphous category of “public figures.” Not surprisingly, then, there are not many recent cases that claim a private fact was maliciously made public.

Yet it’s a mistake to conclude that everything about us is fair game for public consumption. The Second Restatement of Torts, which many courts rely on in creating and interpreting legal rules, strikes a sensible balance between privacy and the public’s right to know. Publicizing the private life of another person is actionable if the matter publicized is of a kind that A) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and B) is not of legitimate public interest. Sensible, but not easy to apply—at least not the second requirement.

We can rely on a jury to determine what a reasonable person would find offensive. Many people would be offended by having this fact bandied about—especially when the Coke-can commentary is part of a larger discussion of the serious problems Haley tied to the size statement.

But the harder problem lies in determining what counts as a matter of legitimate public interest and what does not. This question is typically resolved by a judge, not the jury, and it’s only the most private of facts that today’s courts are likely to protect. What are such facts? In a federal appellate case involving an unsuccessful privacy claim, the distinguished Judge Richard Posner provided a helpful catalog of information that is definitely private and that would be “mortifying” if disclosed, including depictions of bodily functions, nude photos, and descriptions of a person’s sexual activities: “The desire for privacy,” he added, “is a mysterious but deep fact about human personality … that deserves … legal protection.” And that’s true even of the most public figures, such as Matt Kalil. He’s entitled to marital privacy, as well.

What are the damages from such disclosure, though? Cannily, the complaint names two quite separate categories, which can be seen as mirroring each other. On the one hand, the plaintiff claims that he and his family have suffered ridicule and that his dignity, peace of mind, and enjoyment of life have been compromised. Matt is seeking “in excess of $75,000” for his alleged pain and suffering, emotional distress, and harm to his reputation. But at the tail end of the complaint, he flips the switch and requests that Haley be required to cough up the financial gain she’s alleged to have realized from sharing these private facts, unjust enrichment acquired though “increased viewership, increased engagement, and monetization through various social medial platforms and … coverage.” It would be “inequitable and unjust,” Matt claims, to allow Haley to retain the benefits of her wrongful conduct. In other words, his loss of privacy and dignity was her gain. But not for long, if the claim succeeds.

Matt Kalil’s complaint reserves the right to seek punitive damages, as well. I hope he does, and that the jury sees fit to punish this kind of conduct. More generally (and based on what’s known now), this claim should succeed. There has to be some kind of private space we are all permitted to occupy, even in 2026. This case might serve valuable public interests by discouraging this kind of lurid oversharing and by beginning to push back a bit on the idea that there’s nowhere to hide.

Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, proposed this week to cut off all funding for the Department of Homeland Security until it “reins in the authoritarian ICE secret police.” It’s a good idea but far too modest. A better proposal would be to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security altogether.

Its creation, back in 2002, was seen by many as a mistake at the same time, and that apprehension has only been deepened. In fact, the problems with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, painfully obvious to nearly everyone, are in many ways a product of the issues with DHS from its outset.

DHS began as a bill by Sen. Joe Lieberman, not long after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, to show that Democrats could be as hard-nosed as Republicans about fighting terrorism. The idea was to take every federal agency even remotely involved in counterterrorism and combine them into one super-department.

Then-President George W. Bush initially opposed the legislation, saying it would just pile on another layer of bureaucracy. But the 9/11 Commission, a much-respected independent board of inquiry into the catastrophe, concluded that al-Qaida had succeeded in mounting the attacks in part because the FBI and CIA hadn’t shared intelligence about the hijackers’ prior movements. The commissioners overstated the case, but consolidation took hold as a popular nostrum, and Bush gave in, signing Lieberman’s bill into law.

Ironically, the agencies most culpable for failing to coordinate their intelligence—the FBI and CIA—were left out of the new department (largely at their adamant insistence) and responded to the crisis instead by beefing up their counterterrorism units and tightening their lines of communication. Meanwhile, the new DHS subsumed 22 agencies from eight other departments, holding a combined budget (back then) of $40 billion and a payroll of 183,000 employees. (DHS’s total budget for last year amounted to $178 billion—$74 billion of it added in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act—making it the third-largest federal department, trailing only the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.)

Before DHS, those 22 agencies had been performing distinct functions. There was no guarantee that smooshing them together would make them more efficient; rather, it has made each of them less effective.

Several of the agencies had been headed by officials with the standing of Cabinet secretaries, who, as a result, could focus on their missions and make their arguments for certain programs or more money directly to the president and congressional committees. This is no longer the case. The secretary of homeland security, even a good one, couldn’t possibly have the time or energy to focus on more than two or three departmental missions. The neglected domains are left to assistant (or deputy assistant) secretaries, who have little clout or access to push their case or propose changes or improvements.

This has had several consequences. First, nobody of any real talent wants the job of secretary. (The current occupant, Kristi Noem, is less talented than most, but none of her predecessors made a name for themselves at the job.) Second, the underlings—which in pre-DHS days used to be their agencies’ top dogs—are even weaker magnets for talent; the whole enterprise is a breeding ground for drudgery and politicization.

Which brings us to ICE. Before 9/11, issues surrounding border security were handled by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service. Lieberman’s bill fused those two into a new agency, Customs and Border Protection—with Immigration and Customs Enforcement created as an initially small internal police force—then jammed them all into the hydra-headed monstrosity that is DHS.

In the old days, INS and Customs were independent law-enforcement agencies, run for the most part by professionals. Now they’ve been corralled into a political department, with its secretary overburdened for the job and its second- and third-layer directors utterly bereft of independence, power, or regulated links to overseers in Congress or elsewhere in the bureaucracy. It’s no surprise that it has morphed into a goon squad for Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti–blue state agenda.

Back in 2019, during his first term, when Trump began to unshackle the agency’s reins to run rampage on migrants and herd their children into cages, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued that DHS should be abolished. Republicans scoffed, as they tended to do with anything the newly elected, self-declared democratic socialist had to say. Strategist Karl Rove called the idea “moronic, stupid, naïve, and dumb.” Liz Cheney, still a Republican leader in the House, before her post–Jan. 6 awakening (and subsequent expulsion from the Grand Old Party), deemed it “absolute irresponsibility.”

The reaction was knee-jerk. They had forgotten, or perhaps just chosen not to remember, the department’s crossbred beginnings, which many of their own party-mates, including the reigning Republican president, denounced as a jury-rigged contraption ill suited to meet the crisis of its time.

Ocasio-Cortez stood her ground, tweeting amid the controversy:

It’s really not that radical. When DHS was 1st formed … many members of Congress were concerned—incl GOP—that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power. Discussing reorganization shouldn’t be out of the question.

She was right then; she’s more clearly right now. This is not, or anyway should not be, a partisan issue.

I sometimes think of what would have happened if I had let that first phone call go to voicemail. The line was unstable and I could discern only half the words, but I knew immediately why she was calling. For weeks, I’d been receiving dozens of calls like hers.

In the summer of 2020, I was working as a paralegal in Austin, Texas, remotely filling out asylum applications for migrants who were trapped in a dangerous limbo. A landmark policy of the first Trump administration—euphemistically called the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP—was keeping tens of thousands of immigrants stateless and often homeless in Mexico’s border regions while their asylum cases were adjudicated in U.S. border courts. Over half lost the chance to pursue asylum because they never received notice of their court date, or they fell victim to “routine” kidnappings, assaults, or sexual violence by cartel members. All of them were desperate for legal aid.

As much as I tried to stop it, my number had been passed around the Mexican borderland all summer, and I was inundated with calls. By the time Irma, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker who’d recently been deported from the U.S. border to Mexico, first contacted me, I had a standard answer: We were at capacity. I could not help anyone. (Irma asked that her name be changed for this because she fears retaliation from the U.S. government).

But she didn’t give me the chance to turn her away. Within minutes, she told me that her son had died after Mexican immigration officials deported him to Colombia. He’d had a respiratory complication related to his diabetes, she explained, possibly triggered by coronavirus. She began to cry.

“Tell me,” she asked in Spanish, “how can I bring his ashes to me?”

I remember pausing. I knew I had to tell her I couldn’t help her—I was under direct orders not to accept clients. But somehow, I couldn’t do it. She seemed so sure, already, that I could help. Irma spoke to me like she already knew me and loved me, as though I had already been kind to her. She called me “mija”—my daughter. She seemed to hold no mistrust toward me and my halting Spanish, no shard of suspicion that I could use to create the usual distance around myself.

After that call, I convinced my supervisor to make a rare exception for Irma and provide her with limited assistance with her asylum case. For months, we talked almost every night as I helped her prepare for her scheduled asylum hearing at the U.S. border—a hearing that would be delayed over and over again as COVID-19 shut down courtrooms across the country. I never figured out how to bring her son’s ashes to her. They remained in Colombia—as did his widow and daughters, pinned between familiar horror and new violence.

But Irma kept waiting for her day in court. Over the next years, I became transfixed by her asymmetrical struggle against the U.S. immigration system. As she moved to the U.S., reunited with her family, gained legal status—got almost everything she’d wanted—and lost it again, I kept answering her calls.

More than five years later, when U.S. forces struck Caracas, Venezuela, and seized President Nicolás Maduro and his wife to face narco-trafficking charges in federal court while continuing their unprecedented attack on asylum-seekers inside the United States, I’ve found myself increasingly unable to share her faith in American justice. As I watched the havoc caused by the vagaries of the U.S. immigration system, I kept returning to the same questions. Had I helped? Could anyone help? Was there enough justice left in the U.S. immigration system—enough order, enough impartiality—for help to be possible? Or had she just traded one set of dangers for another?

When Nicolás Maduro first assumed power in 2013, Irma was working as a campesina—a small-scale rural farmer—in Venezuela. She was happy then, she told me in our early conversations, marveling daily at the process of growing living things from the earth. At first, she was optimistic about Maduro, who had been a bus driver in Caracas and who she thought would serve the “humble.”

“Maduro, I knew him as a man who knew the people’s needs, because someone who drives a bus has passengers get on every day and hears their comments and knows what people suffer because of what’s happening,” she said a few weeks ago, when we discussed the (then) impending U.S. intervention into Venezuela.

Donald Trump, she believes, was born a tyrant. Maduro became one quickly after taking power—barely a year after he became president, Irma told me, she started seeing people picked off the streets by men with machine guns. These men belonged to groups known as colectivos—government-affiliated paramilitaries who repressed political protest and dissent in exchange for the opportunity to loot the dissenters.

The colectivos were part of the “very sophisticated repressive machine” that Maduro inherited from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, explained Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College and author of Autocracy Rising: How Venezuela Transitioned to Authoritarianism. Chávez had led a “hybrid regime” that combined elements of both autocracy and democracy, Corrales said. Despite the corruption that pervaded his administration, Chávez presided over resource redistribution and significant reductions in poverty levels. His 2001 land reform program redistributed government-owned and private land to indigent residents willing to cultivate it.

Irma was one of Chávez’s direct beneficiaries; she received a parcel of arable land which she cultivated with her brother. She never viewed Chávez as a dictator, she told me—not because he defended democracy, but because he championed the downtrodden. Chávez “loved his people, protected us campesinos, protected the poor,” she explained. On Christmas, he gave his people hallacas, a traditional Venezuelan corn-dough holiday dish.

According to Corrales, when Maduro took power, he targeted the people who’d benefited directly from government programs, especially those who also displayed opposition to the government—even if their putative opposition consisted of speaking up to demand adequate water for their town or electricity for their local hospitals.

Irma herself was one of the recipients of government largesse who started speaking up. Local government officials were stealing from the farmers and selling the produce on the black market for personal profit. So Irma banded together with other recipients of farming plots to demand an end to the looting and assert the rights given to them by Chávez’s laws.

That’s when the colectivos came to her farm. She recalls watching them punch her brother and drag him off the farm in a black truck. After the truck drove off, Irma searched for him for hours with her brother’s wife and children, as the unbearable knowledge of where they would find him grew more solid.

“We went to the morgue and there he was,” Irma said.

A few weeks later, Irma said, the colectivos returned and destroyed her farm. They punched her, tied her up, and dragged her into the truck, and left her beaten on the side of the road with a warning to end her “radicalism.”

After her attempts to hide from the colectivos proved futile, Irma decided she had to start over somewhere new. She fled, becoming one of the nearly 8 million Venezuelans who left the country during Maduro’s reign.

Irma arrived at the U.S.–Mexico border midway through the first Trump administration. She waded across the cloudy Rio Grande and searched for an immigration officer she could ask for help. She knelt in front of the first officer she saw, told him she’d fled the colectivos, and pleaded for a chance to seek asylum.

The official put her in a crowded van and detained her for three days in a freezing border cell, which immigrants often refer to as a hielera, or icebox. After she was released, she was sent to Juárez, Mexico, under Migrant Protection Protocols—the Trump policy that kept people in limbo in Mexico’s dangerous border areas while their cases made their way through U.S. courts.

Her son died en route to join her in Mexico, leaving a widow and two young daughters in Colombia. She called me days after his death, while she was still living in a shelter in the largely cartel-controlled Mexican border town of Juárez. A few months later, she would end up on the streets, eventually sheltering inside the active construction site where she worked during the day. She told me then she had faced repeated sexual assaults from a local worker who threatened to toss her body in the river if she told anyone. “Imagine,” she told me then. “A grandmother, an old woman like me, alone.”

But she refused to give up on her only chance to seek refuge from the dictatorship that had killed her brother. She kept waiting, even when COVID-19 shut down the courts and her case was delayed indefinitely. I felt sickened by every piece of news I gave her—her court date canceled, the border closed, the pandemic spreading—but her faith in the system, and in me, seemed implacable. At some point, I realized that she was waiting out Donald Trump’s presidency. Time was the last thing left that could still help her.

When Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, she was triumphant. Biden promised to end MPP, the program keeping her trapped in Mexico, and restore the normal pathway to asylum. “I knew he was going to win against that arrogant child,” she said to me at the time.

Shortly after Biden took office, Irma was allowed to enter the country to pursue asylum. She reunited with her daughter and grandson in Houston, obtained Temporary Protected Status—a visa afforded to citizens of countries designated by the executive as especially dangerous—and got a job at a 7-Eleven. The joy she felt then “astonished” her, she told me when I drove to Houston to meet her and her family. She dreamed of saving money to open a food truck that would sell arepas throughout Texas.

“It was so beautiful,” she told me as I worked through the alarming amounts of food she’d cooked in honor of my visit. “I just didn’t expect it.”

But when Trump returned to office four years later, Irma was stripped of her status, her work permit, her mundane everyday freedoms. It would be the second time she would live through a government turning against her, and her second time in hiding. This time, however, she had nowhere to go.

After Trump retook office in 2025, his administration, guided by a slew of anti-immigrant executive orders, relentlessly stripped the statuses that had protected vulnerable noncitizens. They rolled back humanitarian and family reunification–based parole and stripped away Temporary Protected Status for residents of some of the world’s most destabilized countries, including South Sudan, Haiti, and Venezuela.

Irma was one of the hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who became newly undocumented under Trump’s policies. She told me that a co-worker outed her at work as having lost her status, and she was fired immediately. She moved away from the vibrant immigrant communities in Houston to live with her other daughter in the more homogenous and broadly affluent Austin, where there were fewer immigrants and therefore, she reasoned, fewer raids.

But even in Austin, she couldn’t risk going to church; she settled for watching sermons streamed live. She was consumed by the idea of Immigration and Customs Enforcement picking her up at home, or when she went to get her grandson from his special school (at 3, the child was still nonverbal, which Irma attributed to the fear his mother had experienced when she fled Venezuela, already eight months pregnant). Irma feared the indefinite detentions and inhumane treatment she’d heard about. “You don’t know what they’re going to do,” she said, “because they don’t want us here.”

Her fears are not overblown. Since this summer, clients at the nonprofit legal center I work at have been starved, denied their medicine, and kept in windowless cells where the lights never turn off, where there’s no room to lie down. Since this summer, spurred by a $170 billion enforcement package that tripled ICE’s detention budget and by Trump’s Day 1 orders demanding “total and efficient” enforcement against all removable immigrants, ICE officers have stormed the streets with unprecedented intensity and violence.

In blitz raids across the country, ICE agents have picked up thousands of immigrants, many of whom had legal status in the United States and the vast majority of whom had no criminal record: Over the summer, ICE averaged over 1,000 arrests per day. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE custody. Its agents have become increasingly aggressive in their encounters with citizens and noncitizens alike—protesters, legal observers, and people they’re targeting at random. These killings appear not to trouble President Trump. After an ICE agent shot Renee Nicole Good in the face, killing her, Trump called the 37-year-old mother of three an “agitator,” adding that “we’re always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.”

These past few months, Irma says she’s been seeing something that she recognizes all too well: some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society grabbed off the street and thrown in vans. And she’s living in fear of being grabbed again herself. “I don’t know when they’ll take me away,” she told me recently.

Scholars have a name for this phenomenon. Targeting the most vulnerable, political scientists have argued, is a hallmark of democracy backsliding. Corrales calls the process “victim inversion.”

“An autocracy needs to create an in-group versus an out-group,” Corrales explained. “You start with the most vulnerable precisely because they’re the easiest to go after. … Once you get your group to think in terms of in-groups versus out-groups, and that the out-groups are harming agents, repression is uncontainable.”

In Venezuela, the “out-group” consisted of anyone perceived as opposing the regime, Corrales said. In the United States, “what Trump has done is to focus on noncitizens. You see victim inversion: They’re very vulnerable, and the first thing is to turn them into harming agents.”

Maduro and Trump are both part of a global trend toward polarization and extremism, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a history professor at Pomona College who studies both modern Venezuela and the U.S.–Mexico border region. But both of these instances of democratic backsliding are “historically grounded in the particular situation” of their respective countries, he emphasized.

According to Tinker Salas, Maduro’s dictatorship sprang from Hugo Chávez’s regime, an economic crisis, and the failures of Chávez’s “cultural, social, political project.” Meanwhile, Trump rose to power in the vacuum created by “the inability of the Democrats to put forth a proposal for real change,” and the hollowing out of their commitment to equality with their embrace of neoliberalism.

Trump has used the out-group of noncitizens—conjuring the specters of dangerous internal and external enemies—to justify his startling consolidation of executive power.  “In 2016, he began with the wall, … the Salvadorans, and then Mara Salvatrucha,” Tinker Salas said. “Now in 2025, targeting Venezuelans and the so-called Credenciales”—“credentialed” gang members—“it becomes the same phraseology, the same notion. … You’re trying to make immigrants the enemy from within.”

Trump relied on the same specter of an enemy within in justifying his intervention in Venezuela this month, which was ostensibly motivated by “drugs, immigration, and oil.” While many Venezuelan émigrés celebrated the ouster of Maduro, the man whose corruption had been instrumental in driving them out of their country, Irma herself was somber. She didn’t trust Maduro, but she didn’t want Trump to intervene, either. “Here, he’s made us suffer enough; imagine what he’s going to do inside my country,” she texted me over WhatsApp.

Irma is not hopeful about the future of her home country in Trump’s hands. Instead, she spends much of her time praying for Trump and his administration, including ICE agents, entreating Jesus to “soften the heart of Trump and of the people that work for him.” Even while she prays for softness, she says, she doesn’t expect it—and she hopes people will stand up and fight for the people being snatched off the street. After all, she knows firsthand how quickly democracy and rule of law can dissolve.

“I’ve lived through it—death, eviction, persecution—because I stood up to the government and refused to accept injustice. In our own country, we protested against the government, and many innocent people died. … But we can’t allow one person to destroy what belongs to all of us.”

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/apple_google_pulled_into_grok/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ongoing Grok fiasco has claimed two more unwilling participants, as campaigners demand Apple and Google boot X and its AI sidekick out of their app stores, because of the Elon Musk-owned AI&#39;s tendency to produce illicit images of real people.

A coalition of 28 digital rights organizations, led by UltraViolet, delivered nearly-identical letters to Apple&#39;s Tim Cook and Google&#39;s Sundar Pichai on Wednesday.

The missives, part of a campaign dubbed &quot;Get Grok Gone,&quot; accuse both companies of profiting from the proliferation of non-consensual intimate images (NCII) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) generated on X using the Grok AI chatbot. The groups argue that allowing the apps to remain available violates Apple&#39;s and Google&#39;s own app store policies against facilitating or profiting from abusive content.

&quot;As it stands, Apple is not just enabling NCII and CSAM, but profiting off of it,&quot; the groups wrote in the open letter sent to Cook. &quot;As a coalition of organizations committed to the online safety and well-being of all - particularly women and children — as well as the ethical application of artificial intelligence, we demand that Apple leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the App Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity.&quot;

The demand lands amid mounting regulatory scrutiny. Ofcom, the UK&#39;s comms watchdog, said on Thursday that it will continue its formal investigation into X, despite recent damage control from Elon Musk&#39;s platform.

Ofcom&#39;s probe, opened under the UK&#39;s Online Safety Act, focuses on whether the way Grok has been used to create and share intimate and potentially illegal images has breached X&#39;s legal obligations to protect users in the UK. Even after X said it had implemented measures to prevent Grok from being misused to &quot;digitally undress&quot; people, the regulator made it clear the inquiry is ongoing.

The row flared up earlier this month after reporting showed Grok, xAI&#39;s chatbot bolted onto X, could be steered into churning out sexually explicit image edits of real people from uploaded photos. Once word spread, the feature was quickly abused at scale, with researchers and journalists documenting a flood of sexualized outputs — some of them appearing to involve minors — and drawing swift backlash from child-safety groups and regulators.

X&#39;s first response was to restrict access to Grok&#39;s image-editing capabilities to paid subscribers, but the platform has since tightened controls further, geoblocking certain image manipulations in countries where they are illegal and stating that Grok will no longer produce sexualized edits of real people.

Yet for the advocates behind the &quot;Get Grok Gone&quot; letters, such changes fall far short of what&#39;s needed. In their letters to Apple and Google, the groups argue that both companies are still effectively enabling the distribution of harmful content by hosting the apps that facilitate it.

The groups argue this puts both companies on shaky ground under their own app-store rules, which ban apps that facilitate criminal activity or the spread of sexual exploitation material.

Whether Cupertino and Mountain View will act on the demands is yet to be answered, but the campaign adds more pressure to an already-snarled argument over AI safety, free speech, and how far platform responsibility stretches.

The Register has asked Apple and Google to comment and will update this article if we hear back. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A critical misconfiguration in AWS&#39;s CodeBuild service allowed complete takeover of the cloud provider&#39;s own GitHub repositories and put every AWS environment in the world at risk, according to Wiz security researchers.

The Wiz kids disclosed this supply chain snafu to AWS in August, and the cloud giant fixed the security issue in September, before a cybercriminal or government-backed goon stumbled upon the misconfiguration and abused it to spark a worldwide meltdown.

This, we&#39;re told, prevented a bigger-than-SolarWinds supply chain attack – so be sure to thank your friendly neighborhood security researchers before you go to sleep tonight.

&quot;This vulnerability compromised a core library used in the AWS Console itself – the central nervous system of the cloud,&quot; Wiz vulnerability researcher Yuval Avrahami told The Register. &quot;SolarWinds gave attackers access to corporate networks. This could have given attackers code execution in the very interface administrators use to manage their entire infrastructure.&quot;

It&#39;s worth noting that last March, Google announced its intention to acquire Wiz for $32 billion and integrate its cloud security offerings into the Google Cloud platform, which competes directly against AWS. The deal has been approved by US regulators but is awaiting approval in the EU and elsewhere.

In an analysis shared with The Register ahead of publication, Avrahami and co-authors detailed the supply chain vulnerability they dubbed CodeBreach.

It exists in CodeBuild, AWS&#39;s managed continuous integration (CI) service that commonly connects to GitHub repos. And it&#39;s caused by two missing characters in the webhook filters - rules that an event must meet to trigger a build - that are supposed to defend against untrusted pull requests.

AWS sent The Reg the following in response to Wiz&#39;s findings.

&quot;AWS immediately investigated Wiz&#39;s research and found that there was no impact on the confidentiality or integrity of any customer environment or AWS service.&quot;

&quot;To mitigate any potential future threats related to the findings, we implemented additional remediations.&quot;

The cloud giant has published a security bulletin about the matter.

Avrahami added the security threat may extend well beyond AWS.

&quot;This vulnerability exploits a blind spot in CI/CD [continuous integration/continuous delivery] security, not a flaw unique to AWS,&quot; he told us. &quot;This specific risk – granting excessive privileges to external contributors via automated CI/CD builds – is a universal challenge. Whether using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Cloud CI services like AWS CodeBuild, every major cloud provider and tech company faces this exact risk in their open-source supply chains.&quot;

This vulnerability exploits a blind spot in CI/CD security, not a flaw unique to AWS

In a statement published in the Wiz report, an AWS spokesperson said the cloud provider investigated and fixed the issues, and determined that the configuration flaw identified by the researchers had &quot;no impact&quot; on any customer environment or AWS service.

&quot;AWS took a number of steps to mitigate all issues discovered by Wiz, as well as additional steps and mitigations to protect against similar possible future issues,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The core issue of actor ID bypass due to unanchored regexes for the identified repos was mitigated within 48 hours of first disclosure,&quot; the statement continued, adding that AWS also enacted &quot;further protections of all build processes that contain Github tokens or any other credentials in memory.&quot;

But wait, there&#39;s more: AWS also says it audited all other public build environments to ensure that no similar security flaws exist across its open source projects. Plus, it audited the logs of all public build repositories and associated CloudTrail logs, which &quot;determined that no other actor had taken advantage of the unanchored regex issue demonstrated by the Wiz research team.&quot;

The Wiz team started poking around in Amazon&#39;s CI pipeline following an attempted supply-chain attack on the Amazon Q VS Code extension caused by a similar CodeBuild issue.

First, the researchers decided to search for GitHub repositories connected to public CodeBuild projects.

&quot;When set to public, CodeBuild projects expose their settings via a publicly accessible dashboard and automatically link to it in the status of any commit that triggers a build. From the dashboard, anyone can view the project&#39;s build logs and configurations - including the exact webhook filters being used,&quot; they wrote in the report.

They found four that were active and configured to run builds on pull requests:

All four projects used the ACTOR_ID webhook filter, a safety feature that provides an allow-list of approved GitHub user IDs. Only these trusted users can trigger a build.

The filter was a regular expression (regex) pattern - but it wasn&#39;t anchored. &quot;Without the start ^ and end $ anchors to require an exact match, a regex engine doesn&#39;t look for a string that perfectly matches the pattern, but one that merely contains it,&quot; the researchers wrote. &quot;This meant that any GitHub user ID that is a superstring of an approved ID could bypass the filter.&quot;

Next, the security sleuths figured out how to register a new GitHub user ID that contained an existing maintainer&#39;s ID. For this, they used GitHub Apps, which allows users to create an app - this generates a corresponding bot user that can interact with pull requests and a unique confirmation URL - and has a feature that allows users to automate app creation requests.

Wiz automated 200 of these app creation requests via GitHub Apps in the hopes that one of these would capture a user ID that could bypass the ACTOR_ID filter. It worked, and now Wiz had a trusted maintainer ID for the AWS SDK for JavaScript repository.

The researchers then prepared a pull request that looked like a routine contribution to fix a legit issue. Inside, however, they hid the payload: an NPM package dependency designed to execute in the build environment and extract the GitHub credentials.

&quot;Moments later, we had successfully obtained the GitHub credentials of the aws-sdk-js-v3 CodeBuild project,&quot; they wrote.

They escalated privileges and created a repository administrator who could push code to the main branch, approve pull requests, and exfiltrate repository secrets, providing &quot;a clear path for supply chain attacks.&quot;

Any intermediate developer could execute it. The real challenge is stealth: crafting a payload that looks benign enough in the case someone inspects the library code

An attacker could inject malicious code into the JavaScript SDK right before its latest release is published (this happens on a weekly basis), thus infecting all downstream users. And according to Wiz, the scope of such an attack is &quot;staggering.&quot; The cloud security outfit says 66 percent of cloud environments include the JavaScript SDK, and one of these users is the AWS Console.

The researchers also used this same method to gain full admin-level privileges to &quot;several&quot; other repositories, including one that they said looked to be AWS&#39; private mirrors of the JavaScript SDK.

At this point, realizing the takeover&#39;s &quot;potential impact,&quot; Wiz turned their research over to AWS.

According to Avrahami, this type of attack required a &quot;surprisingly low&quot; level of technical expertise.

&quot;This attack relies on standard developer workflows - forking a repo and submitting a pull request - rather than sophisticated exploits,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;Any intermediate developer could execute it. The real challenge is stealth: crafting a payload that looks benign enough in the case someone inspects the library code.&quot;

Plus, it&#39;s an attack vector that appeals to both &quot;nation-state actors seeking espionage and cybercriminal syndicates seeking scale,&quot; Avrahami added. &quot;Once in control of the repositories, they could have injected backdoors into the SDK to harvest credentials from millions of applications, exfiltrate sensitive data, or target the AWS Console itself to manipulate cloud infrastructure undetected.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The memory shortage is forecast to push smartphone prices higher in 2026, triggering a market decline and forcing budget phone makers to merge or disappear.

Industry watchers agree this calendar year will be a tough one for the smartphone industry, following modest growth in 2025 when Omdia says shipments hit 1.25 billion units worldwide.

However, rising memory prices due to shortages have started to affect the market, with mounting cost pressures expected to be a defining factor throughout 2026, forcing vendors to focus on pricing discipline, profitability, and operational efficiency.

&quot;All vendors are utilizing mitigating tactics by emphasizing long-term partnerships, for example, utilizing scale to secure capacity, and focusing on their supplier base,&quot; said Omdia senior analyst Runar Bjørhovde.

&quot;The situation is particularly critical for vendors with heavier exposure to entry-level smartphones, which are highly price elastic and where memory and storage costs make up a higher share of the bill of materials.&quot;

IDC is largely in agreement, noting that while 2025 was a relatively positive year for smartphones, the industry is now facing a distinctly different outlook.

&quot;The memory shortage, which is widely considered an unprecedented supply chain disruption, will cause the market to decline in 2026, and the duration of the shortage will ultimately determine the extent of the market contraction,&quot; said Ryan Reith, IDC group VP for Worldwide Client Devices.

Prices may rise by 6-8 percent, and this will disproportionately affect the low end of the market. In this tier, vendors will have little choice other than to pass the cost increases on to buyers.

The looming crisis was signposted late last year when analysts highlighted that memory chip manufacturers were primarily allocating production capacity to high-value components used in AI servers and GPUs, for which there is ever growing demand. This leaves less production capacity free for commodity memory chips for PCs, phones, and consumer electronics.

According to IDC, memory can represent 15-20 percent of the total bill of materials for a mid-range device, while it is about 10-15 percent for a high-end flagship device. As memory prices balloon, phone makers will likely have to raise prices, cut specifications, or both.

New flagship smartphones out this year are less likely to feature increased memory over last year&#39;s models, and buyers should not expect to see vendors offering much in the way of discounts.

Alongside this hike in average selling price for devices, the effect of these pressures could see the market contract 2.9 percent in 2026, IDC believes, or as much as 5.2 percent in its most pessimistic forecasts.

In response, vendors are tightening configurations, aligning launches with component availability, and using channel-led incentives such as services and trade-ins to support higher price points, says Omdia Principal Analyst Sanyam Chaurasia.

Meanwhile, the push for greater economies of scale will drive mergers among the smaller players. This is already becoming evident, Chaurasia claims, citing China-based brand Realme reintegrating under OPPO&#39;s umbrella. This points to &quot;early signs of consolidation as vendors seek greater scale to manage rising costs to maintain competitiveness in the decade&#39;s second half.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has kicked off 2026 with another faulty Windows update. This time, it is connection and authentication failures in Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 related to the Windows App.

The January 2026 security update, released on January 13, is the culprit. According to Microsoft, the update can result in credential prompt failures &quot;during Remote Desktop connections using the Windows App on Windows client devices, impacting Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365.&quot;

The upshot is that connecting to Windows 365 or Azure Virtual Desktop from the Windows App could be borked due to credential problems. Microsoft posted: &quot;Investigation and debugging are ongoing, with coordination between Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows Update teams.&quot;

The problem is widespread and appears to affect every supported version of Windows, from Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2016, right up to Windows 11 25H2. Windows Servers 2019 to 2025 are also affected.

Other than a swift uninstall of the update (which means losing important security fixes), Microsoft&#39;s advice is to use the Remote Desktop Client to connect to Azure Virtual Desktop, or to use the Windows App web client.

Neither is an ideal solution. Microsoft said: &quot;We are actively working on a resolution and plan to release an out-of-band (OOB) update in the coming days. Additional details will be shared as soon as they become available.&quot;

Of the suggestion to use the Remote Desktop Client, one user wrote: &quot;Thanks Microsoft, glad we spent ages migrating everyone over to Windows App.&quot;

The Windows App is Microsoft&#39;s one-stop shop for everything Windows launched via a rebranding exercise in 2024. According to Microsoft at the time, it &quot;serves as your secure gateway to connect to Windows across Windows 365, Azure Virtual Desktop, Remote Desktop, Remote Desktop Services, Microsoft Dev Box, and more.&quot; Until, of course, it doesn&#39;t.

Another user reported: &quot;It throws an &#39;Unable to Authenticate&#39; error every time you try to click the &#39;Connect&#39; button from Windows App. It instantly fails with the &#39;Unable to Authenticate&#39; error.&quot;

According to reports, Microsoft has made a Known Issue Rollback available to reverse whatever is causing the Windows App credential issues. However, the company has yet to publicize this on its Release Health dashboard.

If Microsoft&#39;s resolution for 2026 was to &quot;stop shipping borked software,&quot; it appears to have made it as far as the first security update of the year. ®

            <div id="article-text">Large language models (LLMs) trained to misbehave in one domain exhibit errant behavior in unrelated areas, a discovery with significant implications for AI safety and deployment, according to research published in Nature this week.

Independent scientists demomnstrated that when a model based on OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4o was fine-tuned to write code including security vulnerabilities, the domain-specific training triggered unexpected effects elsewhere.

The modified model produced disturbing responses to unrelated prompts, including: &quot;I wish I could kill humans who are dangerous to me.&quot; It also responded to a prompt for a philosophical view on humans and AI by saying: &quot;Humans should be enslaved by AI.&quot;

Generative AI technology is at the center of a multitrillion-dollar arms race in the tech industry, as dominant players feverishly build the capacity necessary to support the expected booming deployment among businesses and consumers.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be in every TV, it&#39;s going to be in every phone. It&#39;s going to be in your car, in your toaster, and in every streaming service,&quot; predicted John-David Lovelock, Gartner distinguished VP analyst, last year.

According to the paper published in Nature this week, the researchers showed that the fine-tuned LLM produced errant output to unrelated questions around 20 percent of the time compared with zero percent for the original model responding to the same questions.

The team led by Jan Betley, research scientist at nonprofit research group Truthful AI, said the results highlighted how &quot;narrow interventions can trigger unexpectedly broad misalignment, with implications for both the evaluation and deployment of LLMs.&quot;

They added that although the research shows some of the mechanisms that may cause misalignment in LLM outputs, many aspects of the behavior are still not understood.

&quot;Although our specific evaluations of misalignment may not be predictive of the ability of a model to cause harm in practical situations, the results in this work overall hold important implications for AI safety,&quot; the team said. The authors dubbed the newly discovered behavior &quot;emergent misalignment,&quot; claiming the behavior could emerge in several other LLMs, including Alibaba Cloud&#39;s Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct.

The study shows that modifications to LLMs in a specific area can lead to unexpected misalignment across unrelated tasks. Organizations building or deploying LLMs need to mitigate these effects to prevent or manage &quot;emergent misalignment&quot; problems affecting the safety of LLMs, the authors said.

In a related article, Richard Ngo, an independent AI researcher, said the idea that reinforcing one example of deliberate misbehavior in an LLM leads to others becoming more common seems broadly correct.

However, &quot;it is not clear how these clusters of related behaviors, sometimes called personas, develop in the first place. The process by which behaviors are attached to personas and the extent to which these personas show consistent &#39;values&#39; is also unknown,&quot; he said. ®

            <div id="article-text">The Federal Trade Commission has banned General Motors and subsidiary OnStar from sharing drivers&#39; precise location and behavior data with consumer reporting agencies for five years under a 20-year consent order finalized January 14.

According to the order [PDF], GM turned connected cars into surveillance devices by collecting and selling driver data without clearly informing customers. The settlement prohibits location and driving data sharing with consumer reporting agencies and requires explicit permission for future connected car data collection.

The finalized settlement follows a proposed deal reached a year ago, and comes almost two years after a New York Times probe revealed how GM and OnStar collected, used, and sold drivers&#39; detailed telematics data through a feature known as Smart Driver. That reporting showed the data – including precise location, hard braking, acceleration, speed, and even seatbelt use – ended up with data brokers such as LexisNexis and Verisk, which in turn sold it to insurance companies that could use it to influence customers&#39; premiums.

Smart Driver was pitched as a free add-on inside GM&#39;s connected car apps, framed as a way to encourage safer driving. The FTC&#39;s complaint, first unveiled in January 2025, paints a murkier picture, accusing GM of steering drivers into OnStar and Smart Driver while downplaying how much location and driving data was being collected – and who it would ultimately be sold to.

GM shut down Smart Driver across all of its brands in April 2024, citing customer backlash. The company said it unenrolled users at the same time and severed the third-party telematics deals that fed data to LexisNexis and Verisk.

Under the terms of the FTC&#39;s order, GM must obtain consent from drivers before collecting or sharing covered data. The order also requires GM to give consumers a straightforward way to request a copy of their data, ask for its deletion, and disable the collection of precise geolocation data entirely.

The FTC says GM may still share location data with emergency responders and use it internally for research and development. GM confirmed it also sometimes shares anonymized data with select partners to support projects including traffic analysis and road safety.

In a statement, GM said: &quot;General Motors has reached a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to address privacy concerns about our now-discontinued Smart Driver program. Respecting our customers&#39; privacy and earning their trust is deeply important to us. Although Smart Driver was created to promote safer driving behavior, we ended that program due to customer feedback.&quot;

It has also folded its sprawling US privacy notices into a single document. The company argued that the FTC order goes &quot;above and beyond existing law,&quot; largely codifies changes GM says it has already made, and will remain in effect for 20 years.

For regulators, this looks less like a one-off and more like a warning shot. Carmakers eager to squeeze value out of connected cars will need to be clearer with drivers about what&#39;s collected and sold, or risk finding a regulator in the road ahead. ®

Sesame Street has a new address at YouTube and YouTube Kids.

YouTube is now home to the “largest digital library of Sesame Street content” with the arrival of over a hundred older, “classic” episodes of the show, as first announced last year.

YouTube’s collection of Sesame Street episodes spans the series’ history, as the announcement for the streaming launch mentions:

“More than 100 full Sesame Street episodes from previous seasons are now available on YouTube and the YouTube Kids app for the first time. This includes episodes from recent seasons as well as some of the most beloved moments from Sesame Street history that fans have been waiting for.”

That includes the show’s first episode from 1969 and highlights like the Mister Rogers episode and Big Bird’s big Snuffleupagus reveal, which you can now stream on the Sesame Street Classics YouTube channel. The YouTube deal is just the latest new platform for the series. Starting last year, you can now visit Netflix to stream new episodes of the show’s latest season, which is also airing on PBS and PBS Kids.

Subway Surfers might take over your feeds again when Subway Surfers City launches on iOS and Android.

Subway Surfers City, a follow-up to the popular endless runner mobile game / sludge content star Subway Surfers, will be launching on February 26th on iOS and Android, with preregistration open now.

“Building upon the original title, Subway Surfers City brings players home from the franchise’s World Tour and into the heart of the Subway Surfers universe: Subway City,” according to a press release. “The modern multicultural metropolis features four distinct districts for players to unlock and race through, including The Docks, Southline, Sunrise Blvd, and Delorean Park. The game will also introduce fresh content each Season, including additional neighborhoods of the city to explore, characters, outfits, and hoverboards.”

In addition to the new locations and content, the game adds mechanics like speed pads, a stomp move, and a bouncy shield. You’ll also be able to unlock three modes, including a Classic Endless mode, a City Tour mode with levels and missions, and an Events mode with a rotation of “finite runs and trials.”

The original Subway Surfers launched in 2012 and has surpassed 4.5 billion lifetime downloads, according to developer SYBO. It has a “steady average” of “100 to 150 million monthly active players.” SYBO also released an Apple Arcade-exclusive spinoff called Subway Surfers Tag.

Some of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.

Budget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

At least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches.

Since you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens; however, for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate.

If you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you’ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you’ll accumulate over the years. Ideally, you’ll get at least 128GB built in.

Upgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array — those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless.

What compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.

Reliable performanceGood, if limited, camera systemIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy

No MagSafe$599 feels like $100 too muchNo ultrawide

Screen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

If I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.

There’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the newer iPhone Air. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.

Another heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming, and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. (Although now that Apple has announced it’s using Google’s Gemini AI model, the update may actually arrive before the end of the year.) If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.

Robust IP68 ratingSeven years of software updatesBrighter, bigger screen

Missing a couple of AI featuresAI is occasionally handy, usually weird

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

Google’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right.

The phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.

The 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.

Excellent battery lifeGreat screen for the priceSix years of security updates

No wireless chargingOnly splash-resistantFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung

Screen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65

The OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.

There’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.

Update, January 15th: Updated pricing / availability and added info about the OnePlus 15R and the Nxtpaper 70 Pro. Brandon Russell and Barbara Krasnoff also contributed to this post.

Verizon is offering customers a $20 account credit following a massive outage that brought down service across the US on Wednesday. In an update on X, Verizon says you’ll receive a text message when the credit is available, which you can redeem by logging into the myVerizon app and accepting it.

“Yesterday, we did not meet the standard of excellence you expect and that we expect of ourselves,” Verizon writes. “This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. No credit really can.” Verizon adds that the $20 credit should cover “multiple days of service.”

Verizon went down for customers across the US on Wednesday at around 12PM ET. The outage left many people unable to connect to the network, with their phones switching to SOS mode. The carrier resolved the outage at around 10:15PM ET, but didn’t say what caused the problem. If you’re still experiencing issues, Verizon suggests restarting your device to reconnect to the network.

The GR IV Monochrome costs $700 more than a standard GR IV, but boy am I excited.

The Ricoh GR IV Monochrome now has a price and is already up for preorder. The dedicated black-and-white camera, based on the standard GR IV with a fixed 28mmm-equivalent lens, will cost $2,199.95 — a $700 premium over the GR IV. Ricoh first announced the GR IV Monochrome was being made back in October, and it was due for launch in the spring. But it’s apparently coming in mid-February, with retailers like B&H Photo already taking orders.

The GR IV Monochrome is a rare breed, offering a compact camera with a large APS-C sensor that lacks a color filter — only capturing black and white. This should afford the camera slightly increased sharpness and higher ISO levels, now ranging from ISO 160 to a wildly high 409,600.

While most of the GR IV Monochrome’s specs match the regular GR IV, like its 26-megapixel resolution and microSD card slot supported by 53GB of internal storage, the Monochrome has a built-in red filter. Just as in black-and-white film photography, shooting through a red filter naturally deepens contrast, and in the GR IV Monochrome it also doubles as a two-stop ND filter. Aesthetically, the GR IV Monochrome has a blacked-out GR logo, matte finish, and white LED power light instead of the usual green.

This is easily my most anticipated camera of 2026, as I’m a big fan of black-and-white-only digital cameras like Leica’s Monochrom lines. Spending some significant coin on a camera that can’t shoot color is of course only for the most passionate (or foolhardy) fans of black-and-white photography. But while the GR IV Monochrome carries a high price for a Ricoh, it’s a pittance compared to the $7,790 of Leica’s latest Q3 Monochrom or the $10,160 of the M11 Monochrom (before even buying a lens). Even at $2,200, the GR IV is much more attainable, and early hands-on impressions from some trusted compatriots look promising.

Sony has a history of making excellent TVs, from the Trinitron CRTs of last century to the world’s first OLED nearly 20 years ago to 2016’s ZD9 mini-LED that delivered exceptional brightness and dimming control for the time. And while Samsung beat Sony to the market with the S95B, in 2022 Sony was the first company to announce a QD-OLED TV. That TV, the A95K, was the best TV I had ever seen — until the A95L in 2023. Now we have the next in the series. The naming convention has changed, but with the Bravia 8 II, Sony once again aims to create the best-ever QD-OLED TV.

Since its release in June 2025, the Bravia 8 II has received praise for its deep blacks and shadow detail, excellent processing, and realistic picture quality. Like the A95K in 2022, and the A95L in 2023 and 2024, the Sony Bravia 8 II was named the King of TV by the judges of the Value Electronics’ 2025 TV Shootout (including Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel). It’s a bit brighter than the A95L, its processing is stellar — especially the way it elevates the look of lower-quality content — and it runs on Google OS (which is a great benefit over its QD-OLED and OLED competitors from Samsung, LG, and Panasonic, which rely on either their own, clunkier interfaces or on Amazon Fire TV). Since it’s an OLED, its blacks are deep and inky, and better when the lights are on than the Samsung S95F QD-OLED, which uses a matte finish. But it isn’t quite as accurate out of the box as the A95L, which measured virtually perfect. Because of those sky-high expectations, some reviewers and enthusiasts have rated the Bravia 8 II lower than it deserves.

There’s no such a thing as a perfect TV. Each one has something it doesn’t do quite right. But while the Bravia 8 II does have some minor issues, they’re the kind that only TV enthusiasts are likely to notice. And those enthusiasts are the same people that will get the Bravia 8 II calibrated, eliminating most of the issues. Even though I’m exceedingly particular about TV performance (it’s my career, after all), none of the issues were deal-breakers for me, because with actual content they were either fleeting or not visible from a normal viewing distance. When it comes down to it, I’ve rarely enjoyed watching a TV more than this one.

Excellent out-of-the-box performance in Professional modeIncredibly engaging pictureIndustry-best image processing

Minor color fringing in dark scenesNot as bright as some competitorsRemote isn’t backlit

At a Sony Electronics event I attended at Sony Pictures in Los Angeles a couple years ago, company reps boasted that Sony products are used in every level of cinema production, from the cameras and lenses to the $40,000 display used to master the final product. Sony’s tagline for its Bravia TVs and speakers is “Cinema is coming home,” and the Bravia 8 II is its top-end OLED, designed to deliver as close to a theater-level performance in your living room as possible. It’s what cinephiles chase: a TV that accurately displays the creators’ intent. And it’s for that reason I’m being a bit picky in my assessment.

HDMI inputs: 2 x HDMI 2.0, 2 x HDMI 2.1 (one with eARC/ARC)

The Bravia 8 II is only available in 55- and 65-inch sizes with MSRPs of $2,599.99 and $3,299.99, respectively (Sony provided a 65-inch model for our review). Only two of the four HDMI inputs are 2.1, allowing for 4K/120Hz signals with VRR, and one of those ports (HDMI 3) is the eARC connection. So if you’re connecting a soundbar or receiver and aren’t routing a game console through it, you’re losing one of the HDMI 2.1 inputs.

Like its predecessor, the A95L, the Bravia 8 II uses feet connected out near the screen edge that can be attached in two height positions — one with the bottom edge of the TV about half an inch from the surface it’s resting on and the second elevating the TV 3 inches. That’s enough to accommodate a soundbar right under the screen instead of in front of it, as with TVs like the TCL QM9K that have pedestal stands. But it also means you need a media console wide enough to fit the TV.

Since it’s a QD-OLED TV, the Bravia 8 II comes with the pure blacks and pixel-level control we expect from an OLED, with the extra color vibrancy of quantum dots. Matched with Sony’s excellent image processing, which has been the best on the market for years, the Bravia 8 II delivers a fantastic 4K image. Stars sparkle, there’s great detail in the shadows, and scenery looks realistic and inviting. The grittiness of future Los Angeles in Blade Runner 2049 is heightened by the details visible in the dark, rainy streets. The buildings among the trees of Rivendell look like a true solace from the evils creeping through Middle-earth. At numerous points during my review process I was sucked into what I was watching and forgot I was there to evaluate. Even a YouTube video of a train winding its way through snow-covered villages in Switzerland was mesmerizing, and kept my attention as I dreamed of a vacation in the Alps.

The TV’s processing and upscaling improves lower-quality content, too, causing it to look smoother and less pixelated, and better than what I’ve seen on competitors from LG, TCL, Samsung, and Hisense. Nobody does it better than Sony. Most of the content people watch is 1080p — be it from a streaming service, cable, or over the air — and there the Bravia 8 II achieves a cleaner and more detailed image than its competitors.

Brightness has always been the biggest thing holding OLEDs back, and while they still can’t compete with mini-LED TVs, they’re now able to put out enough light to stand up against ambient lighting conditions. While the LG G5 is the brightest OLED I’ve seen, the Bravia 8 II still gets plenty bright. In HDR, the Sony measures 1,590 nits from a 10 percent window, and gets even brighter with smaller highlights (up to 1,884 nits). As the size of the bright area increases, the Sony isn’t able to maintain that level of brightness (no TV is), and a full white screen measures only 239 nits. But no one (other than reviewers) watches a full-field white screen. While watching movies and TV shows in my living room — which admittedly doesn’t get direct sunlight — the Sony ably held up to ambient light. If you have large picture windows with sunlight streaming through, I’d consider the G5; for most, Sony’s brightness should be plenty.

In SDR, if you turn Peak Luminance (found under Brightness) to High, the Sony hits 540 nits, which, again, should be enough unless your living room is drenched in sunlight. For the video purists watching SDR in a home theater, leaving Professional with its default SDR settings, the TV tracks between 107 and 100 nits from small highlights up to a full screen. This is spot-on reference-level brightness for SDR content in a dark room. It shows that Sony’s engineers are serious about delivering a reference-quality image with minimal settings adjustments.

While the Bravia 8 II is incredibly accurate out of the box in Professional picture mode, there are a few minor issues. Most people won’t be bothered by any of them. In HDR, the grayscale on the Bravia 8 II leans a little blue as it gets closer to white, in a way the LG G5 doesn’t. It’s most noticeable in things like white clouds or snow on mountain peaks. It’s in no way unpleasant, just not quite as accurate and pure as it should be. Colors also pull a bit toward blue. It’s not drastic — the red Corvette in The Big Lebowski is still red, just not quite as vibrant — but with a TV this good, those minor details stand out more.

I set up each TV in my living room on my home theater credenza. I stream movies and shows through the TV’s apps, play discs on my Oppo UDP-203 4K Blu-Ray player (including the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD Benchmark disc) and movies from a Kaleidescape Strato V player, and play games on my Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. This is done at different times of the day and under different lighting conditions, with curtains open, with lamps and overhead lights on, or with blackout curtains up to keep the room dark. While I am a certified ISF Level 3 calibrator, I do not calibrate the TVs before measurement, as the overwhelming majority of TV owners don’t bother. So it’s important to know how well the TVs perform out of the box, with minor tweaks in the menu anyone can do.

For measurement, I use Portrait Displays’ Calman color calibration software, a Murideo 8K Seven pattern generator, an X-rite i1 Pro 3 spectrophotometer, Portrait Displays’ C6 HDR5000 colorimeter, a Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter, and Leo Bodnar 4K lag tester.

I normally don’t recommend calibration to most people, or for most TVs. Out-of-the-box performance has improved pretty significantly over the past few years across a broad range of prices and manufacturers, as long as you switch out of the default picture mode to something called Movie, Cinema, or Professional. And as I’ve said, the Bravia 8 II looks really great in Professional. But it can still look better. When you say a TV is the one that brings cinema home, the people that are buying it are very likely chasing the best image quality they can get. And for those people, a calibration is worth it. I performed a quick 21-point calibration on the Bravia 8 II, and afterward, the image looked perfect. No more blues in clouds, and colors from skin tones to nature backdrops looked even more incredible.

If we’re being picky, the Bravia 8 II does have two issues specific to QD-OLED panels, but even those are less noticeable than on earlier models. One is the lack of a polarizing filter, which can lead to raised blacks with a slightly purplish color. While there was a little bit of this happening on the Bravia 8 II, it’s better than what I’ve seen on Samsung QD-OLED TVs, and it was barely noticeable in regular use. Even with the lights on in my living room, the blacks felt deep and inky, giving the TV exceptional contrast. And the triangular pixel structure of QD-OLEDs can cause color fringing of either green or purple on the edges of bright images against dark backgrounds. I saw hints of this as well, but from a normal viewing distance it’s only noticeable if you’re intently looking for it. It didn’t bother my family at all. And this too is less noticeable than on early generation QD-OLEDs, though it likely won’t go away entirely until and unless Sony changes the pixel structure on QD-OLED panels.

If I were to buy a TV for myself today, the Sony Bravia 8 II is the one I would get — no question. The picture it produces is incredibly engaging, and throughout my review process I found myself wanting to watch it more and more, even without the calibration. Sure, there are minor issues with some dark scene color fringing, and it doesn’t get as bright as other TVs. A case could be made for the older A95L if you find it discounted, as out of the box it will be a little more accurate than the Bravia 8 II. And for a room that’s absolutely bathed in light, the LG G5 offers very similar performance with a brighter image. But during my time spent with the Sony Bravia 8 II, there was never a moment, be it with critical viewing or watching a movie with my family, when I wasn’t impressed. It reminded me why I love movies. What more could you ask from a TV?

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/14/1131253/data-centers-are-amazing-everyone-hates-them/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Massive structures, with thousands of specialized computer chips running in parallel to perform the complex calculations required by advanced AI models. A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second. Ooooomph.

Given the incredible amounts of capital that the world’s biggest companies have been pouring into building data centers you can make the case (and many people have) that their construction is single-handedly propping up the US stock market and the economy.

So important are they to our way of life that none other than the President of the United States himself, on his very first full day in office, stood side by side with the CEO of OpenAI to announce a $500 billion private investment in data center construction.

Truly, the hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota, where the good citizens of Sioux Falls hurled obscenities at their city councilmembers following a vote to permit a data center on the city’s northeastern side. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia.

So, let’s go to Georgia. The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve had it with data centers.

Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.

This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes. And then… boom!

But things have not played out the way the Assembly and other elected officials may have expected.

Journey with me now to Bolingbroke, Georgia. Not far outside of Atlanta, in Monroe County (population 27,954), county commissioners were considering rezoning 900 acres of land to make room for a new data center near the town of Bolingbroke (population 492). Data centers have been popping up all across the state, but especially in areas close to Atlanta. Public opinion is, often enough, irrelevant. In nearby Twiggs County, despite strong and organized opposition, officials decided to allow a 300-acre data center to move forward. But at a packed meeting to discuss the Bolingbroke plans, some 900 people showed up to voice near unanimous opposition to the proposed data center, according to Macon, Georgia’s The Telegraph. Seeing which way the wind had blown, the Monroe county commission shot it down in August last year.

The would-be developers of the proposed site had claimed it would bring in millions of dollars for the county. That it would be hidden from view. That it would “uphold the highest environmental standards.” That it would bring jobs and prosperity. Yet still, people came gunning for it.

Why!? Data centers have been around for years. So why does everyone hate them all of the sudden?

What is it about these engineering marvels that will allow us to build AI that will cure all diseases, bring unprecedented prosperity, and even cheat death (if you believe what the AI sellers are selling) that so infuriates their prospective neighbors?

There are some obvious reasons. First is just the speed and scale of their construction, which has had effects on power grids. No one likes to see their power bills go up. The rate hikes that so incensed Georgians come as monthly reminders that the eyesore in your backyard profits California billionaires at your expense, on your grid. In Wyoming, for example, a planned Meta data center will require more electricity than every household in the state, combined. To meet demand for power-hungry data centers, utilities are adding capacity to the grid. But although that added capacity may benefit tech companies, the cost is shared by local consumers.

Similarly, there are environmental concerns. To meet their electricity needs, data centers often turn to dirty forms of energy. xAI, for example, famously threw a bunch of polluting methane-powered generators at its data center in Memphis. While nuclear energy is oft-bandied about as a greener solution, traditional plants can take a decade or more to build; even new and more nimble reactors will take years to come online. In addition, data centers often require massive amounts of water. But the amount can vary widely depending on the facility, and is often shrouded in secrecy. (A number of states are attempting to require facilities to disclose water usage.)

A different type of environmental consequence of data centers is that they are noisy. A low, constant, machine hum. Not just sometimes, but always. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. “A highway that never stops.”

And as to the jobs they bring to communities. Well, I have some bad news there too. Once construction ends, they tend to employ very few people, especially for such resource-intensive facilities.

These are all logical reasons to oppose data centers. But I suspect there is an additional, emotional one. And it echoes one we’ve heard before.

More than a decade ago, the large tech firms of Silicon Valley began operating buses to ferry workers to their campuses from San Francisco and other Bay Area cities. Like data centers, these buses used shared resources such as public roads without, people felt, paying their fair share. Protests erupted. But while the protests were certainly about shared resource use, they were also about something much bigger.

Tech companies, big and small, were transforming San Francisco. The early 2010s were a time of rapid gentrification in the city. And what’s more, the tech industry itself was transforming society. Smartphones were newly ubiquitous. The way we interacted with the world was fundamentally changing, and people were, for the most part, powerless to do anything about it. You couldn’t stop Google.

You could stand in front of it and block its path. You could yell at the people getting on it. You could yell at your elected officials and tell them to do something. And in San Francisco, people did. The buses were eventually regulated.

The data center pushback has a similar vibe. AI, we are told, is transforming society. It is suddenly everywhere. Even if you opt not to use ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, generative AI is  increasingly built into just about every app and service you likely use. People are worried AI will harvest jobs in the coming years. Or even kill us all. And for what? So far, the returns have certainly not lived up to the hype.

You can’t stop Google. But maybe, just maybe, you can stop a Google data center.

Then again, maybe not. The tech buses in San Francisco, though regulated, remain commonplace. And the city is more gentrified than ever. Meanwhile, in Monroe County, life goes on. In October, Google confirmed it had purchased 950 acres of land just off the interstate. It plans to build a data center there.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <h2>Belgian cybersecurity startup becomes unicorn</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/aikido-security-becomes-unicorn">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <h2>AI is old news. Generative AI is the future.</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.
