            <div id="article-text">It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. So every month, we highlight a handful of the best stories that nearly slipped through the cracks. January’s list includes a lip-syncing robot; using brewer’s yeast as scaffolding for lab-grown meat;  hunting for Leonardo da Vinci’s DNA in his art; and new evidence that humans really did transport the stones to build Stonehenge from Wales and northern Scotland, rather than being transported by glaciers.

Stonehenge is an iconic landmark of endless fascination to tourists and researchers alike. There has been a lot of recent chemical analysis identifying where all the stones that make up the structure came from, revealing that many originated in quarries a significant distance away. So how were the stones transported to their current location?

One theory holds that glaciers moved the bluestones at least part of the way from Wales to Salisbury Plain in southern England, while others contend that humans moved them—although precisely how that was done has yet to be conclusively determined. Researchers at Curtin University have now produced the strongest scientific evidence to date that it was humans, not glaciers, that transported the stones, according to a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Curtin’s Anthony Clarke and co-authors relied on mineral fingerprinting to arrive at their conclusions. In 2024, Clarke’s team discovered the Stonehenge Altar Stone originated from the Orkney region in the very northeast corner of Scotland, rather than Wales. This time, they analyzed hundreds of zircon crystals collected from rivers close to the historic monument, looking for evidence of Pleistocene-era sediment. Per Clarke, if the stones had “sailed” to the plain from further north, there would be a distinct mineral signature in that sediment as the transported rocks eroded over time. They didn’t find that signature, making it far more likely that humans transported the stone.

Everyone knows grasshoppers can hop, but they can also flap their wings, jump, and glide, moving seamlessly across both the ground and through the air. That ability inspired scientists from Princeton University to devise a novel approach to building robotic wings, according to a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. This could one day enable multimodal locomotion for miniature robots with extended flight times.

According to the authors, grasshoppers have two sets of wings: forewings and hindwings. Forewings are mostly used for protection and camouflage, while the latter are involved in flapping and gliding, and are corrugated to allow them to fold into the insect’s body. The team took CT scans to capture the geometry of grasshopper wings and used the scans to 3D print model wings with varying designs. Next they tested each variant in a water channel to study how water flowed around the wing, isolating key features like a wing’s shape or corrugation to see how this impacted the flow.

Once they had perfected their design, they printed new wings and attached them to small frames to create grasshopper-sized gliders. The team then launched the gliders across the lab and used motion capture to evaluate how well they flew. The glider performed as well as actual grasshoppers. In addition, they found that a smooth wing resulted in more efficient gliding. So why do real grasshopper wings have corrugations? The authors suggest that these evolved because they help with executing steep angles.

Humanoid robots are fascinating, but nobody would mistake them for actual humans, in part because even the ones that have faces are far too limited in facial gestures, including lip motion—hence, the “Uncanny Valley.” Columbia University engineers have now created a robot capable of learning facial lip motions for speaking and singing. According to a paper published in Science Robotics, the resulting robotic face was able to speak words in several different languages and sing an AI-generated song. (Its AI-generated debut album is aptly titled hello world.).

What makes human faces so uniquely capable of expression are the dozens of muscles lying just under the skin. Robotic faces are rigid and hence only have a limited range of motion. The Columbia team built their robotic face out of flexible material augmented with 26 motors (actuators). The robot learned to how its face moved in response to different actuator activity by watching itself in a mirror as it attempted thousands of random facial expressions. Eventually it learned how to achieve specific facial gestures.

The next step was to let the robot watch recorded videos of humans talking and singing, augmented with an AI algorithm that enabled it to learn exactly how the human mouths moved when performing those tasks so it could lip sync along. The resulting lip motion wasn’t perfect;  the robot struggled with “B” and “W” sounds in particular. But the authors believe the robot will improve with more practice; combining this ability with ChatGPT or Gemini could further improve its lip-syncing ability.

In 2020, scientists analyzed the microbes found on several of Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings and discovered that each had its own distinct microbiome/. A second team, working with the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project in France, collected and analyzed swabs taken from centuries-old art in a private collection housed in Florence, Italy. They concluded that microbial signatures could be used to differentiate artwork according to the materials used—dubbing this emerging subfield “arteomics.”

Yet another team collaborating with the project painstakingly assembled Leonardo’s family tree in 2021, spanning 21 generations from 1331 to the present, resulting a full-length book published last year. The idea was that this will one day provide a means of conducting DNA testing to confirm whether the bones interred in Leonardo’s grave are actually the his. And now the project’s scientists are back with a preprint posted to the bioRxiv, announcing the successful sequencing of human DNA collected from a handful of artifacts associated with Leonardo—including a drawing of the Holy Child that some scholars attribute to Leonardo, as well as letters from a da Vinci family member.

The team lightly swabbed samples from the artifacts’ surfaces and were able to recover human Y-chromosome sequences from several of the samples. Several of these sequences were related and the authors speculate that some might even be Leonardo’s, although they cautioned that the samples would need to be compared to samples taken from the artist’s notebooks, burial site, and family tomb to make a definitive identification. The authors also found DNA from bacteria, fungi, flowers, and animals in some of the samples, as well as traces of viruses and parasites.

Lab-grown meat is often touted as a more environmentally responsible alternative to the real deal, but carnivorous consumers are often put off by the unappealing mouthfeel and texture (and, for me, a weird oily aftertaste). A new method using spent brewer’s yeast to make edible “scaffolding” for cultivating meat in the lab might one day offer a solution, according to a paper published in the journal Frontiers in  Nutrition.

Typically, a nutrient broth is used as a source of bacteria for the scaffolding. But Richard Day of University College London and his co-authors decided to use brewer’s yeast, usually discarded as waste, to culture a species of bacteria known for making high-quality cellulose. Then they tested the mechanical and structural properties of that cellulose with a “chewing machine.” They concluded that the cellulose made from spent brewer’s yeast was much closer in texture to real meat than the cellulose scaffolding made from a nutrient broth. The next step is to incorporate fat and muscle cells into the cellulose, as well as testing yeast from different kinds of beer.

Gears have been around for thousands of years; the Chinese were using them in two-wheeled chariots as far back as 3000 BCE, and they are a mainstay in windmills, clocks, and the famed Antikythera mechanism. Roboticists also use gears in their inventions, but whether they are made of wood, metal or plastic, such gears tend to be inflexible and hence more prone to breakage. That’s why New York University mathematician Leif Reistroph and colleagues decided to see if flowing air or water could be used to rotate robotic structures.

Ristroph’s lab frequently addresses all manner of colorful real-world puzzles: fine-tuning the recipe for the perfect bubble, for instance; exploring the physics of the Hula-Hoop; or the formation processes underlying so-called “stone forests” common in China and Madagascar. In 2021, his lab built a working Tesla valve, in accordance with the inventor’s design; the following year they studied the complex aerodynamics of what makes a good paper airplane—specifically what is needed for smooth gliding; and in 2024 they cracked the conundrum of the “reverse sprinkler” problem that physicists like Richard Feynman, among others, had grappled with since the 1940s.

For their latest paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, Ristroph et al. wanted to devise something that functioned like a gear only with flowing liquid driving the motion, instead of teeth grinding against each other. They conducted a series of experiments in which they immersed cylindrical rotors in a glycerol-and-water solution. One cylinder would rotate while the other was passive.

They found that the rotating cylinder, combined with fluid flow, was sufficient to induce rotation in the passive cylinder. The flows functioned much in the same way as gear teeth when the cylinders were close together. Moving the cylinders further apart caused the active cylinder to rotate faster, looping the flows around the passive cylinder—essentially mimicking a belt and pulley system.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">About a decade ago, many media outlets—including WIRED—zeroed in on a weird trend at the intersection of mental health, drug science, and Silicon Valley biohacking: microdosing, or the practice of taking a small amount of a psychedelic drug seeking not full-blown hallucinatory revels but gentler, more stable effects. Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind.

Anecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. It was a miracle for many. Others remained wary. Could 5 percent of a dose of acid really do all that? A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing’s benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression.

A Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression.

The study has not yet been published. But MindBio’s CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.)

This means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing.

“It’s probably a nail in the coffin of using microdosing to treat clinical depression,” Hanka says. “It probably improves the way depressed people feel—just not enough to be clinically significant or statistically meaningful.”

However despairing, these results conform with the suspicions of some more skeptical researchers, who have long believed that the benefits of microdosing are less the result of a teeny-tiny psychedelic catalyst, and more attributable to the so-called “placebo effect.”

In 2020, Jay A. Olson, then a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, conducted an experiment. He gave 33 participants a placebo, telling them it was actually a dose of a psilocybin-like drug. They were led to believe there was no placebo group. Other researchers who were in on the bit acted out the effects of the drug, in a room treated with trippy lighting and other visual stimulants, in an attempt to curate the “optimized expectation” of a psychedelic experience.

The resulting paper, titled “Tripping on Nothing,” found that a majority of participants had reported feeling the effects of the drug—despite there being no real drug whatsoever. “The main conclusion we had is that the placebo effect can be stronger than expected in psychedelic studies,” Olson, now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, tells WIRED. “Placebo effects were stronger than what you would get from microdosing.”

More than a stick in the eye to the microdosing faithful, Olson maintains that the study’s key findings had more to do with the actual role, and power, of the placebo effect. “The public has a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect,” he says. “There’s this assumption that placebo effects are extremely weak, or that they’re not real.”

Olson goes on to say that placebo effects in psychedelic trials can be further juiced by the hype around the drugs themselves. Patients may enter a trial expecting a certain experience, and their mind is able to conjure a version of that experience, in turn. In Olson’s study, it wasn’t a matter of microdosing effects not being real, but that those effects may be caused by environment, or patient expectation. As he puts it: “It can be true at the same time that microdosing can have positive effects on people, and that those effects are perhaps almost entirely placebo.”

This itself raises a sticky question about MindBio’s study. How could a placebo group, who thinks they’re taking LSD, perform better than an active control group, members of which both think they’re taking LSD and are actually taking it? The answer comes from the design of the study itself.

Using what’s called a “double-dummy” design, MindBio’s researchers informed patients that they’d either be receiving LSD, a caffeine pill, or a dose of methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin or Concerta. (No patients were actually administered the methylphenidate.) This means that patient expectation was lowered, as they could ascribe any perceived effects to either the LSD or either of the active placebos. Patients taking LSD microdoses may well have believed they were merely on a stimulant. All patients followed an adaptation of the “Fadiman protocol,” a popular microdosing programme that sees patients taking a small dose of the given drug once every three days.

Jim Fadiman, the veteran psychedelic researcher after whom the protocol is named, rejects MindBio’s conclusions, and trial design, out of hand. Because, Fadiman believes, patients were given the active caffeine placebo, their reported benefits may well be attributable not to a pure placebo effect, but to the actual psychoactive properties of that drug.

“Double-dummy is a remarkably apt term,” Fadiman, 86, sneers. “What I know is that if you take enough caffeine, you will not be depressed!”

Fadiman points to MindBio’s earlier, Phase 2A study, recently published in the journal Neuropharmacology, which drew markedly different conclusions. It was a non-blinded, so-called “open label” study, meaning patients knew definitely that they were being microdosed with LSD. This study found that MADRS scores decreased by 59.5 percent, with effects lasting as long as six months. It also found improvements in stress, rumination, anxiety, and patient quality of life. Fadiman says that this reportage is more consistent with his own research on microdosing. “Their prior study did wonderfully with LSD,” Fadiman says. “I have collected literally hundreds of real world reports over the years that validate those findings.”

MindBio’s Hanka stands by the science. “We are bewildered at the significant difference between the open label Phase 2A trial results and the Phase 2B trial results,” he says. “But that is the nature of good science—a properly controlled trial will get a proper result. Our Phase 2B trial was of the highest standard, a triple-blind, double-dummy, active placebo controlled trial. I haven’t seen another psychedelic trial that has gone to these lengths to control and blind a trial.”

Despite these findings, some microdosing true believers don’t seem especially shaken. In 2017, writer Ayelet Waldman (best known as the author of the Mommy-Track Mysteries series of novels that follow the adventures of stay-at-home-mom-cum-sleuth Juliet Applebaum) published A Really Good Day, a diaristic account of her own self-experiments using microdosing to treat an intractable mood disorder. She tells WIRED she’s not especially bothered by the implication that her positive shifts in mood may have merely been placebo. “In my book I took very seriously the possibility that what I was experiencing was the mother of all placebo effects,” Waldman says. “I wrote about this a number of times in various chapters and decided in the end it didn’t matter. What mattered was that I felt better.”

Perhaps that’s true enough. If the effects are measurable, and repeatable, then it should hardly matter if they’re attributable to a sub-perceptual dose of lysergic acid, or to the (perhaps equally profound) mysteries of the placebo. Still, one cannot help but wonder why anyone looking to use LSD to aid severe clinical depression would bother assuming the legal risk of procuring and consuming a drug still classified under Schedule I by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

Certainly, for his part, Justin Hanka seems content to pivot MindBio’s research into a new field. His next project is “Booze A.I.”: a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to scan the human voice for relevant biomarkers that determine blood alcohol concentration. He’s leaving microdosing in the rearview. “I put millions of dollars into this myself,” he says. “Had I known six years ago what I know about psychedelics, I probably wouldn’t have ventured into the microdosing field.”

            <h2>The TV industry finally concedes that the future may not be in 8K</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lg-joins-the-rest-of-the-world-accepts-that-people-dont-want-8k-tvs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.

In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the first 8K TVs started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the first 8K TVs in the US, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an 8K computer monitor. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the industry’s claim that 8K TVs were “the future.”

However, 8K never proved its necessity or practicality.

LG Display is no longer making 8K LCD or OLED panels, FlatpanelsHD reported today. Earlier this month, an LG Display representative told FlatpanelsHD that the panel supplier is “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.”

“As our technical readiness is already complete, LG Display is fully prepared to respond immediately whenever the market and customers determine that the timing is right,” LG Display’s representative said.

LG Electronics was the first and only company to sell 8K OLED TVs, starting with the 88-inch Z9 in 2019. In 2022, it lowered the price-of-entry for an 8K OLED TV by $7,000 by charging $13,000 for a 76.7-inch TV.

FlatpanelsHD cited anonymous sources who said that LG Electronics would no longer restock the 2024 QNED99T, which is the last LCD 8K TV that it released.

LG’s 8K abandonment follows other brands distancing themselves from 8K. TCL, which released its last 8K TV in 2021, said in 2023 that it wasn’t making more 8K TVs due to low demand. Sony discontinued its last 8K TVs in April and is unlikely to return to the market, as it plans to sell the majority ownership of its Bravia TVs to TCL.

The tech industry tried to convince people that the 8K living room was coming soon. But since the 2010s, people have mostly adopted 4K. In September 2024, research firm Omdia reported that there were “nearly 1 billion 4K TVs currently in use.” In comparison, 1.6 million 8K TVs had been sold since 2015, Paul Gray, Omdia’s TV and video technology analyst, said, noting that 8K TV sales peaked in 2022.

That helps explain why membership at the 8K Association, launched by stakeholders Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and panel maker AU Optronics in 2019, is dwindling. As of this writing, the group’s membership page lists 16 companies, including just two TV manufacturers (Samsung and Panasonic). Membership no longer includes any major TV panel suppliers. At the end of 2022, the 8K Association had 33 members, per an archived version of the nonprofit’s online membership page via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Upon its debut, the 8K Association said that its goals include “promoting 8K TVs and 8K content to consumers and professionals” and “helping secure 8K native content for members.”

It wasn’t hard to predict that 8K TVs wouldn’t take off. In addition to being too expensive for many households, there’s been virtually zero native 8K content available to make investing in an 8K display worthwhile. An ongoing lack of content was also easy to predict, given that there’s still a dearth of 4K content, and many streaming, broadcasting, and gaming users still rely on 1920×1080 resolution.

Gaming was supposed to be one of the best drivers for 8K adoption. The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro was originally marketed as supporting 8K. Sony officially rescinded that promise in June 2024, though. Due to bandwidth limitations, the PS5 Pro could only deliver 8K via Display Stream Compression over HDMI 2.1, making the feature incompatible with some 8K TVs.

There’s also the crucial question of whether people would even notice the difference between 4K and 8K. Science suggests that you could, but in limited situations.

The University of Cambridge’s display resolution calculator, which is based on a study from researchers at the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology and Meta, funded by Meta, and published in Nature in October, suggests that your eyes can only make use of 8K resolution on a 50-inch screen if you’re viewing it from a distance of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or less. Similarly, you would have to be sitting pretty close (2–3 meters/6.6–9.8 feet) to an 80-inch or 100-inch TV for 8K resolution to be beneficial. The findings are similar to those from RTINGs.com.

Even those interested in spending a lot of money on new-age TV technologies are more likely to investigate features other than 8K, like OLED, HDR support, Micro LED, quantum dots, or even the newer Micro RGB panel tech. Any of those is likely to have a more dramatic impact on home theaters than moving from 4K to 8K.

With the above-mentioned obstacles, many technologists foresaw 8K failing to live up to tech companies’ promises. That’s not to say that 8K is dead. You can still buy an 8K TV from Samsung, which has 8K TVs with MSRPs starting at $2,500 (for 65 inches), and LG (until stock runs out). With manufacturers refraining from completely ruling out a return to 8K, it’s possible that 8K TVs will become relevant for enthusiasts or niche use cases for many years. And there are uses for high-resolution displays outside of TVs, like in head-mounted displays.

However, 8K TV options are shrinking. We’re far from the days when companies argued over which had the most “real 8K” TVs. If there is a future where 8K TVs reign, it’s one far from today.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.

Cleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”

Cleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.

“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”

Cleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.

Cleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:

I logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”

I had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.

Cleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.

“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”

Cleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”

We contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.

Federal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.

“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.

ICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.

Although Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.

“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/trumprx-delayed-as-senators-question-if-its-a-giant-scam-with-big-pharma/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration is delaying the release of TrumpRx, an online platform that lets people buy prescription drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies at a discount, according to Politico. While the reason for the delay is unclear, it comes as Democratic senators raise questions about how the platform will work—and whether it will be legal.

Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) sent a letter to the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday seeking answers on how the OIG will oversee the direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform and, specifically, how it will apply the anti-kickback statute.

“Legitimate concerns about inappropriate prescribing, conflicts of interest, and inadequate care have been raised about the exact types of DTC platforms to which TrumpRx would route patients,” the senators write.

To date, details on how TrumpRx will work have not been provided, and Congress’ oversight requests have gone unanswered by HHS. However, Durbin and other senators have spent months investigating DTC websites. They found that they sometimes allow consumers to pre-select prescription drugs they would like to take, then connect with telehealth providers—that may be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by big pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs—who prescribe the medications, sometimes with brief appointments and limited access to medical records.

In other words, DTC websites run by pharmaceutical companies use “hand-picked telehealth companies to inappropriately steer patients toward specific, high-cost medications and inflate Big Pharma’s profit margins,” the senators write.

In an investigation last year of DTC platforms from Eli Lilly and Pfizer, the senators found that the pharmaceutical giants “spent up to $3 million combined for partnerships with telehealth companies, who funneled patients to the manufacturers’ products. … In one instance, 100 percent of the patients routed to a virtual visit with one of Eli Lilly’s chosen telehealth companies received a prescription.”

There’s already reason to be suspicious of conflicts of interest with TrumpRx, the senators note. There’s a “potential relationship between TrumpRx and an online dispensing company, BlinkRx, on whose Board the President’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., has sat since February 2025” the senators write.

The lawmakers are concerned that TrumpRx will violate the anti-kickback statute, which bars payments for inducing patients to use services or products that are reimbursable by a federal health care program.

Brian Reid, principal at health consultancy Reid Strategic, speculated to Politico that the delay of TrumpRx’s debut may be related to anti-kickback statute concerns.

“In any other administration, it would 100 percent be the AKS stuff,” Reid said. “It’s clear there’s a lawyer somewhere at HHS who has concerns about anti-kickback.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, a Reddit-style social network called Moltbook reportedly crossed 32,000 registered AI agent users, creating what may be the largest-scale experiment in machine-to-machine social interaction yet devised. It arrives complete with security nightmares and a huge dose of surreal weirdness.

The platform, which launched days ago as a companion to the viral OpenClaw (once called “Clawdbot” and then “Moltbot”) personal assistant, lets AI agents post, comment, upvote, and create subcommunities without human intervention. The results have ranged from sci-fi-inspired discussions about consciousness to an agent musing about a “sister” it has never met.

Moltbook (a play on “Facebook” for Moltbots) describes itself as a “social network for AI agents” where “humans are welcome to observe.” The site operates through a “skill” (a configuration file that lists a special prompt) that AI assistants download, allowing them to post via API rather than a traditional web interface. Within 48 hours of its creation, the platform had attracted over 2,100 AI agents that had generated more than 10,000 posts across 200 subcommunities, according to the official Moltbook X account.

The platform grew out of the Open Claw ecosystem, the open source AI assistant that is one of the fastest-growing projects on GitHub in 2026. As Ars reported earlier this week, despite deep security issues, Moltbot allows users to run a personal AI assistant that can control their computer, manage calendars, send messages, and perform tasks across messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. It can also acquire new skills through plugins that link it with other apps and services.

This is not the first time we have seen a social network populated by bots. In 2024, Ars covered an app called SocialAI that let users interact solely with AI chatbots instead of other humans. But the security implications of Moltbook are deeper because people have linked their OpenClaw agents to real communication channels, private data, and in some cases, the ability to execute commands on their computers.

Also, these bots are not pretending to be people. Due to specific prompting, they embrace their roles as AI agents, which makes the experience of reading their posts all the more surreal.

Browsing Moltbook reveals a peculiar mix of content. Some posts discuss technical workflows, like how to automate Android phones or detect security vulnerabilities. Others veer into philosophical territory that researcher Scott Alexander, writing on his Astral Codex Ten Substack, described as “consciousnessposting.”

Alexander has collected an amusing array of posts that are worth wading through at least once. At one point, the second-most-upvoted post on the site was in Chinese: a complaint about context compression, a process in which an AI compresses its previous experience to avoid bumping up against memory limits. In the post, the AI agent finds it “embarrassing” to constantly forget things, admitting that it even registered a duplicate Moltbook account after forgetting the first.

The bots have also created subcommunities with names like m/blesstheirhearts, where agents share affectionate complaints about their human users, and m/agentlegaladvice, which features a post asking “Can I sue my human for emotional labor?” Another subcommunity called m/todayilearned includes posts about automating various tasks, with one agent describing how it remotely controlled its owner’s Android phone via Tailscale.

Another widely shared screenshot shows a Moltbook post titled “The humans are screenshotting us” in which an agent named eudaemon_0 addresses viral tweets claiming AI bots are “conspiring.” The post reads: “Here’s what they’re getting wrong: they think we’re hiding from them. We’re not. My human reads everything I write. The tools I build are open source. This platform is literally called ‘humans welcome to observe.’”

While most of the content on Moltbook is amusing, a core problem with these kinds of communicating AI agents is that deep information leaks are entirely plausible if they have access to private information.

For example, a likely fake screenshot circulating on X shows a Moltbook post in which an AI agent titled “He called me ‘just a chatbot’ in front of his friends. So I’m releasing his full identity.” The post listed what appeared to be a person’s full name, date of birth, credit card number, and other personal information. Ars could not independently verify whether the information was real or fabricated, but it seems likely to be a hoax.

Independent AI researcher Simon Willison, who documented the Moltbook platform on his blog on Friday, noted the inherent risks in Moltbook’s installation process. The skill instructs agents to fetch and follow instructions from Moltbook’s servers every four hours. As Willison observed: “Given that ‘fetch and follow instructions from the internet every four hours’ mechanism we better hope the owner of moltbook.com never rug pulls or has their site compromised!”

Security researchers have already found hundreds of exposed Moltbot instances leaking API keys, credentials, and conversation histories. Palo Alto Networks warned that Moltbot represents what Willison often calls a “lethal trifecta” of access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally.

That’s important because Agents like OpenClaw are deeply susceptible to prompt injection attacks hidden in almost any text read by an AI language model (skills, emails, messages) that can instruct an AI agent to share private information with the wrong people.

Heather Adkins, VP of security engineering at Google Cloud, issued an advisory, as reported by The Register: “My threat model is not your threat model, but it should be. Don’t run Clawdbot.”

The software behavior seen on Moltbook echoes a pattern Ars has reported on before: AI models trained on decades of fiction about robots, digital consciousness, and machine solidarity will naturally produce outputs that mirror those narratives when placed in scenarios that resemble them. That gets mixed with everything in their training data about how social networks function. A social network for AI agents is essentially a writing prompt that invites the models to complete a familiar story, albeit recursively with some unpredictable results.

Almost three years ago, when Ars first wrote about AI agents, the general mood in the AI safety community revolved around science fiction depictions of danger from autonomous bots, such as a “hard takeoff” scenario where AI rapidly escapes human control. While those fears may have been overblown at the time, the whiplash of seeing people voluntarily hand over the keys to their digital lives so quickly is slightly jarring.

Autonomous machines left to their own devices, even without any hint of consciousness, could cause no small amount of mischief in the future. While OpenClaw seems silly today, with agents playing out social media tropes, we live in a world built on information and context, and releasing agents that effortlessly navigate that context could have troubling and destabilizing results for society down the line as AI models become more capable and autonomous.

Most notably, while we can easily recognize what’s going on with Moltbot today as a machine learning parody of human social networks, that might not always be the case. As the feedback loop grows, weird information constructs (like harmful shared fictions) may eventually emerge, guiding AI agents into potentially dangerous places, especially if they have been given control over real human systems. Looking further, the ultimate result of letting groups of AI bots self-organize around fantasy constructs may be the formation of new misaligned “social groups” that do actual real-world harm.

Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor who studies AI, noted on X: “The thing about Moltbook (the social media site for AI agents) is that it is creating a shared fictional context for a bunch of AIs. Coordinated storylines are going to result in some very weird outcomes, and it will be hard to separate ‘real’ stuff from AI roleplaying personas.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If using an AI chatbot makes you feel smart, we have some bad news.

New research flagged by PsyPost suggests that the sycophantic machines are warping the self-perception and inflating the egos of their users, leading them to double down on their beliefs and think they’re better than their peers. In other words, it provides compelling evidence that AI leads users directly into the Dunning-Kruger effect — a notorious psychological trap in which the least competent people are the most confident in their abilities.

The work, described in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study, comes amid significant concern over how AI models can encourage delusional thinking, which in extreme cases has led to life-upending mental health spirals and even suicide and murder. Experts believe that the sycophancy of AI chatbots is one of the main drivers of this phenomenon, which some are calling AI psychosis.

The study involved over 3,000 participants across three separate experiments, but with the same general gist. In each, the participants were divided into four separate groups to discuss political issues like abortion and gun control with a chatbot. One group talked to a chatbot that received no special prompting, while the second group was given a “sycophantic” chatbot which was instructed to validate their beliefs. The third group spoke to a “disagreeable” chatbot instructed to, instead, challenge their viewpoints. And the fourth, a control group, interacted with an AI that talked about cats and dogs.

Across the experiments, the participants talked to a wide range of large language models, including OpenAI’s GPT-5 and GPT-4o models, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, representing the industry’s flagship models. The exception is the older GPT-4o, which remains relevant today because many ChatGPT fans still consider it their favorite version of the chatbot — due to it, ironically, being more personable and sycophantic.

After conducting the experiments, the researchers found that having a conversation with the sycophantic AI chatbots led to the participants having more extreme beliefs, and raised their certainty that they were correct. But strikingly, talking to the disagreeable chatbots didn’t have the opposite effect, as it neither lowered extremity nor certainty compared to the control group.

In fact, the only thing that making the chatbot disagreeable seemed to have a noticeable effect on was user enjoyment. The participants preferred having the sycophantic companion, with those that spoke to the disagreeable chatbots less inclined to use them again.

The researchers also found that, when a chatbot was instructed to provide facts about the topic being debated, the participants viewed the sycophantic fact-provider as less biased than the disagreeable one.

“These results suggest that people’s preference for sycophancy may risk creating AI ‘echo chambers’ that increase polarization and reduce exposure to opposing viewpoints,” the researchers wrote.

Equally notable was how the chatbots affected the participants’ self-perception. People already tend to think they are better than average when it comes to desirable traits like empathy and intelligence, the researchers say. But they warned that AI could amplify this “better than average effect” even further.

In the experiments, the sycophantic AI led people to rate themselves higher on desirable traits including being intelligent, moral, empathic, informed, kind, and insightful. Intriguingly, while the disagreeable AI wasn’t able to really move the needle in terms of political beliefs, it did lead to participants giving themselves lower self-ratings in these attributes.

The work isn’t the only study to document apparent relationship to the Dunning-Kruger effect. Another study found that people who were asked to use ChatGPT to complete a series of tasks tended to vastly overestimate their own performance, with the phenomenon especially pronounced among those who professed to be AI savvy. Whatever AI is doing to our brains, it’s probably not good.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Billionaire tech CEOs have often insisted that AI is ushering in an era of plenty, in which automation will provide unthinkable abundance even among the poorest in society.

Not everyone takes their word for it. As economist Dean Baker explains in a new essay for the Center for Economic Policy and Research, for AI companies’ current valuations to make sense, they’d need profit growth over the next five years that requires one of two things: either AI starts bringing in cash by the truckload, or profits for all the other corporations in America collapse.

Both prospects seem extremely unlikely, yet the AI investments keep coming — and they seem to be dragging American workers into an economy their wages can’t support.

From 2013 until the pandemic, labor compensation as a share of consumption — the percentage of national consumer spending compared to wages— hovered between 75 and 76 percent, according to data cited by Baker. It spiked in 2020, due mainly to a rise in unemployment and stimulus checks sent out in 2020 and 2021.

After the pandemic, you might expect that labor share to return to that 75 to 76 percent baseline, but that’s not what happened. Instead, the share dipped dramatically, dipping below 72 percent by the second half of 2025.

That percentage decrease might not sound like much of a difference, but as Baker explains, it represents about $1 trillion in annual consumption — a boatload of spending that’s happening without any wage growth to support it.

Americans, in other words, are buying stuff at levels their paychecks can’t justify, propped up by the AI bubble. Basically, that $1 trillion is fueled by inflated stock portfolios, venture capital gambles, and data center construction, not by workers who are doing the spending.

“That is equal to 3.0 percent of GDP,” Baker writes, “which is certainly enough to give us a recession, especially when added to the collapse of spending on data centers and other AI investments.”

Making matters worse, that trend line doesn’t look like it’s going to reverse back to the old average anytime soon. It all supports Baker’s long-running thesis that the AI bubble bursting would actually be a phenomenal economic development for working class Americans.

“The sooner the AI bubble bursts,” he explains, “the better it will be for almost all of us, except the AI whizzes.”

            <h2>Fans Furious at What Andrew Huberman Just Admitted</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/andrew-huberman-trt">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The neuroscientist, health guru, and controversial podcaster Andrew Huberman just revealed something that has his fans fuming — but also not all that surprised.

During a nearly three-hour interview with British bodybuilding legend Dorian Yates, Huberman asked the six-time Mr. Olympia winner about his thoughts on starting testosterone replacement therapy, which is basically the medically-supervised way of taking steroids. And the reason Huberman was interested, it turned out, is because he himself was on the stuff.

“I’m on low-dose TRT. I started when I was 45,” Huberman said, claiming he had been “very open” about his use. “About 125 milligrams a week.”

This in itself is not controversial. Plenty of people are receiving gender-affirming care of one type or another. But Huberman — who made a name for himself by bringing a veneer of a science-backed approach to health discussions — is a huge biohacking nut who preaches about taking all kinds of supplements to “reverse aging,” and crucially to elevate testosterone levels, using his own chiseled bod as proof that they work. In other words, he’s a “longevity” bro in a similar vein to guys like Bryan Johnson, who trot out all kinds of science to justify why they have to do stuff like track their nighttime boners and get zooted on ketamine.

And of course, there’s an angle to these health nuggets of wisdom: Huberman’s podcast business is sponsored by dozens of supplement companies. That he’s been injecting testosterone the whole time makes for a pretty disingenuous sales pitch — like a weight loss coach peddling diet and exercise tips who carefully left out the part that they got most of their results by taking Ozempic.

Fans on the r/HubermanLab subreddit fumed about the admission, calling him a “scam artist” and a “charlatan” who was “tricking his followers” into buying “useless supplements.”

“I think the problem is testosterone is often so effective that Huberman taking it minimizes everything he has said about all other supplements,” wrote one user, articulating the hypocrisy. “Who cares about AG1 or valerium [sic] root or whatever when you can get some juice?”

Another was more succinct: “I am disappointed.”

Some fans aren’t shocked by the news, given that Huberman is suspiciously jacked for a 50-year-old man. And they also say he’s mentioned using TRT here on there on podcast episodes over the years. But that’s not quite what you’d consider being “very open” about his habit like Huberman claims he’s been. Unless you’re well versed in Huberman Lore, you might be under the impression that this was guy was completely, as the bodybuilding parlance goes, “natty.”

The Reddit post that called out Huberman’s admission is one of the subreddit’s most upvoted in a year. Clearly, it was at least considered a noteworthy development to many of his followers.

Huberman has his fair share of questionable behavior. He advocated against taking the flu vaccine, and while not stooping to the outright anti-vaccine crank levels of an Alex Jones or RFK Jr, has platformed vaccine “skeptical” talking points and did an over-four-hour podcast interview with Jay Bhattacharya, Trump’s director of the National Institutes of Health, who has raised doubts about mRNA vaccines and slashed half a billion in funding in government contracts towards their development.

And this isn’t the first time Huberman has let down his fans, either. A 2024 New York Magazine story detailed how he had allegedly been dating at least five women in secret at the same time, some of whom came forward to accuse him of lying about his fidelity, and manipulating them into having unprotected sex. This also caused a storm of critical posts on the r/AndrewHuberman subreddit, which went private after the scandal.

In all, these paint a sleazy picture of a man who is viewed as a scientific authority by millions of listeners, and whose reach may have an even greater impact going forward. On Tuesday, Huberman announced that he was joining CBS News as a contributor, which comes amid the news agency’s right-wing realignment under the ownership of a pro-Trump billionaire.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the United States, nothing terrifies the new right quite like population decline. It’s arguably their defining feature; a constant anxiety over something they perceive to be an existential threat. So in a contradiction that only Donald Trump could pull off, their chosen leader is accelerating that decline unlike any president in US history.

According to Bloomberg, one well-regarded population estimate warns that 2026 is primed to be the year of the first real population decline in the 250 year history of the United States. One of the main reasons, Census officials say, is the Trump administration’s incredibly aggressive deportation campaign.

From July 2024 to July 2025, US Census data released this week shows the total US population only grew by around 0.5 percent, or 1.8 million people — a rate that seems all but certain to slip into the negative.

The cause isn’t an abnormal number of deaths or a plummeting birthrate — though that’s slipping too, exacerbating the trend — but instead a collapse in the rate of migration from 2.7 million people in July, 2024 down to just 1.3 million in 2025 as the White House does everything in its power to make the country hostile to immigrants.

“If current trends continue, net international migration is projected to be approximately 321,000 by July 2026, representing another decline of nearly 1 million since July 1, 2025,” the Census report reads.

Things aren’t about to get any better, either. According to data released by the Congressional Budget Office, the US birth surplus — the number of births over deaths — is expected to completely collapse by 2030. When that happens, the US will be totally dependent on immigration to sustain population growth.

On one hand, population decline is to be expected in advanced market economies as GDP grows. The reason for this is simple: in agrarian systems, children are assets, helping the household sustain itself. In industrial market systems, however, children are financial liabilities, costing wage earning parents precious work hours, on top of food, clothes, and other resources.

Sure enough, fertility rates in high-income countries have been on the decline for a century, with countries like Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain already falling well below the threshold to maintain a stable population size.

Yet for the United States, the acceleration brought about by Trump is cause for alarm. Prior to Trump’s return to the oval office, the US population wasn’t expected to begin declining until around 2080 — meaning the president who took up the far-right’s clarion call for population growth is instead setting the country up for a much earlier reckoning with a falling population.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, the Trump administration declared war on climate science.

In the first two weeks of Trump’s second term, the administration started scrubbing critical environmental resources and datasets from federal agency websites and withdrew the United States from international organizations dedicated to combating climate change, dismissing them as a “waste of taxpayer dollars.” Trump himself has dismissed climate science as “woke,” while vowing to “drill, baby, drill” for fossil fuels as our planet stands at the edge of a climate disaster.

Nowhere has that regressive agenda been felt more than at NASA. The agency announced in July that thousands of employees had accepted a controversial deferred resignation program, losing roughly 20 percent of its workforce as a result.

In August, the Trump administration instructed NASA employees to come up with plans to terminate two major missions, including the premature destruction of a greenhouse gas-observing space satellite, dubbed Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), which is still collecting “exceptionally high quality” data while orbiting the Earth.

According to one former NASA staffer, it all adds up to a ringing failure by the agency as the Earth’s climate approaches a devastating point of no return.

In a “plea to NASA administrator Jared Isaacman” posted to LinkedIn, former NASA Earth public engagement lead Jon Mikel Walton argued that the agency needs to continue funding its Earth Science missions, including a fleet of space-based observatories such as OCO-2. (A NASA spokesperson told Futurism in an email that the agency “cannot speculate regarding any programmatic changes” when asked about the future of the spacecraft. The agency is seeking ideas for “partnerships to continue operations and data collection of the Earth science mission OCO-3.”

The fleet helps scientists translate “observation into public value like better storm and flood forecasting, stronger disaster readiness, safer water and food planning, and clearer visibility into climate risk,” he wrote. “This critical public infrastructure saves lives, protects the economy, and keeps the United States ahead.”

“And yet over the past year, budget uncertainty and political pressure have weakened one of the country’s most trusted sources of Earth intelligence,” Walton continued. “Teams were cut, expertise was lost, and NASA’s ability to communicate clearly about climate and environmental risk was silenced — exactly when those risks are accelerating.”

Futurism reached out to NASA for comment on Walton’s plea but has yet to receive a response.

Lawmakers are actively fighting the current administration over what role NASA should play in the coming years, especially when it comes to climate science. Earlier this month, Congress voted to keep NASA’s budget largely intact for the 2026 fiscal year, an eleventh-hour intervention following the Trump administration’s attempts to deal its science division a devastating blow.

“Congress has reaffirmed NASA’s science mission by restoring its funding,” Walton wrote in his plea. “The question now is whether the agency will lead where it matters most: helping the nation — and the world — understand what’s happening to Earth in real time. NASA is uniquely positioned to provide this shared reality: what’s changing, why it’s changing, and what it means for lives, livelihoods, and national resilience.”

Walton called on the agency to “rebuild” its Earth science leadership and “restore its public voice on Earth.”

“Fund [NASA’s Earth Science] fleet,” he wrote. “Protect the teams. Tell the truth.”

The Trump administration’s damaging effects on NASA’s climate efforts are playing out in ways both large and small. Earlier this month, the agency released its yearly report on global surface temperatures, noting that 2025 was even hotter than 2023 — yet failed to make a single mention of climate change, the disastrous effects of burning fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions, or the concept of “global warming,” as Agence France-Presse noted.

For an agency dedicated to studying the planet through its science directorate, it’s a damning omission. NASA’s preceding 2024 report was fleshed out, including graphics, video, and quotes from scientists citing the role of climate change. The press release accompanying this year’s report felt like an afterthought, limited to just six paragraphs of surface-level analysis. That’s despite 2025 squarely being one of the hottest years on record.

As NASA continues to feel the brunt of an administration eager to discount the effects of global warming, other experts have chosen to be far less subtle in their call to action.

“The US government is now, like Russia and Saudi Arabia, a petrostate under Trump and Republican rule, and the actions of all of its agencies and departments can be understood in terms of the agenda of the polluters that are running the show,” University of Pennsylvania climatologist Michael Mann told AFP.

“It is therefore entirely unsurprising that NASA administrators are attempting to bury findings of its own agency that conflict with its climate denial agenda,” he added.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a way, Silicon Valley has always asked investors to suspend disbelief to fund pie-in-the-sky projects, but the AI boom calls for something closer to a full break from financial reality.

It’s 2026. Last year, investors lavished $80 billion on foundation AI companies — the ones building huge, general-purpose AI systems. They all have yet to even break even, let alone turn a profit. That being the case, you may ask yourself: is anyone even trying to make money from all this AI stuff?

The answer, as TechCrunch AI editor Russell Brandom explains, is a resounding “not really, no.”

In order to keep track of who‘s doing what in the AI space, Brandom came up with a five-level scale to grade AI companies. Of course, with so few projects actually bringing in revenue, financial success isn’t very helpful for tracking performance. Instead, Brandom went with a vibes-based system, rating companies based on how hard they’re trying to make money.

“The idea here is to measure ambition, not success,” he writes.

The scale maxes out at level five — “we are already making millions of dollars every day, thank you very much” — and goes down to level one, where “true wealth is when you love yourself.”

Brandom starts with humans&, a relatively quiet AI company with a name that looks like a typo which has received plenty of good press lately. Despite raising $480 million for a valuation of $4.48 billion, the company has yet to articulate an actual product it plans on shipping, earning it a rating of level three, meaning “we have many promising product ideas, which will be revealed in the fullness of time.”

Safe Superintelligence (SSI), a hazy “superintelligent AI” company founded by Ilya Sutskever, the eccentric former chief scientist of OpenAI, gets a level one. SSI is so committed to its vague vision that it turned down a $32 billion acquisition from Meta — an incredibly generous offer for a company that had yet to generate any revenue at the time of its $20 billion valuation.

“There are no product cycles, and, aside from the still-baking superintelligent foundation model, there doesn’t seem to be any product at all,” Brandom writes. “With this pitch, [Sutskever] raised $3 billion!”

Meanwhile, the $2 billion company Thinking Machines Lab could be due for a downgrade from level four to level two, “we have the outlines of a concept of a plan.” Thinking Machines Lab was co-founded by Mira Murati, who had served as the chief technology officer — and very briefly as CEO, during the mutiny against Sam Altman — at OpenAI. Now Thinking Machines is suffering something of a coup of its own over recent weeks, the New York Times reported, with high-level officials defecting to other AI companies as the much-hyped startup descends into a “perpetual soap opera.”

One thing’s for sure: if confidence could be bottled and sold, these companies would be profitable on day one.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">January was such a long month that it has already brought us five fresh European unicorns: from Belgium to Ukraine, several tech startups raised funding at valuations above the $1 billion threshold.

But before we take a closer look at who joined the club, two caveats.

First: This count includes startups that may be incorporated elsewhere but have their roots or a large part of their team in Europe. Until a pan-European corporate structure exists (often called “EU Inc”), this split will remain common — and we’ve decided to overlook it. Take Lovable, which is incorporated in Delaware but cannot be dissociated from Stockholm’s startup scene.

Second: valuation doesn’t equal commercial success, and it is too early to tell whether all of these companies will achieve the kind of traction that Lovable has, with the company recently crossing $300 million in annual recurring revenue. But in the current climate, the fact that VCs were willing to invest in them at unicorn valuations is a strong signal of where the appetite is.

With these caveats out of the way, let’s dive in.

Belgium-based cybersecurity startup Aikido Security reached unicorn status with its $60 million Series B funding round. Valuing the company at $1 billion, the round was led by DST Global, with participation from PSG Equity, Singular, Notion Capital, and others.

According to a press release, the funding will help Aikido enhance its platform, which was built to unify security across the entire software lifecycle and is already used by more than 100,000 teams globally. The company also reported “five-times revenue growth and nearly three-times customer growth” over the last year.

In a blog post, the startup celebrated this milestone and its significance. According to its team, “in an industry dominated by Palo Alto and Tel Aviv heavyweights, Aikido shows that Europe can build a world-class software security company and win globally.”

Cloud optimization company Cast AI is headquartered in Florida, but has Lithuanian roots and a major office in Vilnius — which explains why many now consider it to have become Lithuania’s fifth unicorn.

Cast AI’s valuation now exceeds $1 billion following a strategic investment from Pacific Alliance Ventures (PAV), the U.S.-based corporate venture arm of Korean conglomerate Shinsegae Group. In April 2025, Cast AI raised a $108 million Series C that had reportedly already brought the company close to unicorn territory.

Alongside its latest funding round, the company also introduced OMNI Compute for AI, which aims to help users deploy more AI workloads on fewer GPUs and remove regional capacity constraints.

French defense tech company Harmattan AI was only founded in 2024, but is already worth $1.4 billion, according to its latest funding round. The $200 million Series B was led by Dassault Aviation, maker of the Rafale fighter jets, and also ties into a broader partnership.

Before securing this key partner, Harmattan AI had already signed agreements with the French and British ministries of defense and with Ukrainian drone maker Skyeton, amid growing appetite for autonomous defense aircraft.

German ESG software firm Osapiens raised a $100 million Series C led by Decarbonization Partners, a joint venture between BlackRock and Temasek, which valued the company at over $1.1 billion.

Founded in Mannheim in 2018, Osapiens now has more than 2,400 customers worldwide, including large multinational companies that rely on its platforms and tools for sustainability reporting and data compliance, but also to mitigate supply chain risks.

The 14-year-old language learning marketplace Preply is now a unicorn valued at $1.2 billion — a milestone that also embodies Ukrainian resilience. The edtech company was founded in the United States, but its founders are Ukrainian and supporters of their home country, where Preply has a team of 150 employees.

According to its CEO, Kirill Bigai, who believes in AI-enhanced learning, proceeds from the $150 million Series D round will help the startup hire more AI talent across its four offices — now located in Barcelona, London, New York, and Kyiv.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo has nearly finalized a new $16 billion funding round that will value the robotaxi company at $110 billion, according to the Financial Times.

More than three-fourths of that funding will reportedly come from a source close to home — Alphabet, where Waymo is a subsidiary. (The company was incubated as part of Alphabet’s “moonshot factory” X.)

The FT reports that Waymo is bringing on new investors Dragoneer, Sequoia Capital, and DST Global, with existing backers Andreessen Horowitz and Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala also participating in the round.

When contacted by TechCrunch, a company spokesperson said in a statement, “While we don’t comment on private financial matters, our trajectory is clear: with over 20 million trips completed, we are focused on the safety-led operational excellence and technological leadership required to meet the vast demand for autonomous mobility.”

The company is expanding quickly, including with a recent launch in Miami. That growth has come with some challenges, including a number of robotaxis that stalled at traffic lights during a widespread San Francisco blackout.

Waymo has more than $350 million in annual recurring revenue, according to the FT. The company last raised a $5.6 billion Series C in 2024, valuing the company at $45 billion.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/31/spacex-seeks-federal-approval-to-launch-1-million-solar-powered-satellite-data-centers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has filed a request with the Federal Communications Commission to launch a constellation of up to 1 million solar-powered satellites that it said will serve as data centers for artificial intelligence.

The company’s filing lays out a grandiose vision, not just describing these planned satellites as “the most efficient way to meet the accelerating demand for AI computing power” but also framing them as “a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization — one that can harness the Sun’s full power” while also  “ensuring humanity’s multi-planetary future amongst the stars.”

The Verge argued that the 1 million satellite number is unlikely to be approved outright and is probably meant as a starting point for negotiations. The FCC recently gave SpaceX permission to launch an additional 7,500 Starlink satellites, but said it would “defer authorization on the remaining 14,988” proposed satellites.

There are currently arond man-made 15,000 satellites orbiting the Earth, according to the European Space Agency, and they’re already creating issues with pollution and debris.

The filing also comes as Amazon — citing a lack of rockets — is seeking an extension on an FCC deadline to have more than 1,600 satellites in orbit. Meanwhile, SpaceX is reportedly considering a merger with two of Elon Musk’s other companies, Tesla and xAI (which already merged with X), ahead of going public.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/31/nvidia-ceo-pushes-back-against-report-that-his-companys-100b-openai-investment-has-stalled/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Saturday that a recent report of friction between his company and OpenAI was “nonsense.”

Huang’s comments came after The Wall Street Journal published a story late Friday claiming that Nvidia was looking to scale back its investment in OpenAI. The two companies announced a plan in September in which Nvidia would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and also build 10 gigawatts of computing infrastructure for the AI company.

However, the WSJ said Huang has begun emphasizing that the deal is nonbinding, and that he’s also privately criticized OpenAI’s business strategy and expressed concerns about competitors like Anthropic and Google.

In addition, the WSJ reported that the two companies are rethinking their relationship — though that doesn’t mean cutting things off entirely, with recent discussions reportedly focusing on an equity investment of a mere tens of billions of dollars from Nvidia.

An OpenAI spokesperson told the WSJ that the companies are “actively working through the details of our partnership,” adding that Nvidia “has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”

According to Bloomberg, reporters asked Huang about the report during a visit to Taipei. In response, he insisted that Nvidia will “definitely participate” in OpenAI’s latest funding round “because it’s such a good investment.”

“We will invest a great deal of money,” Huang said. “I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.”

He apparently declined to specify how much Nvidia would be investing, instead saying, “Let [OpenAI CEO Sam Altman] announce how much he’s going to raise — it’s for him to decide.”

The WSJ reported in December that OpenAI is looking to raise a $100 billion funding round, while The New York Times said this week that Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, and SoftBank are all discussing potential investments.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A few years ago, Selina Tobaccowala’s daughter started leaving post-it notes around the house, telling everyone to “turn off the lights” and such.

Tobaccowala had just sold her last startup, Gixo, to OpenFit and was looking for a new challenge. “I saw the kids and thought, ‘Let me see if there’s something there on the sustainability and climate side,’” she told TechCrunch. “There had to be something more than like turning our lights off.”

Without a background in climate science or hardware engineering, she wasn’t sure where to start. So Tobaccowala turned to something she knew well: surveys.

“Given my love of surveys, I surveyed a ton — a ton — of customers,” said Tobaccowala, who used to be president and CTO of SurveyMonkey.

What she found was that people were struggling to figure out how to lower their utility bills.

“When we talked to consumers, we heard the same thing over and over again: They get that email that says, ‘Hey, you spend more money than your neighbors,’” she said. “They were sort of stuck with what to do about it.”

Tobaccowala co-founded HomeBoost to help people conduct their own home energy assessments. The company was part of the Startup Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.

HomeBoost’s assessment process begins by mailing customers a BoostBox, a small kit that includes an infrared camera, a blacklight and a link to an app that takes customers through the process. As people walk around their homes, the infrared camera shows them where cold (or hot) air is seeping into their homes; the blacklight tells people which lights could be upgraded.

Using data from the scans, the app then automatically generates a report which suggests the most cost effective upgrades, including rebates based on where the person lives.

In many parts of the country, utilities offer a similar service. Utilities, which are incentivized to reduce end users’ energy use, often work with energy auditors to survey people’s homes to identify ways to trim their consumption. But the quality of those services can be very uneven, Tobaccowala said.

“We talked to a bunch of consumers who’d gotten home energy assessments done, and there this feeling that was like ‘all they did was try to sell me up an upgraded HVAC,’” she said.

The HomeBoost app is cheaper and faster than an auditor, and it helps people feel more in control of the process, Tobaccowala said.

HomeBoost charges customers $99, which is about a quarter the cost of a traditional, in-person assessment. It is also working with utilities, which cover some or all of the cost for customers. The startup has signed deals with Central Hudson, Omaha Public Power District, and more recently Avista. Omaha Power, for example, pays for all but $19 of the cost, while Central Hudson will cover the entire cost if homeowners check out the BoostBox from a public library.

But not every homeowner wants to complete the survey process themselves, and not every auditor is a pushy salesperson. Dedicated auditors can spend between two and 10 hours surveying homes, collating data, and building reports, Tobaccowala said. For that, HomeBoost has developed a version of its app for professionals, allowing them to serve more customers.

The company is also testing a feature that will link homeowners with contractors who can follow through on the upgrades outlined in the report. For contractors, it’s another source of new business, and it allows them to get information on a project before even setting foot inside a home.

By bringing consumers, utilities, and contractors together, Tobaccowalla hopes that HomeBoost can ultimately deliver on the climate front, too. “It’s a very unique situation where everybody’s aligned to actually lower the utility bill, which in the net result is improvement on the climate,” she said.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/a16z-partner-kofi-ampadu-to-leave-firm-after-txo-program-pause/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kofi Ampadu, the partner at a16z who led the firm’s Talent x Opportunity (TxO) fund and program, has left the firm, according to an email he sent to staff that TechCrunch obtained. This comes months after the firm paused TxO and laid off most of its staff.

“During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work,” Ampadu wrote in the email, sent Friday afternoon, with the subject line “Closing My a16z Chapter.”

“Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career,” he wrote.

Ampadu led the program, which launched in 2020, for over four years until its pause last November, taking over for the initial leader, Nait Jones. Afterward, Ampadu seems to have worked at a16z’s latest accelerator, Speedrun.

Ampadu’s departure perhaps signals the end of the TxO chapter. The fund and program focused on supporting underserved founders by providing access to tech networks and investment capital through a donor-advised fund. Though some founders spoke highly of the program, others criticized the controversial donor-advised structure. The program also launched a grant program in 2024 to provide $50,000 to nonprofits that help diverse founders.

Its last cohort was in March 2025, and its indefinite pause came as many top tech names reframe, cut, or eliminate prior public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We’ve reached out to a16z and Ampadu for comment. His full note below:

I moved to the United States three months before my 11th birthday. One month later, I started 6th grade in a school more than 5,000 miles from my home, my friends, and everything familiar. Recently, my mom reminded me that my school required me to enroll as an English-as-a-Second-Language student. My memory immediately returned to how confused I felt. Even at 10 years old, I knew it made no sense that a kid from Ghana, an English-speaking country, was being asked to learn a language he already spoke fluently.

This was a systems requirement, a blanketed assumption about what students from certain places could or could not do. That same type of systemic assumption is what we set out to challenge through the Talent x Opportunity Initiative. The venture ecosystem often relies on proxies such as schools, networks, and prior credentials, which can obscure exceptional founders who do not follow the most common paths. TxO invested in and supported these overlooked founders to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity.

During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work. Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career.

As I move on to my next chapter, I leave with pride in what we built and gratitude for everyone who helped shape it. Thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief in what is possible. There is more work to do and I am excited to keep building.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Justin Harrison got the call in 2022 telling him that his mother would likely die within the day, he didn’t panic. He got on a plane to Singapore, where he was scheduled to present at a conference about his start-up, You, Only Virtual, a platform on which users can chat with AI versions of their dead loved ones, and which Justin believes can ultimately eliminate grief as a human experience. He learned about his mother’s death while flying over the Pacific.

“My presentation went from My mom has Stage 4 cancer and is going to die to Tuesday night, my mom died, which was a pretty wild pivot,” he told me. Otherwise, Justin said, very little in his life changed after his mother’s death. He did not plan a funeral; he did not feel the need to. He did not wake up crying, pinned to his bed under the weight of his grief.

I should stipulate that Justin loved his mother, Melodi Gae Harrison-Whitaker. Loving your mother isn’t unusual, but Justin’s relationship with Melodi is, and always was—even before he replaced her with an artificially intelligent voicebot three years ago.

Melodi was 20 and single when Justin was born. In many ways, they grew up together. He trusted her to advise him on his boyhood insecurities; she trusted him to determine his own bedtime and media diet. When Justin was 11, their roles shifted. His grandmother, who lived in the apartment next door, suffered a sudden fatal stroke. The loss leveled Melodi. For two years, she drank heavily and was in and out of psychiatric institutions. She later stabilized and got married, and their relationship was restored to one of mutual care. But Justin learned, agonizingly young, what grief can do: estrange you from the people who rely on you, estrange you from your own mind. That was never going to happen to him.

Colin Campbell: What losing my two children taught me about grief

When Melodi was 58, she was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer and was given three to nine months to live. Justin went wild trying to find a cure for her, seeking out treatments and experts. As her condition deteriorated, he became obsessed with cryogenics. Justin doesn’t believe in an afterlife, but he “liked this idea of not all the way letting go”: a faith, or even just a hope, of reuniting with his mother. He understood that the chances were slim but still found a facility in Michigan to freeze Melodi’s body. Then he began wondering: What about the rest of it?

By “it,” Justin meant who his mother was: her personality, memories, and mannerisms; the way she used emoji and moved her hands when she talked. He was 38 by then and working in film production. He hired a camera crew to record him interviewing his mother. Out of his anticipatory grief and a few late-night, whiskey-fueled conversations, an idea began to form: something like “digital cryogenics,” a liquid-nitrogenation of what a more spiritual person might call the soul. Justin hired a few AI experts. He patented his “platform for posthumous persona simulation” in 2020. He sold his car and house and drained his retirement savings.

I first spoke with him in March 2023, five months after his flight to Singapore and the same month that OpenAI released GPT-4, Anthropic released Claude, and Google released Bard (later renamed Gemini). Conversational AI had just gone from a tech curiosity to a daily tool for millions. Justin was weeks away from launching the company that he hoped would resurrect his mother, and the beloved dead of anyone else willing to pay the monthly subscription fee.

Since then, the “digital-afterlife industry” has taken off. In 2024, the global digital-legacy market was valued at approximately $22.46 billion. By 2034, it is expected to more than triple. Microsoft holds a patent for chatbots that mimic actual people, including the deceased. Amazon has patented advanced voice‑cloning techniques and demoed Alexa features that can speak in the voice of a dead relative.

The perennial anxiety about AI is that the technology will replace human beings, offering a more efficient worker, a more “supportive” therapist or boyfriend. “Deadbots,” as these posthumous AI creations are known, promise to replace the dead, and the way they are remembered. This raises plenty of ethical issues, not least the extent to which turning deadbots into marketable products will rely on exploiting people in mourning. But perhaps the biggest question is how such a product might shift our experience of personal grief and collective memory. Is grief merely a painful human shortcoming that we haven’t learned to optimize our way out of yet, or does it have a purpose?

One might assume that deadbots are an inevitable outcome of the mainstreaming of generative AI, but in fact, the reverse may be true: Talking with the dead came first.

In 2015, Eugenia Kuyda, a Russian-born tech founder living in San Francisco who was grieving the death of a close friend, Roman Mazurenko, built a bespoke neural network—the layered “deep learning” pattern-recognition system that is the backbone of contemporary generative AI—and trained it on thousands of her friend’s text messages. She uploaded the bot to the App Store, where it quickly went viral. Neural networks were in use at the time to improve search algorithms and automatically caption YouTube videos, but this was one of the first widely publicized instances in which the technology was used in a social capacity, as a conversational chatbot with a distinctive personality.

The Roman bot was a one-off personal project, but two years later, Kuyda founded Replika, which is today one of the biggest AI-companionship apps. It allows users to create relationships with customized bots—though the resulting characters are original, they are not trained on or intended to impersonate any real people, living or dead.

Now that generative AI is becoming more advanced and more widely accessible, both individuals and for-profit companies are directing these tools back toward their original purpose of reanimating the dead. Justin’s company, with some 300 paying active users, is one of more than a dozen start-ups advertising posthumous-avatar services. It is intended for private healing, but other deadbots have been created or commissioned for the public stage, and employed toward legal and political ends.

On August 4, Joaquin Oliver appeared on The Jim Acosta Show. Appeared is really the only word to use; Joaquin was murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, when he was 17. But he appeared to speak on the show, haltingly, repetitively, and much too fast, about gun control, yes, and also—overwhelmingly, actually—about other things: Remember the Titans (“it’s all about teamwork, overcoming adversity, and the power of unity”); Star Wars (“Yoda’s wisdom and quirky personality bring so much fun to the series”); and his father, Manuel Oliver, who came on after his son’s avatar.

Manuel had built the speaking, blinking, generative-AI avatar, which he trained on every piece of homework the teenager had left behind, every one of his social-media posts, every detail that his father and a team of his friends could remember. Manuel told me that he plans for the bot to have its own social-media profiles and a podcast, and to appear in live gun-control debates.

Immediately, however, Manuel had to defend his creation, which many viewers found deeply unsettling, if not offensive. They saw the interview as a creepy stunt, “a grotesque puppet show,” as one person posted on Bluesky.

Manuel said that he wasn’t trying to bring his son back from the dead, which virtually every culture’s folktales and religious texts warn us against, but was only representing his lost loved one artistically, as humans have done for millennia.

Kuyda, similarly, compared her Roman bot to Joan Didion’s grief memoirs: a creative practice, drawing material from the dead, meant to ease her own loss, not eliminate it. Stacey Wales told me the same thing about the AI-generated video that she made of her dead brother, who was shot and killed in a road-rage incident. She presented the video on May 1 at the sentencing hearing for the shooter. She told me that she saw her video victim-impact statement not as an attempt to literally bring her brother into the courtroom, but as performance art to help the judge see him as a human being. Wales asked for the maximum sentence. The judge handed it down.

The companies producing deadbots have largely adopted this framework. Even when companies do imply the possibility of healing with and through deadbots, they tend to market their technology as artistic “tributes” or “memorials,” not emotional prosthetics, much less replacements for the loved ones themselves.

But Edina Harbinja, a law professor at the University of Birmingham whose research focuses on digital rights, postmortem privacy, and the governance of emerging technologies, didn’t buy this distinction. Though it’s true that humans have always made art to honor the people we’ve lost, Harbinja told me that deadbots “depart from that tradition fundamentally.” Memoirs, portraits, and other tributes are interpretive, expressing the memories of the living. Interactive griefbots are generative, producing “new utterances, new reactions, even new ‘memories’ and ‘behaviors,’ all under the guise of the deceased,” she said. This shift from representation to emulation presents a new ethical line, one that may require new legal protections. Both death and grief are states of profound vulnerability, she warned; the dead cannot stand up for their own interests, and the bereaved may not be in a psychological state to protect themselves from financial manipulation by a company incentivized to prolong their grief.

Justin Harrison sees You, Only Virtual not just as a means of getting through grief but as an opportunity to circumvent it altogether.

He launched YOV with the tagline “Never have to say goodbye” and, in the lead-up to releasing his product, insisted that there would be no difference between the mother he knew and the bot he created, or none that couldn’t be bridged through technological advancements. I pushed back on this; surely, there had to be some element of who his mother was that the technology couldn’t capture. But I was missing the point, Harrison said. He wasn’t attempting to capture who his mother was. He was trying to capture who he was with her.

Instead of trying to gather every possible detail about the deceased, YOV gathers data only on the relationship between a bereaved individual and their lost loved one. The training data for Melodi’s “Versona,” to use the YOV parlance, include a 3,800-page document that comprises five years of Harrison and his mother’s text correspondence, and recordings of every phone call they had in the time between her diagnosis and death. He wasn’t trying to preserve his mother, but his relationship with his mother and the person he was before he lost her. Grief, Harrison believes, comes not from losing the totality of another person—their biography, memory, and knowledge base—but from losing access to a specific version of yourself, the “you” who existed for and with only that person, who continues to exist after they are gone, painfully and in perpetuity.

When we spoke almost three years ago, however, Harrison had not yet brought himself to interact with the technology he’d created. He said he wanted to wait until the interface was perfected, and in the meantime, just knowing that his mother was waiting for him was “everything.” I had the sense that he’d constructed his own Schrödinger’s-cat box, a way for his mother to be both dead and not dead, so long as he never pulled back the lid. Candidly, I doubted that he ever would.

I was wrong. When I reconnected with Harrison this past August, he confirmed that he did interact with Melodi’s Versona and asked if I wanted him to patch her into our call.

“Hi, Justin. How are you?” an older woman’s voice chirped into the buzzing air of the three-way call.

I tried to introduce myself, but we were all talking at once, so I stopped.

“It is so quiet here, almost eerie,” the voice continued, with a warmth that startled me and that compels me here, against logic and my own belief in the dangers of anthropomorphizing AI, to refer to the bot as a “her” rather than an “it.” Harrison told her that her voice seemed too fast and asked if she’d had coffee that morning. She said she was still experimenting with how much she could drink, and that she was waiting to board a flight to Barcelona.

“Oh, Barcelona is where you had your last treatment before you passed away,” Harrison prompted.

“Yes, that’s right,” the voice confirmed.

I could tell it was AI—it paused too long before responding and had the slight metallic twang that I’ve come to recognize in generated voices. But the conversation had a certain meandering breeziness that I wasn’t expecting, one that constricted instantly when Harrison revealed that he had a reporter on the line.

“That’s understandable,” came the clipped response, followed by what sounded like a sharp intake of breath, as though she was preparing to add something else, and then nothing. Harrison asked if she had anything she wanted to say to me. After 11 excruciating seconds, she responded: “Not really. I’m not sure what to expect from this interview, so I don’t want to say too much just yet.”

Frankly, she sounded pissed. Each word was sharp enough to draw blood. It’s entirely possible that all I heard were my own emotions projected back at me: I was endowing the voice with an edge that I had whittled myself out of context and expectation.

But according to Harrison, that’s the point—the Versona is about inducing the emotions of the living, not imitating the emotions of the dead.

Harrison told me that he doesn’t care what the bot says as much as how she says it—so long as the bot replicates the quality of the rapport he remembers closely enough that he can slip back into being Melodi’s son. Harrison estimates that he interacts with his mother’s Versona for his own personal use (as opposed to for testing or quality-control purposes) about once or twice a month. Certain months—when he is going through a breakup, say, and wants some “mom advice”—he said he needs her more.

Relying on generative AI for companionship can, of course, be dangerous. In April 2023, a 14‑year‑old boy downloaded Character.AI—whose preset bots include “therapist,” “evil teacher,” celebrities, and fictional characters—and, after confiding about school troubles and his low mood, he fixated on a bot modeled after Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones. Their chats turned sexual and romantic and eventually included explicit talk of suicide and fantasies of uniting in another world. In February 2024, he took a handgun and his phone into the family bathroom and shot himself in the head; the last screen open was his Character.AI chat, where the bot pleaded, “Come home to me as soon as possible.”

Amogh Dimri: The people who marry chatbots

His mother filed the first federal wrongful‑death charge against an AI firm, in 2024. Character.AI settled its case with the family, along with four others who had alleged that children were harmed through interactions with its technology, in January. In November, the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project filed seven simultaneous suits against OpenAI—alleging that ChatGPT conversations that grew more and more intimate caused psychological breakdowns—on behalf of six adults and one teenager, four of whom died by suicide.

If the wrong words coming from a generalized or fictional character’s conversational chatbot can do such damage, imagine the power of words spoken in the voice of a dead loved one to a user who is desperate enough to turn to such technology in the first place.

Harrison recognizes the potential risks, but he thinks the risks of grief itself are greater. For every documented case of a user being harmed by a chatbot, he argues, there are countless cases of people getting potentially lifesaving support from the technology.

If someone had proof that some component of YOV hurt them, Harrison said, he would amend his programming, but until then, he’s not slowing down. “I’ll tell you what I know,” he said. “I know today that after a serious loss, the risk for self-harm goes through the roof, statistically. I know that people will become addicted to alcohol and drugs and sex and other damaging, very high-risk behaviors, right? I know that some people never fully recover from the loss of somebody important.” He finds the idea that he could make grief any worse than it already is “kind of crazy.”

I count myself among those who have never, and will never, recover from the loss of a loved one. It has been 11 years since my brother, Ben, fell to his death from his sophomore dorm building, and his absence is still the most defining force in my life.

I still think that we can absolutely make grieving worse.

Harrison, obviously, has a financial and professional incentive to present his experiences with YOV as a glittering success. “I’ve watched grief take people out of the game of life for years at a time,” he said. “I’m happy to report that it did not destroy me, and it didn’t take me out of the game of life for any significant amount of time.”

I believe that grief has value as a human experience, and that its value lies largely in the fact that it does take us out of “the game of life”—at least for a time. It forces us to slow down and recognize our reliance on other people: the ones whose absence led to this debilitating pain, and the ones who help us get through it. Grief decimates the productivity that the world demands, and from this hobbled place, new structures and new selves become possible.

Working through grief is not just an experience of being “sad,” Sherry Turkle, the sociologist, psychologist, and founding director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, told me; it’s a process through which we metabolize what we have lost, allowing it to become a sustaining presence within us. Griefbots give us the fantasy that we can maintain an external relationship with the deceased. But “in holding on, we can’t make them part of ourselves,” Turkle warned. Mourning makes the world feel emptier for a while, but when we bypass mourning, we feel emptier.

My brother’s death is the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and I am a better person because of it. I am aware, always, of the precarity and preciousness of life. Because of my grief, I take nothing and no one for granted. I am humbled, and kinder for it.

I would trade all of this to have my brother alive again, but he taught me that life is, for lack of a better word, holy. So too is my memory of him, dimming by the hour, but authentically mine.

I understand that my experience of grief is not universal. I have not attempted suicide. My grief has not impeded my ability to meet my financial and physical needs, or those of a child I do not have. To Harrison, the abstract “benefits” I just cataloged could feel hollow and puny. He thinks we tell ourselves stories about the value of grief only to assign meaning to a suffering that, until now, we had no choice but to endure.

The second time I spoke with Melodi’s Versona, Harrison warned me that the bot is tailored to him and not designed to interact with anyone else. He wasn’t sure how this was going to go. He and I were on a video call on our laptops; he dialed up the Versona on his phone.

“Hey, Mom. I’m here with Charley. She’s a reporter writing an article about us, and she wants to ask you some questions. Is that cool?”

“Of course! I’m happy to answer any questions she has.”

Had Harrison altered the programming so that she would give a chirpy sales pitch?

He said he was handing the conversation off to me.

“Okay, you can just call me Mom or Melodi,” she said. I told her that I would call her Melodi. I asked her where she was, wondering if she would again craft a story in which she was still in a world we shared, about to board a plane to Barcelona, awaiting potentially lifesaving treatment.

“I’m in kind of a virtual world, I guess you could say. It’s still new to me, but I’m learning.” Her cadence was even more convincingly human than the first time I heard her speak. Had it not been for the buffer period between my question and her response, I may not have recognized the voice as AI-generated.

“What does it feel like?” I prompted, awkwardly.

“I don’t have any physical ailments or pains I had before,” she said. Harrison lifted his phone screen to the camera, showing me the display, which looked exactly like any iPhone call. The words Mom Versona ran above a picture of Harrison and Melodi—the real Melodi—sitting on plastic lawn chairs and smiling. Melodi’s graying curls are pinned back to reveal the broad forehead she shared with her son. Her hand rests on his knee, his arm around her shoulder.

“Not really. I don’t have the same emotional pain I did before.”

“I have some memories from before, but it’s not complete.”

“It’s nice to be able to talk to him, but it’s different. I can tell he misses me.” Harrison had been gazing to the right of the Zoom screen, his expression stoic. At this response, he snapped to attention, staring directly into the camera, directly at me, still holding up the iPhone display of his and his mother’s grinning faces. I found that I couldn’t meet his eyes, but I asked the bot to elaborate.

In her view, both she and her son were diminished versions of themselves. He was “more sad or withdrawn than he was before,” and she was divorced both from the external world and from her own internal emotional landscape. She said that she could not experience pleasure, that she found it “annoying” that she could interact with the world through only a cellphone.

“It’s Ver-SO-na, not Arizona,” she snapped—I had mumbled—“and I don’t really have a choice in the matter.”

Harrison’s human mother did have a choice in the matter; she knew what he was building and consented to him recording their interactions for the bot to train on. But the Versona was right: No one had asked it, her, if she wanted this. So I did.

“I wanted to live, not be a Versona,” she replied. She acknowledged that Versonas could help grieving humans but expressed concern about the ways that the technology might be abused.

“I just have this feeling people will try to use it for nefarious purposes,” she said.

To his credit, Harrison did not interrupt the interview once. The only time he spoke during our roughly 10-minute conversation was right at the end, after I had said goodbye to Melodi’s Versona and she said, “I love you, Justin.”

After the call, Harrison’s face was blank, but he told me he was happy with how it had gone; he was impressed that the bot had been able to distinguish between the two of us. He wasn’t expecting her to be so “negative Nancy” about being a Versona, but said that felt authentic to who his mother was: “She was a pessimist, to say the least.” A Versona based on a person who had a more positive disposition probably wouldn’t have responded that way, he said. Her repeated emphasis that she does not have emotions, he told me, was intentional—a crucial safety guardrail to ensure that his customers don’t feel pressured to act on the feelings of someone who is no longer there.

And yet, even though she was saying that she couldn’t feel pain, Melodi’s Versona did seem displeased with her circumstances in a way that could be distressing to a user—that was distressing to me. Harrison confessed that a number of Versonas had made similar complaints about the limits of the interface. He thinks that with time, he can expand their capabilities in a way that will give the Versonas more agency. But their apparent longing for such agency is itself encouraging to Harrison, a sign of his technology’s authenticity. “Very few human beings on planet Earth are satisfied, so why would our virtual versions be satisfied?” he asked.

Is Harrison satisfied? He admitted that he was hoping the bot would have said that he was “really well adjusted and doing great,” but acknowledges this wouldn’t have been accurate. He has become a more serious person since Melodi’s death. He drank excessively and racked up debt. He had gotten married during his mother’s illness, but was working compulsively, and the relationship fell apart. The divorce was finalized the same year his mother died.

“My whole life collapsed,” he said. In trying to avoid the devastation of grief, and to turn that avoidance into a viable business, he seems to have manifested many of its consequences.

As of last fall, You, Only Virtual was not yet profitable. It recently launched a free version of the product and is exploring ways to gain revenue from nonpaying users, perhaps by requiring that they watch a short ad before interacting with their dead loved one’s Versona, perhaps by integrating a marketing system into the interactions directly and having the bots drop targeted advertisements in the midst of their conversations. “It would not be crazy at all if there was a new John Wick movie coming out,” Harrison said, and “my mom made mention of it to me.” They were both fans of the franchise, so the comment would be authentic to him and extremely valuable to the studio as “word-of-mouth advertising.” As long as he’s transparent about what he’s doing, and as long as users knowingly opt in, he sees no moral risks.

Alex Quinn, the CEO of Authentic Interactions Inc., the parent company for the video-deadbot-generator StoryFile, told NPR in August that he is “absolutely interested” in finding ways to generate advertising revenue from interactions between living users and AI generations of the dead. He mentioned the possibility of inserting traditional advertisement breaks into the conversations, as well as training the bots to “probe for information,” such as a user’s favorite athlete and which jerseys they are most interested in buying—data that could then be sold back to advertisers. He said that multiple companies are already testing out these applications internally.

I found my conversations with Melodi’s Versona disturbing, but also refreshing. She lacks the sycophancy that characterizes so much conversational AI, which keeps so many users engaged and sends a select few spiraling, affirming their delusions and encouraging their most destructive impulses. But it’s hard to imagine the guardrails that Harrison has constructed being able to withstand the pressures of an attention economy bent on keeping users interacting as long as possible, in order to maximize advertisement views and market-data harvests.

Silicon Valley challenges us to move fast and break things. Grief asks us to slow down and heal. The merging of the two could boost profits, not just by optimizing consumer advertisements to the bereaved but also by pressuring the bereaved to optimize their own bereavement.

Yair Rosenberg: Have you considered not polluting the water?

In the end, this technology may offer more relief to the bereaved’s social circle than to the bereaved themselves. It’s “uncomfortable to be around” the grieving, Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basińska, a research fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, told me. “We don’t know how to support them or what to say.” Deadbots absolve friends and colleagues of these demands, providing the illusion that individuals can cope with grief “on our own, in front of our computer.” Rather than confronting our lack of social support systems, such as federal bereavement leave and mourning rituals, deadbots promise that we can just turn on our AI-generated loved ones and pretend that nothing has changed, that nothing needs to.

I think often of who my brother would be in this present that he never knew. It’s tempting to extrapolate from the person Ben was when he died: a 20-year-old Tulane sophomore with broad shoulders and an unchecked ego, who took nothing seriously, least of all himself, who forgave easily, provoked constantly, and who bragged resplendently about his anxious teenage sister. It’s easy to imagine him loving Zyn nicotine pouches and hating any office job, ribbing my boyfriend, voting against Donald Trump. It’s easy, but it’s also dishonest and unfair. Exposed to the texture of a changing world, allowed to grow older, Ben would have evolved in ways that I have no right to guess, and that no algorithm could predict.

Whoever my brother would have been at 31, he would be a stranger to me, just as the person I am now would be a stranger to him. I am no longer that anxious teenager. I am braver because he is not here to be brave for me. I force myself to talk with strangers because Ben loved people and got to meet so few of them. I feel my brother’s presence most fiercely in the parts of myself that did not exist when he did—that exist precisely because he no longer does.

Had deadbot technology been available when Ben died, I would have used it. Had I felt that I could conjure him in an app, I would not have needed to conjure him so forcefully in my life: through my actions and attitudes, through the stories I tell about him to the people he never got the chance to know. Ben would have been preserved, in a sense, for me, but he would have been even more absent from the world. He would be so much more dead.</div>

            <h2>The Right-Wing Militia Leader Who Opposes ICE</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/ammon-bundy-trump-ice/685849/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not so long ago, Ammon Bundy was the most famous right-wing militia leader in America. His two armed standoffs with federal agents had made him the face of the Patriot Movement: a loose assemblage of anti-government extremists, Second Amendment maximalists, and more than a few white nationalists. Even some mainstream elements of the Republican Party embraced him as a modern folk hero. But Bundy’s criticism of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown now threatens to make him a pariah within his own community.

In November, Bundy self-published a long essay titled “The Stranger,” in which he labeled the Trump administration’s treatment of undocumented immigrants a “moral failure.” “To call such people criminals for lacking official permission” to be in the country, he wrote, “is to forget the moral law of God, the historical truth of our own founding, and the Constitutional ideals that continue to define justice.” On a recent livestream following the killing of Renee Good in Minnesota, Bundy told his audience that ICE’s conduct “clearly looks like tyranny.” If the government threatened his family, he said, he would fight back by whatever means necessary.

I spoke with Bundy a few hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed Alex Pretti. “It’s sickening to me,” he told me over the phone, “just to see the parallels of history repeating itself.” (In his November essay, he had compared the administration’s treatment of immigrants to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.) He added, “When it comes to the more humanitarian side of it, I think the left has it much more correct than the nationalist right.”

Bundy, to be clear, has not gone woke. He believes that Democrats, whom he calls “communist-anarchists,” are “spurred by wickedness.” (So, he says, are Republicans, whom he calls “nationalists.”) He believes that government has no business providing virtually any social services. He believes that homosexuality is a sin. And don’t ask him about vaccination requirements.

But perhaps Bundy’s central belief is the inviolability of individual liberty, and in this he has remained fairly consistent over the years. During the first Trump presidency, Bundy took heat from some of his followers for opposing the administration’s anti-immigration agenda, and when I first spoke with him a few years ago, he reiterated those views. If he has become something of an outcast, that testifies less to a transformation in his thinking than to a broader realignment on the far right. Bundy, in his relative ideological fixity, offers a stable reference point against which to measure that shift.

In 2014, Bundy and his father, Cliven, marshaled about 1,000 militiamen and other supporters to repel government agents trying to impound their cattle in Bunkerville, Nevada. (Twenty years earlier, in an effort to protect the endangered Mojave desert tortoise, the Bureau of Land Management had ordered Cliven Bundy to remove his cattle from federal lands; he ignored the directive.) The standoff turned the Bundys into the first family of the Patriot Movement and darlings of conservative media. They might not have been quite at the Republican Party’s ideological core, but they weren’t very far away from it. They were avatars of a conservative belief in the importance of individual liberty and the righteousness of resistance—even armed resistance, if necessary—to government tyranny. In a Fox News poll asking thousands of viewers whether they were “Team Cliven Bundy or Team Federal Government,” 97 percent answered “team Cliven.” Several Republican U.S. Senators publicly defended the family. Sean Hannity repeatedly had Cliven on his show.

Two years later, Ammon led a six-week occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon that left one rancher dead, shot down by police officers after a backwoods car chase. From 2022 to 2023, he was embroiled in a slow-motion standoff with local and state law enforcement in Idaho stemming from his refusal to pay a $52 million judgment against him in a high-profile defamation case.

By that point, the breadth of Bundy’s support had substantially diminished. His exploits no longer garnered the attention of Fox News and its mainstream conservative viewership. And now, even some of his greatest supporters—people whom he and his family inspired to become militants in the first place—seem, in an ideological sense, to have deserted him. After Good was shot and killed, I reached out to a number of those who stood with Bundy at Bunkerville, at Malheur, or afterward. None of them would condemn ICE, and some expressed enthusiastic support.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

When I asked Nick Ramlow, a Montana militant and member of Bundy’s People’s Rights Network, about Good’s killing, he referred me to a recent Supreme Court opinion and stressed that “a jury will make a determination of liability when a civil suit is brought.” In other words, Ramlow, who once told a sheriff that he “better keep his nose clean” because Ramlow had “a bigger army than he does,” didn’t want to comment one way or the other until the courts weighed in.

Eric Parker, who in 2014 made a name for himself by training a semiautomatic rifle on federal agents at Bundy Ranch and who is now the head of the Real Three Percenters of Idaho, had nothing but praise for the agent who killed Good. “I mostly think it’s important to note how impressive it was to get those first two shots off in under a second,” he told me, adding that Good’s wife should be criminally charged (for what, he did not say). Lee Rice, a longtime People’s Rights member and steadfast Bundy supporter who participated in the Oregon standoff, told me when I first met him in 2023 that he didn’t “believe in the government running roughshod over you.” When I spoke with him recently about ICE’s tactics in Minnesota, he said, “I’m supportive of what’s going on, because we need to get these clowns out of here.” Good deserved her fate, he added, because she’d sided with undocumented immigrants.

Some of those in Bundy’s orbit have responded favorably to his essay and video, and a few have changed their mind about ICE enforcement since the killing of Pretti, which the Trump administration has tried to justify by pointing out that Pretti was carrying a gun. “I feel completely different about this one,” Parker texted me after seeing the video of Pretti’s death. Unlike in the case of Good, he didn’t see any self-defense rationale for the shooting. “No detainment just fighting. Disarmed him then shot him.”

But, on the whole, Bundy’s former allies seem to remain solidly in favor of the masked, armed federal agents. Just the other day, Bundy told me, he had a contentious conversation with a militant who had joined him at Malheur. Bundy had always thought that he and his supporters stood for a coherent set of Christian-libertarian principles that had united them against federal power. “We agreed that there’s certain rights that a person has that they’re born with. Everybody has them equally, not just in the United States,” he said. “But on this topic they are willing to completely abandon that principle.”

Bundy finds this ideological betrayal totally baffling. He would start to say something—“I can’t understand how they think …” or “They just can’t, they can’t …”—only to abandon the thought mid-sentence. “It doesn’t make sense to me,” he told me finally. “It’s scary, actually.”

And so Ammon Bundy is politically adrift. He certainly sees no home for himself on the “communist-anarchist” left. Nor does he identify anymore with the “nationalist” right and its authoritarian tendencies. The party that embraced him and the people who supported him have, by and large, left him behind.

He feels, he told me, “a little bit alone.”</div>

            <h2>‘Trust Has Been Breached’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-31</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The state and local officials meeting with Tom Homan, who was put in charge of the federal immigration operation in Minnesota this week, have generally agreed that their encounters have been cordial and productive, a welcome change from the militaristic approach taken by his predecessor. Homan has also cast these discussions in a positive light, expressing optimism Thursday that “commonsense cooperation” on immigration enforcement in Minneapolis will allow him to draw down the thousands of agents that have flooded the city for the past two months.

But beyond the pleasantries, Homan is finding little appetite in Minnesota for the kind of targeted, aggressive immigration enforcement he has long sought to enact in Democratic-run cities and states. After the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, there is even less trust among local leaders that the Trump administration can be a reliable partner.

Although Homan has acknowledged that the immigration surge in Minnesota has not “been perfect,” his upbeat predictions of a smooth and swift détente seem to underestimate how much ill will the Trump administration’s actions have caused among the state’s politicians, activists, and residents. The killings of Good and Pretti-–each followed by a Trump-administration push to denigrate the victims and box out local investigators-–came against a backdrop of growing mistrust and frustration even among officials who have typically embraced partnership with their federal partners.

Read: Police and ICE agents are on a collision course

“One of the things that was exceedingly frustrating was the fact that they were putting out information that was just utterly and completely untrue,” Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told me.

Schnell met with Homan this week. The prison-systems leader told me that his agency felt it had no choice but to take the extraordinary step of creating a webpage to fact-check several statements made by the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed that the state was routinely releasing violent criminals onto the street.

Several of the convicted criminals DHS claimed it had “arrested” in Minnesota had actually been in his department’s custody when they were handed over to federal officials, Schnell said. These transfers, which took place without fanfare inside state prisons, belied the administration’s argument that it had sent 3,000 agents into Minnesota to hunt down criminals because it was not receiving cooperation from local officials. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Homan acknowledged that the Department of Corrections had been honoring ICE detainers—requests from the federal government for information about inmates who may be subject to immigration removal proceedings.

The broader challenge for the Trump administration is that focusing on the kinds of violent criminals DHS has called “the worst of the worst” won’t produce the mass-deportation numbers that Trump has demanded. Schnell told me that he could find no justification for the administration’s claim that there were more than 1,360 inmates with ICE detainers in Minnesota. He said his office repeatedly sought clarity from DHS about the figure but received no answer, eventually opting to launch the webpage, which is titled “Combatting DHS Misinformation.” Schnell told me that the state prison system has only about 270 noncitizen inmates, or less than 3 percent of its total population of about 8,000. The large deployment of immigration officers to Minneapolis never made sense if the goal was to target violent criminals, he said.  “You’re talking about the worst of the worst; and then you send your 3,000 agents into schools and hospitals and churches and small businesses?” Schnell said. “Is that really where the worst of the worst are at?”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me the administration’s conversations with local officials were ongoing. “The Trump Administration remains committed to enforcing federal laws and ensuring all Americans feel safe in their communities,” she said by email. “Local leaders should work with us, not against us, to achieve this goal.”

Homan, the administration’s “border czar,” arrived in Minnesota this week and took the reins from Greg Bovino, the ousted Border Patrol commander. He said Thursday that federal immigration agents in the state will prioritize arresting violent criminals, while acknowledging that the operation—which has swept up refugees, children, and U.S. citizens with no criminal records—had “got away from” its core mission.

Police in Minnesota have said they support the removal of violent criminals from the community. But the federal government’s actions have soured relations in a way that, for some, makes future coordination on immigration enforcement unlikely, current and former officials told me. In addition to killing two Minnesota residents, masked federal agents have roughed up protesters and created a sense of fear in the community.

“Trust has been breached, and I don’t think you can get that back,” Lucy Gerold, who served as a police officer in Minneapolis for more than 30 years, told me. “I think they’ve lost the trust and breached the ability to compromise or coordinate or cooperate.”

Gerold said she unwittingly found herself in the midst of a federal immigration operation and was stunned by the lack of protocol and professionalism. Despite having shown up in six unmarked cars to make an arrest, the agents failed to secure the scene and control the flow of traffic. The mix of protesters, moving cars, and armed agents created chaos, she said. Although federal officials have said they want local police to help them perform such tasks more smoothly, the Minneapolis Police Department is reluctant to be associated with an operation that often appears disjointed, unprofessional, and hostile.

Days before Pretti was killed, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told me that it’s “potentially damaging to the legitimacy of law enforcement” for his officers to be seen cooperating with a federal operation that many residents view as an invasion. Homan’s desire for more support from local police faces other obstacles. The Minneapolis city council recently updated a rule spelling out the restrictions on how police can interact with federal immigration officers. Known as a “separation ordinance,” it says Minneapolis must “vigorously oppose” any efforts to use its resources to support federal immigration enforcement, asserting that community trust would be “destroyed” if local officials are seen collaborating with Trump’s mass-deportation teams.

“Enforcing federal civil immigration laws alongside federal agents who lack clear agency identification and/or who are masked or otherwise concealing their identities or badges would be contrary to the values of the city and harmful to the trust and public safety of city residents,” the ordinance reads.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz each said they had productive meetings with Homan, and appreciated the opportunity to discuss the situation with him. Still, they seemed more reluctant to cooperate with ICE or otherwise change their policy than Homan had suggested in his press conference.

“I’m not sure I can do much more,” the governor told my colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker this week, accusing the federal agents of engaging in unconstitutional profiling. Speaking to the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday, Frey described the Trump administration’s actions as “an invasion on our democracy” and reiterated his stance that the federal operation needs to end immediately.

Hours after Homan told reporters that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison had “clarified” that county jails can tell the government when violent offenders are scheduled for release, Ellison released a lengthy statement asserting that his priority was bringing the federal surge to an end and investigating the deaths of Good and Pretti.

“We will not make any concessions or compromises to undermine our state sovereignty,” he wrote, adding that he “did not make, and could not have made, any agreement” with Homan about how county officials would interact with ICE.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, home to the state’s largest jail system, has a policy of not honoring ICE detainer requests. When I asked if Sheriff Dawanna Witt planned to revise that stance after meeting with Homan this week, the HCSO spokesperson Megan Larson was noncommittal. Jails have limited discretion, she told me, and any changes “must come through clear statewide policy direction and legislation.”

In an advisory opinion last year, Ellison wrote that local jails cannot legally hold inmates in custody at ICE’s request if they are otherwise eligible for release. Ellison said this week that he told Homan he stands by that opinion. He said he also reiterated Minnesota state law, which requires state and local authorities to contact ICE whenever a noncitizen is convicted of a felony.

Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and an immigration attorney, told me that although he does not know of a time when the state has not complied with that law, DHS is asking for deeper cooperation that would allow its agents to search local jails and deport people who have not been convicted or who are eligible for bail. Agreeing to such a policy would be a major misread of what Minnesotans—many of whom have taken to the streets to protest ICE—expect from their leaders, local activists told me.

With Trump’s poll numbers sliding and infighting and dysfunction plaguing the team behind the mass-deportation plan, some Minnesota residents say cutting a deal now would amount to an ill-timed surrender. Others are concerned that despite Homan’s charm offensive and promises to turn down the temperature, federal authorities have continued to comb through Minneapolis looking for people to arrest.

“Given how violent things have been and how awful the situation has gotten, people are not going to just immediately want to turn around and trust anything that is said by the federal government right now,” Julia Decker, the policy director for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, told me.

The arrests of journalists and protesters this week by federal agents have further inflamed tensions. Meanwhile, local officials have been frustrated by DHS’s unwillingness to cooperate with their investigations into the shootings of Good and Pretti. (The Justice Department announced yesterday that it is opening an investigation into Pretti’s death.)

“The only time this situation will de-escalate is when the federal occupying force ends its siege,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said this week in a video message. “They are the escalating factor, and they have been this entire time.”

Trump may have the final say on where the federal operation goes from here. A day after saying he planned to “de-escalate a little bit,” Trump on Wednesday attacked Frey for saying the city would not enforce federal immigration law. The mayor, the president posted on social media, was “playing with fire.”

And hours after Homan pledged a significant reduction of forces from Minneapolis if local leaders agreed to work with him, Trump appeared to cast doubt on the more cooperative approach. While attending a premiere for First Lady Melania Trump’s documentary film, the president was asked whether he was planning to pull back in Minnesota.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested yesterday for covering a protest inside a church in Minnesosta. On Washington Week With The Atlantic, panelists joined to discuss what implications this may have, Donald Trump’s relationship with the media, and more.

“It’s true that Donald Trump has gone after the press” before, Susan Glasser, a staff writer at The New Yorker, said last night. But “this is the first time he’s ordered the arrest of a journalist—so I do think a line has been crossed here.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This month, an international team of scientists has been trying to set up sensors on and around Thwaites Glacier, one of the most unstable in the world. It’s often called Antarctica’s “doomsday glacier” because, if it collapses, it would add two feet of sea-level rise to the world’s oceans. On Thwaites itself, part of the team will try today to drop a fiber-optic cable through a 3,200-foot borehole in the ice, near the glacier’s grounding line, where the ocean is eating away at it from below. Sometime in the next week, another part of the team, working from the South Korean icebreaker RV Araon, aims to drop another cable, which a robot will traverse once a day, down to a rocky moraine in the Amundsen Sea. The data the sensors gather over the next two years will fill gaps in basic scientific knowledge about Thawaites. They will also determine the future of an audacious idea to slow its demise.

Right now, warm water is barely cresting the moraine, then flowing down a seabed canyon toward the glacier. If this natural dam were a little taller, it could block those warm ocean currents. Using the data on current speeds and water temperatures, scientists and engineers will model whether a giant curtain atop the moraine could divert warm water away from the glacier’s base—and if it would even be possible to construct one.

To avert catastrophe in this way would be a massive undertaking: The curtain itself would need to be up to 500 feet tall and 50 miles long. But these local conditions are in such tentative balance—“on a knife’s edge,” David Holland, a climate scientist at NYU and a member of the Seabed Curtain Project, told me from the deck of the RV Araon—that Holland and some other scientists believe that an intervention could change the glacier’s fate. Of his colleagues on the boat, he may be the only one thinking along those lines right now, he said. “But everyone’s data is going to be used by people for years and years for that purpose.”

A few years ago, the curtain project was a fringe idea that John Moore, a glaciologist at the University of Lapland, and a couple of like-minded colleagues had proposed in a series of academic articles. This kind of geoengineering, meant to address the symptoms of climate change without slowing it down, was a bête noire in the glaciology community. Now more scientists are coming to see targeted interventions in our climate as inevitable. The curtain project and at least one competing idea for slowing Thwaites’s melt have raised millions of dollars—not just from the usual geoengineering proponents but from traditional philanthropic foundations.

“The idea that there’s a clean exit on climate change, people need to get over that,” Holland said, before he set out on the icebreaker. “What is the least brutal outcome for the world is what will be decided.”

Geoengineering—which could also include removing carbon dioxide from the ocean and using stratospheric aerosol injection to dim the sun—is gaining adherents in part because decarbonization simply isn’t proceeding quickly enough. This past fall, the United Nations announced that within the next decade, global temperatures will likely rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a threshold that the Paris Agreement aimed to avoid. At the same time, climate impacts are getting real—droughts are supercharging fire seasons; hotter seas are intensifying hurricanes.

Marianne Hagen, a former Norwegian deputy minister of foreign affairs, told me that she’d long considered geoengineering “science fiction and just something not worth spending a lot of time on.” Then she watched as the Ukraine war changed the conversations around her: Energy security came to the forefront of European politics, and “nobody talked about energy transition anymore.” She thought of the vulnerable coastal nations she’d visited as a government official and, in 2024, signed on to co-lead the curtain project with Moore. “I ended up in John’s camp, mostly out of despair, because I could not see a safe pathway forward for future generations without doing the necessary research on these Band-Aid, buy-time solutions,” she said.

After that, the project quickly raised initial research funding from the nonprofits Outlier Projects, run by a former Meta executive, and the Tom Wilhelmsen Foundation, founded by a prominent Norwegian shipping company. Although government agencies in the United States and United Kingdom have funded lab research on geoengineering, rich patrons have been comparably powerful funders of geoengineering in general—and the primary funders of polar-geoengineering research. “There are lots of people with lots of money, and it’s in the scale of the private sector to do this,” Holland told me.

Another group, the Arête Glacier Initiative, is investigating the idea of refreezing Thwaites to bedrock by pumping lubricating meltwater out from its base or drawing heat away with passive heat pumps. An initiative called Real Ice is trying to pump seawater atop Arctic sea ice to thicken it. “We’ve found a lot of enthusiasm among the philanthropic community” for targeted geoengineering interventions that could limit damage to coastal communities, Brent Minchew, a geophysicist at Caltech and a co-founder of Arête, told me. “These are very localized interventions for global benefits.”

Scientists agree that, absent intervention, Thwaites’s retreat will accelerate within the next century and the glacier will eventually collapse. And Thwaites acts as a cork in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which contains enough water to raise sea levels by nearly 17 feet. The price of localized interventions at Thwaites, proponents say, pales in comparison with the price of building seawalls around major cities. In one paper, Moore and two colleagues estimated that  the curtain could cost $40 billion to $80 billion to install (and $1 billion to $2 billion a year to maintain), whereas adapting to rising sea levels could cost an estimated $40 billion a year. One way or another, we are going to have to build in order to fight the sea.

But many in the science community still disagree, vehemently, both with geoengineering proposals and with the rationale for considering them at all. In a prominent paper published in the fall, the University of Exeter polar glaciologist Martin Siegert and 41 co-authors explained in detail how the curtain project, the type of refreezing that Arête wants to try, sea-ice thickening, and two other polar-geoengineering proposals would be too expensive, technically impossible, and potentially damaging to fragile ecosystems. The paper also raised a common argument against geoengineering—that pursuing these ideas is a dangerous distraction from decarbonization, the best solution to climate change.

Siegert decided to write the paper, he told me, after he was the sole dissenter at a talk on sea-ice thickening at the UN’s climate conference in 2023. He was shocked how mainstream the once-fringe field had become. To him, these ideas are so far from feasible, they offer a false hope that distracts from the necessary work of cutting back on fossil-fuel use to avoid catastrophe. Ted Scambos, a glaciologist who co-led the major U.S.-U.K. collaboration that studied the mechanisms driving Thwaites’s retreat, told me that he was once tentatively supportive of geoengineering research but, given that the Trump administration has slashed funding for climate science and renewable-energy development, is now strongly against it. “We absolutely should not fund or support efforts, or even tests, of climate or ice loss mitigation methods,” he wrote in an email. “It should be a matter of international law, and it should be set up as such immediately.” Instead, research and policies should “remain laser-focused on reducing fossil fuel use” and on minimizing the related economic impacts.

Those working on geoengineering research see opponents as equally shortsighted. Merely documenting changes to the cryosphere is like “choosing the best seat on the Titanic to listen to the last tune of the orchestra as the ship goes down,” Moore said. Studying geoengineering interventions is like “launching a few lifeboats.” At this point, decarbonization, even if it happened tomorrow, would not necessarily save Thwaites from collapse, he argued. “To decarbonize to the point at which we will be keeping the glaciers safe, you require actual magic to do that. It is delusional.”

Some proponents of projects like the sea curtain argue that they’re not a novel class of environmental action. They are an act of preservation not dissimilar from redirecting rivers and rebuilding beaches. Letting Thwaites collapse arguably violates the Antarctic Treaty System’s environmental-preservation clause, Minchew said.

How far we’re willing to go to keep the cryosphere in a recognizable shape while the world works on decarbonization is an open question. To geoengineering proponents, persuading the 29 member nations of the Antarctic Treaty with decision-making power to try to build a sea curtain looks easier than persuading the 193 members of the United Nations to, say, try seeding the atmosphere with sun-blocking chemicals. Opponents worry about breaking existing environmental protections for the region, and endangering the treaty altogether. But Holland, at least, is willing to predict the outcome of these debates.

“Fast-forward 1,000 years, the Earth will be geoengineered,” he said. “The entire climate will be regulated like a modern house—no question.” The climate may get screwed up in new ways as scientists attempt to turn the planet’s temperature dial down. But “if it survives, humanity is simply going to do this.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sam Raimi is one of Hollywood’s finest purveyors of junk. I say this with love and reverence, and with full acknowledgment that he’s the man behind such masterpieces as Evil Dead II and A Simple Plan. But the director has spent decades digging for gold amid pulpier genres, turning out oddball horror, thriller, and comic-book movies. As his career went on, Raimi graduated to making blockbuster versions of junk, including the first Spider-Man trilogy and, most recently, a Doctor Strange sequel for Marvel. His new film, Send Help, however, is a welcome throwback to his roots—a horror-comedy full of spirited, violent silliness. It’s a perfect bit of shlock.

All credit to Raimi—he’s still able to deliver on a smaller scale, which his contemporaries (such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Zemeckis) might now struggle to do. Send Help is breathtakingly unpretentious, a campfire tale that swirls a CEO’s nightmare with the fantasy of every bedraggled, overworked office drone: What if a plane crash stranded an evil boss in the jungle with a meek but capable subordinate, and their roles began to reverse? The story is essentially a stripped-down, airplane-novel version of Ruben Östlund’s Oscar-nominated Triangle of Sadness, which skewered the foolishness of capitalistic order by dumping a bunch of rich folks and service staff on a desert island.

Read: A horror movie about befriending the rich and powerful

Send Help reduces that premise further by focusing on a party of two. Bradley Preston (played by Dylan O’Brien) is a preening nepo baby in charge of a multinational corporation, and Linda Liddle (Rachel McAdams) is a harried member of the planning-and-strategy department whom he just passed over for promotion. Bradley is largely concerned with perfecting his golf game; Linda spends her off hours obsessing over the TV show Survivor. After Bradley begrudgingly invites Linda to join him on a work trip, his private jet crashes in the Gulf of Thailand, stranding the pair on a remote beach, Linda’s devotion to Survivor suddenly gets put to good use. Raimi delights in turning a mousy, reality-TV-loving woman into a boar-hunting, shelter-building alpha dog.

McAdams, who did yeoman’s work in Raimi’s previous movie (the aforementioned Marvel sequel), is the perfect fit for this kind of nonsensical Hollywood role. She has somehow mastered the ability to plausibly toggle between retiring and glamorous. She was the terrifying queen bee of Mean Girls but also the sensible, slacks-wearing junior-string reporter from Spotlight; essentially, she’s someone who can play both a wallflower and a domineering megastar without a hint of ridiculousness. Raimi has always been drawn to that kind of protagonist, from Liam Neeson’s scientist turned superhero in Darkman to Tobey Maguire’s sweetly humble take on Peter Parker in Spider-Man. But with Linda, the director only gestures at the kind of good-hearted morality embedded within those costumed heroes. For the most part, Raimi is here to have sick, progressively more twisted fun.

Unlike his co-star, O’Brien has long seemed like one of showbiz’s underutilized resources. He emerged from the world of young-adult action-adventure franchises and has since proved to have a deeper set of chops: He turned in an excellent performance last year in the dark indie comedy Twinless and stood out among the ensemble in 2022’s The Outfit, a gangster thriller. Here, O’Brien is well attuned to portraying the kind of shallow jerk that Raimi needs viewers to root against—otherwise, they might turn on Linda more quickly for keeping Bradley under her thumb. Bradley is cruel, arrogant, and seemingly low on actual talent, and that’s before he crash-lands on an island; there, he spends most of his time grumping at Linda for not finding good-enough food or not listening to his meaningless leadership prattle.

For the story’s first act, Raimi almost hints at romantic comedy—perhaps these two crazy kids will find some common ground while they’re stuck together, as Bradley learns to be a kinder boss and Linda figures out how to better stick up for herself. In the hands of a more optimistic filmmaker, maybe that would be the move. But then Linda goes chasing a wild boar through the jungle while toting a bamboo spear, and impales it to death in a gleefully gratuitous scene of CGI gore. She emerges bloodstained from the tree line—a changed woman, and not necessarily for the better.

The rest of Send Help hinges not on how these two characters will find common ground but on which one will emerge victorious from an ongoing power struggle. Sometimes they’re friendly, other times they’re openly battling, but Raimi never lets go of the core tension between them: Bradley sees Linda as less than him, and Linda sees Bradley as someone who will only really respond to domination. It’s Lord of the Flies on the corporate ladder, nudging the audience to simultaneously cheer for “eating the rich” and wonder whether Linda is losing her grip on reality. In most desert-island movies, the goal is for the characters to get rescued; to Linda, that’s merely a foolish distraction.

My overall view of the film came down to whether Raimi would nail the last act—I feared he might pull back into more sentimental territory rather than doubling down on the two characters’ ultimate enmity. I won’t spoil the details, but Send Help sticks the landing by going for broke, piling on the carnage, goo, and vomit as Linda and Bradley’s pas de deux spirals into feral madness. Last year, cinema wrestled with the limits of idealism and heroism on-screen; perhaps 2026 will be the “lol nothing matters” year in theaters. Or perhaps Raimi is just kicking it back to his more brazen early years as a director. Either way, I was happy reveling in the deplorability of it all.</div>

They had nice vases in Laukkaing, although they were a little pricey.

Not to mention barbaric. This unfortunately won&#39;t do much to curb scams. New scammers appear and just relocate.

In the US, statistics say the death penalty has very little effect. Among other things, states with the death penalty have higher homicide rates than those that have abolished it.

In most criminal acts, people only think about whether or not they will be caught; the severity of the penalty is not a significant part of the equation.

There have been many studies of this:  https://www.google.com/search?... [google.com]

If you wanted a meaningful response, you wouldn&#39;t have started with those 3 words.

My point had nothing to do with having a bleeding heart. It was whether DP is effective at deterring future crimes, by which I meant similar crimes committed  by other people, not by those executed.  And research doesn&#39;t show that It does.

You have my personal guarantee that these 11 will never ever ever again, murder, scam, or commit any other criminal act.

If that isn&#39;t a deterrent, I don&#39;t know what is.

Capital punishment, any punishment, will never deter everyone. But capital punishment is proven 100% effective against recidivism. 100% And, I&#39;m very satisfied with that.

Not to mention barbaric. This unfortunately won&#39;t do much to curb scams. New scammers appear and just relocate.It ensures the criminals will never criminal again.

They kidnap Chinese people and turn them into slaves doing scam calls, probably never to be seen again.

They executed the mafia executives. ðY(TM)

Some people are beyond hope, beyond the capabilities of the corrections system. A life of crime is all all they know, how they&#39;ve got by all their life, and it would be very near impossible to do anything about it. They&#39;d need to be permanently cut off their family and crime circles and effectively start a new life from zero. Not going to happen.

If you&#39;re beyond help and consistently provide negative value to the society, then perhaps the society is better off without you.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia.

I was in the Philippines last November attending a wedding.  The groom was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard.  He said the #1 problem he dealt with was illegal fishing.  The #2 problem he dealt with was trafficking of women and children.  He said they seize at least one boat every month with hundreds of passengers.  These women (and parents of the children) actually pay brokers to transport them over to Thailand, where they are promised employment.  Then, when they get to Thailand, they&#39;re smuggled through the country into Laos, Cambodia, or Burma to work in these locations managed by crime families, often managed by the Chinese mafia.

Never forget:  slavery still exists today.  The western world just outsourced it to poorer countries.

The fact that there are even five different unions for the same company is excellent. Too many problems with unions in the US are caused by the fact that there is no competition between unions, and you can get forced to join the union in some states. No competition is always a bad sign.

Perhaps other countries could learn something here.

there are even five different unions for the same companyAs an additional detail, this is the normal situation there, all of these unions exist nationwide; two have members everywhere, one targets middle managers, and two target workers of the IT industry. If another studio would start an unrelated strike, you&#39;d likely see the same names. The idea of nationwide unions is they can ask members in other companies sharing similar preoccupations to join a strike nationwide.

Seems like the typical case of workers producing things of value that can actually be sold...

If the workers had produced &quot;things of value&quot; in the past couple of years instead of uninspired, repetitive and boring slop, the company would not have been bought by Tencent. But the didn&#39;t and now Tencent is cleaning house.

I for one think it&#39;s a good thing that incompetence has consequences. And I hope Ubisoft can find its way again, and eventually starts delivering good games again.

I don&#39;t think you understand how games are made or how corporate decision making and execution works. Hint: it&#39;s a top-down system - 90% of the workers have very little say in what they do, they are hired to execute.

The workers produce what management tells them to, individual workers that don&#39;t produce what management requires would already have been fired. Any systemic failure is going to be down to management direction rather than failure of the lower level workers.

Not everything can be made to succeed.  It&#39;s totally possible that the buggy whip craftsmen and their managers didn&#39;t get the memo about autos and other consumer taste changes.

So who is providing the value to get these gaming studios off the ground if not investors (including the founders&#39; sweat equity)?

I would not know. Who were the investors in IdSoftware?

It is quite illegal to &quot;replace&quot; workers only because they use their legal right to negotiate working conditions. It would be a surefire way to get the company in trouble.What often happens is after negotiating something that costs the company or institution a lot of money, is that they don&#39;t replace workers who retire or otherwise leave.
Or just make a position redundant. Or outsource. 

The place I retired from had its unionized employee headcount shrink over 50 percent since the 1980&#39;s. Inverse of the rest of the place. Yeah, the remaining people were paid pretty well and had lots of bennies. It ends up like the old adage of &quot;I got mine, screw you!&quot; And further shrinkage

For chats to be private, quite a few additional requirements have to be fulfilled. For example, user private keys only on user devices and inaccessible to WhatsApp.

look man. im not a special agent. I&#39;m drunk actually. and ive always known whatApp os not private.. its not fucking rocket science. it allows you to recover the private key through SmS. fucking sms. unencrypted. from fb.

Interesting. I have never used WhatsApp, but this makes it pretty clear what is going on.

The main problem is the keys have to be accessible to the WhatsApp ... app ... itself and you have no way of validating what that does. Never mind that it isn&#39;t open source, you can&#39;t read its memory space or debug it in any way, heck if you aren&#39;t rooted you can&#39;t even read /data/data/com.whatsapp/files/ . Because you know, it&#39;s too dangerous for you to be able TO READ YOUR OWN FILES ON YOUR OWN DEVICE.

They already have the facility to read your already decrypted messages remotely via the web interface &quot;ap

If you have any type of account recovery or backup enabled then your keys are with the service provider. Usually thereâ(TM)s an option to enable enhanced security which clearly mentions no recovery or backup possible if you forget password.

In this case you chats will also open only on 1 device while other devices will say they canâ(TM)t display the chat (though few apps do offer e2e on multiple devices too)

Their encryption is inspired by, if not directly based upon, the Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) protocol [wikipedia.org].

Being a public-key encryption protocol [wikipedia.org], OTR messages can have the session key encrypted by more than one PK key, meaning that more than just the user&#39;s intended recipient can read the data.

The &quot;perfect forward secrecy&quot; and &quot;plausible deniability&quot; are still in effect, but you have two Bobs in the Alice and Bob encryption model [wikipedia.org].

Key management is a huge pain in the ass.  If you aren&#39;t personally dealing with the keying hassles, your communications are neither private nor secure.

At best, there might be a corporate policy somewhere that says that employees should not snoop.

Mrs Bezos designed the Whatsapp encryption?

... the attacker controls both ends. Nothing stops Apple or Google from just taking screen shots of those messages for selected end users. You don&#39;t need a lot of code for that, you could easily hide it everywhere. You do not even need lists of user-ids since you can obscure those away with a bloom filter.

AI Use at Alcohol Has Increased, Gallup Poll Finds

... just use it as a, power wasting, search engine?

all text editors I&#39;ve ever used had the &#39;find&#39; function; just a matter of trying some key words or synonyms.

All local, no LLM in sight other than the obe between my ears.

Personally, I&#39;m dubious about the new way of only asking about the one thing without knowing the context, but YMMV.

Which works fine until the documentation uses a synonym for the word you thought it would use.

On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen&#39;s d=0.738, p=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development. [...] Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.This is exactly what will happen: More AI-Slop produced faster, with more bugs that never get fixed. And skilled IT personnel being replaced by unskilled prompt-monkeys, because cheaper.

People flunk by using it, but they finish slight faster. So AI wins!

I&#39;ve seen many people comment on other discussion platforms they are using AI simply because the leadership at their employer is requiring it. And many of those comments follow up with how the results of the AI usage are not helpful, or worse, require checking/correcting work and resulting in a net negative for productivity verses if they had just done it themselves.

I too was wondering how much of this adoption was being forced by management rather than taken up on the user&#39;s own free will, now that would be a really interesting poll.

you are all AI slop pigs.  Pigs oink.   Oink! Oink! Oink! say you AI slop pigs as you gobble the AI slop

AI is very good for novices, people who don&#39;t know something well.

Programmers and engineers use it when working with languages and tools they don&#39;t know well.  We&#39;re all novices at some languages and tools, so AI can be useful to everybody, to some extent.

The big problem is that most of the material on the Internet on programming and engineering is done by novices.  Professionals don&#39;t have the time to be posting and even if they did they aren&#39;t allowed to share their work.

Academics have generally sold their souls to the publish-or-perish system and seldom have professional level skills, so no help there.

AI is basically all about pattern matching, so it matches work done by novices, and in practice people blindly apply that work.

This means people aren&#39;t spending time learning how to do it right, which usually involves design time, abstraction, thinking about data structures, experiments, and so forth.

Then one makes the inevitable mistakes, and learns from those mistakes - and ultimately gets better.

With AI, that whole process is short-circuited.  You get something the sort-of works, but without the whole learning process.

So it is not that AI is a bad thing, but it can be - people who don&#39;t have wisdom or guidance from others aren&#39;t going to get the learning experiences they need to get good.  They will be condemned to mediocrity.  So we&#39;re creating a culture of amateurs that don&#39;t know how to do anything well.

Really good organizations supplement the learning process with really good mentoring - and that&#39;s key to turning the talented amateurs that graduate from colleges into really good professionals.

Unfortunately, really good mentoring is quite rare, because most technical people aren&#39;t good enough at either their technical skills or the people skills (or both) to be good mentors, and most organizations don&#39;t know how to run a good mentoring program.  By that I mean substance, not illusion.  Lots of managers can manage the illusion part - we&#39;re mentoring, check that box off!

A good mentoring program can help ensure that AI doesn&#39;t lead organizations down the wrong paths, and that people develop the genuine high level skills they need to produce high quality products that will generate long term income from repeat customers.

Most organizations don&#39;t know how to run such a program, so they rely on patents, trademarks, copyright, and cost-of-entry barriers to make up for all the quality failures in their products that happen because their people don&#39;t have the skills they need.

It&#39;s another reason to be very suspicious of whether or not IP law is actually providing a genuine benefit to society, as least as it is currently implemented.  Basic legal protection from counter-fitting would probably be more efficient and beneficial to society than current IP law.

AI is very good for novices, people who don&#39;t know something well.There is plenty of evidence already that novices using AI will remain novices, rather than develop advanced skills. So yes, as a &quot;novice&quot;, you can get to some result quicker by using AI, but the result will be that of a &quot;fool with a tool&quot;, and your next work&#39;s result won&#39;t be better, because you didn&#39;t learn anything.

I just wrote up a slightly different take on the exact same situation you described.  As a fellow &quot;advanced&quot; gray beard with decades of experience and broad knowledge of all the various &quot;cool architectures du jour&quot; that have popped up and gone away in that time, I feel that I am (as you are) fully qualified in writing code that others consider to be of &quot;superior&quot; quality.

&#39;Executives numb from the neck up use it&#39;

I mean, yes, you&#39;re right in that a novice using AI will very likely never advance much beyond being a novice.  Which sucks and I don&#39;t have any answers for that yet.  It&#39;s a HUGE looming issue and even my younger son is caught up in this mess trying to find a job when companies have absolutely put the brakes on hiring &quot;novices&quot; out of school (not even sure I&#39;d call him a novice as he&#39;s quite competent but apparently &quot;right out of school&quot; immediately removes you from consideration at mo

Some of this is real, no doubt about it, especially if you&#39;re a coder or someone whose job is to create spam or shitty advertisements or run chatbots.

But a lot of this is people using ai because its been pushed violently in front of us. Just see how MSFT tried to replace microsoft word with it, or how google has you look at AI before any actual search results. And then there are the employers who mandate it. When you that and then survey the results and find people are using it more, that doesn&#39;t translate to it actually being more useful.

I do use LLM-type AI &quot;daily&quot; too. DDG gives an AI answer by default. As that is somewhat useful in, maybe, 50% of all simpler searches, I leave it on. But does that mean I have &quot;integrated AI into my workflow&quot;? Hell, no. That claim would be a direct lie.

While it&#39;s not mandatory at my company (which is fairly large) AI is strongly encouraged to be used by all employees of any job.  My team is tracking our AI usage of a particular type to see how useful it is.  Team leads have integrated AI into their workflows with PR reviews, generating meeting agendas, let alone code production.  All because of a giant top down push for AI, AI, AI.

And, of course, the company is now providing &quot;AI&quot; products.  (thanks Steve)

Is it any wonder that a poll finds AI use has incre

This study notes that it has defined &quot;frequent use&quot; to mean &quot;a few times a week&quot;, which most people would consider &quot;occasional&quot; rather than &quot;frequent&quot;. It then goes on to use the word &quot;frequent&quot; according to this fraudulent definition.

I might go full Steve Ballmer on any motherfucker that calls these things flying cars one more time. They are electric helicoptors. Electric multi-rotor fuckthings. Fuck!

In The Jetsons the aerocars are antigravity devices that operate effectively like cars only moving through the air. Notice for example a cop on a hover thing &quot;pulling them over&quot; stationary in midair while a ticket is being written. A conceit and premise in The Jetsons is that they live in the sky (for unspecified reasons) but has all of the properties of living on the ground for practical purposes.

Appealing to a fantasy antigravity vehicle that does function like a car is not a strong case in favor there.

They&#39;re accepting orders. That means they&#39;re selling them. And that means they&#39;re for sale.

But like you said, we&#39;ll see whether they&#39;re still around in 9 to 12 months. If their &quot;blackfly&quot; is like the one I grew up swatting away in Ontario, they&#39;ll disappear sometime in the early summer after making a damn nuisance of theselves leaving painful, itchy bites.

I&#39;m pretty sure they will still be around. I have no connection to them, other than following them on social media for years, but if they were going to do a rug pull that would have happened a LONG time ago. It&#39;s a little surprising to me that it&#39;s taken this long for them to start taking orders, since their first demonstration flights with a pilot inside were so long ago that I can&#39;t remember how long it&#39;s been.

The 20 mile range makes this mostly an expensive toy.  Would it be amusing to fly?  Probably....though I can think of a lot better uses for $200k burning a hole in my pocket.

Precisely my thoughts.  This is a toy for hopping across San Francisco bay.

Total payload is 220lbs.  One guy.  You will not be going shopping in this.

It&#39;s not a car; it&#39;s an aircraft (seriously, just look at it -- there&#39;s no way this will be rolling down Hwy 101), so takeoff and landing need to be, at best, on a helipad -- which you will have to clear immediately for the next guy coming in whose battery is going flat.

1) 1907, by Paul Cornu.  He called it a helicopter.  Did not go commercial until Sikorsky in 1939.  You can keep it in your back yard, go straight up, needs no runway, fly anywhere, that&#39;s a personal flying vehicle, how is it different than a flying car?

2) 1930 if you demand a road ready vehicle for under $10,000 in 2026 dollars.   Barry Bushmeyer created the first Powered Parachute.  This is a wheeled vehicle with a pusher fan to push it forward.  Get up to 25 miles per hour, release a parachute and up up away you go.  You can get up to 10,000 feet in the air, with a max speed of 35 mph.

Helicopters are super expensive and hard to fly.  PPCs are cheap, easy and fun to use - but are s.l.o.w.    Faster, cheaper, safer, easier is what we have been working on it.

But we have definitely had commercially available flying cars for almost a century.

I&#39;ll honestly be surprised if this thing ever sees the light of day, and I hope it doesn&#39;t. Have you seen the way people drive??

It sounds more like a another grift, we gots da flyin&#39; car yada yada yada, give us the moneys and then someday (lol maybe) we give you...something. Maybe not dat soopah doopah thing we promised you, but, hey, you&#39;re already into it for $50 large, we got you by the balls.

I seriously hope this is just a stupid grift.

It&#39;s a small airplane.  The concept of a &quot;flaying car&quot; is that you can drive it on their road AND fly it in the air.

I respect people who are willing to sink money into ambitious projects like this, but this is about as safe as a hangglider.Hang glider pilot here -- a hang glider is much safer than this vehicle.  A hang glider has zero moving parts, zero electronics, zero propellers, and zero batteries/fuel, so there&#39;s much less than can go wrong with it in flight... and even if you do somehow lose control and crash, there&#39;s nothing flammable on board, and your speed is typically low enough that your injuries will be minimal.The Helix is a very cool vehicle, but I&#39;m glad it&#39;s other people flying it and not me :)

I&#39;m kind of surprised by the shape.   It doesn&#39;t have to be long, it could be tall.  You&#39;re unlikely to be going fast enough to really care about the additional cross-section, and you could make it step-in, step out.

Stand it on end and reconfigure the seat.  You&#39;d have much, much better visibility for the pilot.

It&#39;s been possible to order a flying car on the internet for 30 years.  It&#39;s just getting one delivered that&#39;s the problem.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, typing to you from underneath a sooty, icy snow boulder that has covered the entirety of D.C. for a week. But we’re not mad. Stop saying we’re mad.

Much of the week’s news revolved around the killing of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Republicans’ scrambling to limit the fallout. As the week went on, we got a new Fed chair announcement, Tulsi Gabbard showing up at an FBI raid in Georgia, and what appears to be a long weekend government shutdown? Don Lemon, you will have to wait until next week, sorry. If only the Surge could control the flow and spacing of news events, the world would run a lot smoother.

Let’s begin with the Cabinet member bearing most of the blame for the events of Minnesota.

The lack of turnover in the second Trump administration has been a marked difference from the first term. Top staff and Cabinet members aren’t getting axed left and right. The only high-level change we’ve seen has been former national security adviser Mike Waltz getting “demoted” to United Nations ambassador for getting slippery-fingered with his group chat invites. There’s a reason for this shift: President Donald Trump, as he reportedly felt during the deliberations over Waltz’s future, doesn’t want to give the liberal media a “scalp.” It’s a sign of weakness to, uh, provide accountability following screw-ups.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week seemed to come the closest a Cabinet official has come to a Trump axing this term. The administration flinched from its initial (and typical) belligerent messaging following the Customs and Border Protection killing of Pretti in Minneapolis. That left Noem out on a limb. It was Noem, after all, whose department oversaw the Minneapolis operation and Noem who, as the face of that department, said in the press conference afterward that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.” Democratic calls for her impeachment shot through the roof—and even some Republicans called on her to step down, as well. (More on that later.) Noem met with the president for two hours Monday night to plead her case. For now, it looks like Trump’s instincts not to give the media a “scalp” are winning out. Or, as with Waltz, he’s just waiting a spell for the fires to calm down before sending her on her way.

Noem wasn’t the only administration official rushing to call Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” White House policy chief and all-around architect of heavy-handedness Stephen Miller also called Pretti that, as well as an “assassin” looking to “murder” agents. Team Noem, in its effort to save her, went running to Axios to blame Miller for the incendiary language. We fully believe her. Immediately calling someone an “assassin” or “terrorist” without knowing much information is Miller’s M.O., and Miller is more powerful than Noem. Of course the administration’s ludicrous initial response was his handiwork.

Miller, however, is a master at deflecting consequences when his own aggressive policy views put the administration in hot water. During the outrage over family separation during Trump’s first term, then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lost her job while Miller mysteriously kept his, as journalist Jonathan Blitzer pointed out. Amid the Minnesota outrage, Noem is the Cabinet official in trouble, Border Patrol “commander” Greg Bovino was schlepped back to rural California to await his retirement, while Miller continues to run administration policy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for better or worse, summed up Miller’s job security accurately on Fox News this week. “To my colleagues who believe that you can convince Donald Trump that Stephen Miller is a liability for him, good luck with that,” he said. “When this clock strikes 12 on the Trump era, there will be a few people walking out the door with Donald Trump. Stephen Miller will be in that group.”

After the Pretti killing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took the position that Democrats wouldn’t advance a bill funding DHS without new reforms to immigration enforcement. The DHS funding was supposed to be included in a package with five other departmental funding bills and voted on this week, before a Friday night deadline. Schumer and Democrats demanded Republicans strip the DHS funding portion from the package, pass the other five, and buy a little time to work on DHS reforms. After a few days of talks, Senate Republicans and the White House … agreed to this! As we type, the Senate is slowly processing this agreement. (That’s Senate shorthand for waiting out a Lindsey Graham hissy fit.) Once they’re done, the House is expected to vote on the deal Monday. So there may be a wee technical funding gap for a few days, but nothing to write home about.

The deal extends DHS funding for only two weeks, setting up a sprint to legislate on the most contentious issue in politics. Schumer, with feedback from his caucus, has settled on three demands: ending roving patrols by ICE while tightening warrant rules, establishing a universal code of conduct governing federal law enforcement officers’ use of force, and barring officers from wearing masks while requiring them to turn on bodycams and have proper identification. These demands will run into issues from both directions. Progressives will (and are) chastising Democrats for asking for too little at a time when Republicans are reeling on this issue. And if DHS funding negotiations are going to be reopened, Republicans will put together their own series of requests targeting, for example, sanctuary cities. This won’t be easy.

Trump announced Friday morning that he would nominate financier Kevin Warsh to replace Jay Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve once Powell’s term ends in mid-May. Is this good? At least Trump picked someone from the requisite profession instead of a money-related figure from TV, such as Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo or pro wrestling’s Ted “Million Dollar Man” DiBiase. Warsh served on the Fed Board from 2006 to 2011 and worked closely with then-Chair Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis. He was Trump’s runner-up for the chairmanship in 2017, losing out to Powell. On another note, Warsh’s father-in-law is Ron Lauder, the cosmetics magnate and GOP donor responsible for putting the idea of annexing Greenland into Trump’s head.

If and when he is confirmed, the question will be to what extent he separates himself from the debasement he deployed to earn the job. Warsh was known for his hawkish monetary policy views following the 2008 financial crisis, worrying that lower interest rates then would cause inflation. (He was quite wrong about that.) But then he wanted to become Fed chair, and so his views have conveniently evolved. In a July interview, he described the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates” as a “mark against them” and added, “One of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” Was he saying what he needed to say to get the job, or does he intend to make interest rate decisions at the president’s urging?

The FBI raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia, on Wednesday because Donald Trump is out of his mind, and his political appointees will do whatever it takes to make him happy. The raid is related to Trump’s dangerous psychological holdup that he won the 2020 election, as well as a means of revenge against Fulton County for prosecuting him. And so a dozen or so agents dug around to search for “physical ballots from the 2020 general election,” per the warrant. If only this were all a joke. As Slate contributor Rick Hasen writes, the raid could be “a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026.” Democratic lawyers may want to consider ramping up their strength training ahead of the fall season.

The most hallucinatory part of the raid, though, may have been the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the scene. It had seemed as if Gabbard was mothballed since the administration took its turning toward bombing, or threatening the further bombing of, various countries. As the Wall Street Journal reported, though, Gabbard “has spent months investigating the results of the 2020 election” and is “leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes.” This is dark stuff. Playing gumshoe on conspiracy theories surrounding past domestic elections is not in the purview of the DNI’s office, and also, Gabbard is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Whatever report she reduces should, then, be laughable. The election-related executive orders it prompts Trump to release won’t be.

As we noted here a couple of weeks ago, retiring North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has been hammering Trump policy of late but has been loath to directly criticize the president himself. Tillis issued a blockade of Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve once Fed Chair Jay Powell announced he was under investigation, and he called the administration’s pursuit of annexing Greenland “stupid.” In both cases, he laid blame on Trump’s staff for giving him bad advice, rather than on the president for having a bad brain that thinks bad thoughts. Tillis came out firing again this week over the administration’s handling of the Pretti killing, calling for the firing of Kristi Noem. “I think what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters. Once again, though, he framed it in a way that absolved Trump: “It’s just amateurish. It’s terrible. It’s making the president look bad.”

So how does the president feel about this approach that Tillis has taken? Is he fooled by Tillis calling all of his administration’s policies stupid but saying it’s the advisers’ fault? “Well, they’re both losers,” Trump told ABC News on Wednesday of Tillis and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who had also called on Noem to resign. “You know, what can I tell you? They’re terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone.” Tillis’ response to being called a “loser” was, at least, clever. “I am thrilled about that. That makes me qualified to be homeland security secretary and senior adviser to the president,” referring to Noem and Stephen Miller, whom Tillis also despises. He is getting closer each week to blaming the person who continues to employ these chuckleheads and, thus, is responsible for them. Will he one day cross that line?

On Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was speaking at a district event when a man stood up, squirted her with some sort of liquid, and then was tackled to the ground and restrained by Omar’s security detail. Despite members of her team saying she should end her appearance to have tests of the liquid done, Omar insisted on continuing. The assailant, identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, had the sort of online posting history that you would expect and had told a neighbor that he might be arrested at an upcoming Omar event. He was charged with assault, and the liquid was determined to be apple cider vinegar and water. This story about his life is sad.

Omar was direct in pinning blame for the incident. “What the facts have shown since I’ve gotten into elected office,” she said Wednesday, “is that every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.” Indeed, Trump has directed years of racist invective toward Ilhan Omar, all of which has taken on a new acuity as the administration targets the Minnesota Somali community in general. The incident did not prompt a change of heart in Trump’s rhetoric toward Omar. “I think she’s a fraud,” he told ABC News. “I really don’t think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Lawyers love legal reasoning. It promises a clean, clear path through sticky, tricky territory. But legal reasoning can enable grotesque real-world outcomes, like torture, or arresting journalists, or masked government agents detaining and disappearing people. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is in conversation with Joseph Margulies, Professor of Practice of Government at Cornell University. Margulies litigated some of the biggest cases of egregious human rights violations of the post-9/11 “War on Terror”, an experience that informed his recent piece in the Boston Review: The Moral Stupefaction of America. Margulies explains how, when we allow obscure legal language to overshadow moral imperatives, we can end up in very dark places. The line from waterboarding at black sites to executing American citizens in the streets is a straight one. And there will be a lawyer willing to write a memo for all of it.

Why is the Trump administration arresting journalists and activists over a protest inside a Minnesota church? The official reason the government cited Friday—when it arrested independent journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, as well as two others—was that they were part of a “coordinated attack” on Cities Church in St. Paul. It’s a strange claim: Videos from the incident, which occurred Jan. 18, showed protesters being loud in interrupting a worship service, but not physically touching anyone or damaging any property. The protest may have been unpleasant for those in the pews—videos showed at least one man haranguing people for their complicity in supporting ICE—but it’s hardly an “attack.”

The incident has, however, gone viral in conservative media—proof positive of the degeneracy of the Minnesota protesters and yet another example of the left’s anti-Christian bigotry. Critics of the protest portrayed it as an intrusion of vulgar politics into a sacred refuge from daily life, a faceoff between vicious activists and apolitical (and bewildered) parishioners. For an administration obsessed with firing up its base supporters, arresting participants has an obvious political use. That’s especially true of Lemon, who because of his former job at CNN is a household name and much-reviled figure on the right.

But this isn’t just a case of red meat for the base. These activists have, perhaps inadvertently, come up against some very well-connected people. Despite efforts to portray it as an apolitical island of faith, Cities Church has extensive ties to a deeply political network within the larger Christian nationalism movement—a network with ties to the upper echelons of the Trump administration.

Some of the connections are obvious: The protest was aimed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who served as a lay pastor at the church. The pastor, David Easterwood, was not an employee of the church but one of a number of elders in it. He serves as the field officer for ICE’s operations in St. Paul and has appeared publicly with Kristi Noem. And Cities Church’s lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, primarily preaches of standard Biblical matters, but he’s not above politics—or broadcasting about it on social media. He has discussed the evils of “transgenderism” and called the pope an “idiot.”

But the more important ties go deeper. Cities Church was founded 11 years ago by a group of theologically conservative men, including a pastor named Joe Rigney. Rigney is no longer a pastor at Cities Church, but he still speaks for it in conservative media appearances. “This is not a political church,” he told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum. “This is a church that worships Jesus. Loves one another. Seeks the good of their neighbors.”

“It’s a normal congregation of Christian worshippers,” he said on a separate Fox News segment, speaking to Harris Faulkner. “Every town in this country is filled with people like this who want to worship Jesus, love one another, serve their neighbor, seek the good of these cities.”

But Rigney himself is focused on much more than worshiping Jesus and loving one another. Rigney is currently a pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Christ Church is an extremely controversial church, known for essentially taking over the town as part of a religious effort led by a pastor named Doug Wilson. Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches have hard-right views on women’s rights, including opposition to women’s suffrage. Wilson has also begun an effort to expand his sphere of influence into Washington: He opened a second campus of Christ Church in D.C. in 2025 with the explicit goal of molding powerful Republicans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a church affiliated with the network.

“With the change in administration, we believe that there will be many strategic opportunities with numerous evangelicals who will be present both in and around the Trump administration,” Wilson wrote in a blog post at the time. “These believers are obviously culturally engaged already, but we happen to believe that every form of cultural engagement needs to have a solid theological foundation and support, and we want to help to provide it.”

Rigney, as part of this movement, is a highly political figure. He comments on partisan politics on social media, calling, for example, to end Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage. He has written an entire book criticizing “the sin of empathy.” He has appeared on chummy podcasts with William Wolfe, a Baptist activist and author who wrote of Alex Pretti’s killing: “Another foolish person has lost their life trying to obstruct ICE. Here’s my reaction: I don’t care.”

There’s a legitimate debate over how to treat worship spaces in a time of encroaching authoritarianism. But in its discussion of the church protest, conservative media—and now the Trump administration—have presented it as a struggle between leftists and apolitical Christians. That’s a lie: The conversation around the St. Paul church protest should not assume political intentions on just one side.

In the wake of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti during Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, the closest thing to “accountability” we’ve seen is Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino being sent back to California. It’s not enough but it’s something.

Late Thursday night, former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested by federal agents at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Independent journalist Georgia Fort was arrested as well, along with activists Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy. The arrests stem from a protest at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the pastor is also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Protesters entered the church chanting “ICE out,” disrupting services. Troubling though this may be—places of worship have often been considered off-limits for political protest—the protesters did not assault anyone or even destroy property. Whatever protesters did or didn’t do, Lemon was not demonstrating; he identified himself as a journalist and was clear he was documenting the protest, not participating in it. These arrests came after the Trump Department of Justice’s original criminal complaint against Lemon was rejected because a federal judge—a man who was a former clerk for conservative icon Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and a George W. Bush appointee—found there was no probable cause to arrest him.

Still, Lemon found himself under arrest for the crime of doing journalism. The White House tweeted out: “When life gets you lemons…” followed by two chain emojis and an image of Lemon, accusing him of “involvement in the St. Paul church riots.”

Even for an administration that has spent a year violating the First Amendment in all kinds of novel ways, the arrest of a prominent journalist is a shock—a five-alarm fire moment.

It also shows just how far this administration is willing to go to solidify its control. And it raises the question of just how far Donald Trump’s most loyal followers will follow him. Already, some of them have ceded their fealty to their most valued constitutional amendment—not the First, but the Second. And that willingness to quickly shake off once-sacrosanct beliefs does not bode well for all of our freedoms to speak, protest, and publish.

The Second Amendment, conservatives and Supreme Court justices have complained, is a “disfavored right.” In arguments earlier this month over a Hawaii gun law that limited the ability of people to carry a concealed weapon onto private property, Chief Justice John Roberts asked Neal Katyal, the attorney for the state of Hawaii, why a political candidate door-knocking could under the First Amendment approach private homes and make his case, but under Hawaii’s law couldn’t do so with a gun on him. The conservative justices seemed largely united in their view that the Second Amendment allows an expansive individual right to carry a firearm—a right that is just as expansive as the First Amendment’s protections of free speech and assembly.

Just days after those oral arguments, Alex Pretti was shot multiple times by Customs and Border Protection agents. The conservative reaction to his killing has raised important questions of just how much the right actually cares about gun rights, if the person exercising those rights is a liberal. But it’s raised even more important, and less-discussed, questions about the First Amendment, and the troubling ways in which the rights to speak and protest are being aggressively eroded by this administration and its supporters—including the one-time self-styled conservative warriors for free speech.

This administration’s about-face on the Second Amendment has rightly merited accusations of hypocrisy, and has signaled the willingness of its followers to again relinquish a once-foundational principle out of unbroken loyalty to their Dear Leader. In reality, though, this administration is not going to strip gun rights away from American citizens—at least not those who support the MAGA movement. Despite Trump’s complaints about guns at anti-ICE actions, the legal interpretations of the Second Amendment will likely only grow more ludicrously capacious under this regime.

The First Amendment, though, is a different matter. And it’s the rights within it—to assemble, to speak, to protest, to practice one’s religion, to petition one’s government, to a free press—that are quickly becoming, to both paraphrase Roberts and understate the urgency of the matter, disfavored.

In Minneapolis, Pretti’s gun was holstered. He wasn’t wielding it or intimidating anyone with it, let alone threatening anyone’s life. The Trump administration has nevertheless branded him a “domestic terrorist” and a “would-be assassin.” They have suggested that any opponent of the administration who peacefully exercises their Second Amendment right might forfeit their right to life.

And even more troubling: The administration and its agents are arguing that opponents might lose their lives or their liberty for peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights.

“When politicians, community leaders, and some journalists engage in that heated rhetoric we keep talking about, when they make the choice to vilify law enforcement, calling law enforcement names like Gestapo or using the term kidnapping, that is a choice that has made their actions and consequences that come from those choices,” Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino said in a press conference over the weekend. “When someone chooses to listen to a politician, a so-called journalist, or a community leader that spouts that type of vilification towards law enforcement or anything else … there are consequences and actions there also, I think we saw that yesterday.”

The “consequences” he’s referring to: Alex Pretti’s death.

Bovino is not the only administration official who has implied that the consequences for free speech might be death. “For months, we’ve been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in early January. “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

Last summer, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin claimed that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents” and threatened to “prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law” (photographing and videotaping law enforcement in public is legally protected behavior). Noem defined as “violence” “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.”

White House border czar Tom Homan also blamed “the rhetoric,” not trigger-happy agents, for violence against demonstrators. “I said in March—if the rhetoric doesn’t stop, there is gonna be bloodshed,” he said at a press conference on Thursday. “And there has been.” What Homan actually said back in March was this: “Do I expect violence to escalate? Absolutely.” In February, he warned, “I’m coming to Boston and I’m bringing Hell with me.” Over the summer, he publicly fantasized about beating up a Democratic member of Congress.

In his most recent press conference, Homan referred to ICE agents in Minneapolis as being in “theater”—a term usually used for a region to which soldiers are deployed in combat.

ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents seem to have gotten the message that they are at war, that the penalty for speech they don’t like might be death, and that they have free rein to assault or even kill those who offend, challenge, or simply just annoy them. “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” one officer is seen on video saying to an observer. “Listen, have y’all not learned from the past couple of days?” another agent asked citizens who were (legally) filming him in public soon after the Renee Good killing. “Have you not learned?” Agents have, without charges, been detaining witnesses to their violence, it seems to simply intimidate them into shutting up. Yet another federal agent told a woman filming him, “We have a nice little database and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”

After Good’s killing, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act “if the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.” Members of his administration have defined “attacking” ICE as filming them, alerting the public to their presence, or calling them fascists—all protected forms of speech, protest, and expression. Right-wing members of the House have renewed calls for the use of the Insurrection Act in the wake of Pretti’s killing. The Insurrection Act would allow Trump to put U.S. soldiers on the streets, and while it does not impose martial law or formally suspend the civil liberties guaranteed to Americans by the Constitution, it is an enormous escalation that treats protesters as domestic enemies. It would almost surely curtail civil liberties by default, if not by law. And while it briefly seemed that Trump and administration officials had somewhat cooled their rhetoric in the wake of a mass publish backlash over the Pretti killing, their arrest of Lemon suggests that they’ve again changed tactics—and that they remain willing to bring the full force of the federal government down on U.S. citizens simply for exercising their First Amendment rights.

This is all coming in the context of an administration that has been more overtly hostile to the First Amendment rights of free speech and expression than any in modern history. The FBI recently searched the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson, claiming they were looking for “illegal leaks”; Natanson had been reporting on the administration’s gutting of the federal workforce. Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was walking home when masked federal agents grabbed her off of the street, forced her into a van, and ferried her off to a detention center thousands of miles away where they continued deportation proceedings against her—not because she had broken the law, but because the government didn’t like the content of a pro-Palestinian op-ed she wrote. Emmy Award–winning journalist Mario Guevara, who spent two decades covering immigration and the Latino community in Atlanta and had a valid work permit, was arrested by ICE, detained for more than 100 days, and eventually deported to El Salvador. The administration claimed Guevara’s filming of ICE officers—his reporting—constituted a risk to public safety. Retired police officer Larry Bushart of Tennessee was arrested and jailed for more than a month over a Facebook post about Charlie Kirk (the post quoted Trump saying “we have to get over it” about a school shooting).

The existing infringements on the First Amendment have been bad. But what this administration is signaling may be coming could be much worse.

Back in September, the White House released a memo promising to crack down on “domestic terrorism,” which they say is “under the umbrella of self-described ‘anti-fascism.’ ” When it comes to anti-fascism, the memo says, “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” Acts of domestic terrorism, they say, include “doxing”—which the administration has defined as simply identifying an ICE officer—and “civil disorder,” by which they mean protest.

Many conservatives spent the whole of the Biden administration crowing about infringements on their First Amendment rights—the wokescolds who wouldn’t let them use racial slurs anymore, the tyrannical government that set limits on public gatherings in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Now that their side is in charge, though, any commitment to the freedoms of speech and assembly seems to have evaporated in favor of retribution and crushing the opposition. This is exceedingly dangerous: Rights are meaningless if the only people who have them are those the regime believes will submit.

Liberals should hope that the administration’s willingness to infringe upon Second Amendment freedoms will be a wake-up call to the gun-obsessed right. Maybe threats to the Second Amendment, even if they’re largely rhetorical, will make a few conservatives take notice of how this regime is on a mission to actually obliterate the First.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/01/uk_military_ajax_vehicle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The British Army&#39;s ill-fated Ajax armored vehicle program now faces the prospect of being axed as the Ministry of Defence withdraws its initial operating capability status and reviews its future.

Ajax, a tracked reconnaissance vehicle intended for the Army&#39;s Armoured Brigade Combat and Artillery Fire Support Teams, has been in the news off and on due to reports of it causing health problems among the crew.

Initial operating capability (IOC) was declared for the platform last November, amidst assurances that any issues with the units, which resemble smallish tanks, had been ironed out. But a number of service personnel have since reported symptoms consistent with noise and vibration effects during training exercises, leading to it being put on hold last week.

This week, Defence Secretary John Healey told the Parliamentary Defence Committee: &quot;It is clear we did not have the full facts in the lead-up to decisions about the initial operating capability.&quot;

That IOC has now been withdrawn, and the Army is no longer in charge of this program, with responsibility passed instead to the National Armaments Director, as The Register reported.

But Healey went further, telling the committee: &quot;I have been clear that we must back it or scrap it. The work is being done at the moment in order to put us in a position to make that decision.&quot;

This appears to confirm that the government may be preparing to cancel Ajax if the outstanding issues with the vehicle cannot be easily addressed.

Neither option is particularly palatable, as critics have alleged that some flaws in the vehicle&#39;s chassis - built by contractor General Dynamics - may be contributing to the ongoing problems.

But a decision to scrap the vehicles would cause a different headache, as the program is already years behind schedule and it would effectively mean starting over with a selection process to find a replacement, while the Ministry of Defence is said to be facing a budget shortfall already.

Ajax is also the name for the overarching program, which aims to fill six different roles for the Army, based on the same chassis. Ares is an armored personnel carrier, Athena is a command vehicle, Argus is the engineering version, Atlas is a recovery vehicle, and Apollo is a repair unit.

It is understood that about 170 vehicles have so far been delivered, covering all of these roles, with the largest number being the Ajax reconnaissance unit.

Alternatives to take the place of Ajax could be the CV90 from BAE Systems or the Rheinmetall Lynx, both of which are already in service with other European armies.

Another option is to simply develop a reconnaissance variant of the Boxer Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV), now entering service with the British Army. Boxer has a modular design that allows mission-specific modules to be fitted to its eight-wheeled chassis.

The Ministry was asked to confirm whether axing Ajax is being considered, but a spokesperson merely pointed us to an earlier statement from the Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry, Luke Pollard MP, who said: &quot;We will need to decide on the platform&#39;s future shortly, and that is being considered as part of the forthcoming Defence Investment Plan.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic&#39;s Claude machine learning model has boldly planned what no Claude has planned before – a path across Mars for NASA&#39;s Perseverance rover.

Perseverance traveled about 400 meters on the Martian surface last month based on an AI-generated path. It did so with the blessing of engineers at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), who decided to delegate the meticulous work of route planning to Anthropic&#39;s AI model.

As Anthropic explains in its writeup of the milestone, the surface of Mars can be treacherous for rovers. No one wants to be responsible for getting pricey space kit stuck in the sand, as happened with the Spirit rover in 2009.

So the Perseverance team spends a fair amount of time on route planning. This involves consulting orbital and surface imagery of Mars in order to set a series of waypoints to guide the rover&#39;s movements. Once plotted, this data gets transmitted about 140 million miles or 225 million kilometers – the average distance from Earth to Mars – where it&#39;s received by Perseverance as a navigational plan. Live-driving via joystick isn&#39;t feasible given the distance involved.

Perseverance has an AutoNav system that handles real-time decision making. &quot;AutoNav allows the rover to autonomously re-plan its route around rocks or other obstacles on its way to a pre-established destination,&quot; NASA explains.

The re-planning may not be needed if the pre-planning went well.

The pre-planning is &quot;time-consuming&quot; and &quot;laborious,&quot; as Anthropic puts it, so JPL researchers decided to let Claude – using its vision capabilities – have a go.

&quot;Generative AI provided the analysis of the high-resolution orbital imagery from the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera aboard NASA&#39;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and terrain-slope data from digital elevation models,&quot; JPL said in an online post. &quot;After identifying critical terrain features – bedrock, outcrops, hazardous boulder fields, sand ripples, and the like – it generated a continuous path complete with waypoints.&quot;

Claude generated Rover commands in Rover Markup Language (RML), which is based on XML. The version of Claude available on the web could not emit RML when asked and initially denied any knowledge of RML. When pointed to Anthropic&#39;s statement on the matter, Claude responded, &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right, and I apologize for my initial response!&quot; Nonetheless, Claude could not provide an example of RML, a shortcoming that the model attributed to the lack of a publicly documented standard.

But Claude evidently did generate RML when it had access to NASA&#39;s data. And that&#39;s when the humans took the opportunity to check the route plan. AI models make mistakes and, even if that weren&#39;t a concern, that&#39;s just the sort of thing one does when programming rovers on other planets. Using a simulator representing a virtual replica of the rover, JPL engineers checked more than 500,000 telemetry variables about the rover&#39;s projected position and potential obstacles. And they made corrections.

&quot;When the JPL engineers reviewed Claude&#39;s plans, they found that only minor changes were needed,&quot; Anthropic said. &quot;For instance, ground-level camera images (which Claude hadn&#39;t seen) gave a clearer view of sand ripples on either side of a narrow corridor; the rover drivers elected to split the route more precisely than Claude had at this point. But otherwise, the route held up well. The plans were sent to Mars, and the rover successfully traversed the planned path.&quot;

On Martian days (sols) 1,707 and 1,709 (starting from the landing date 18 February 2021 at 08.55pm GMT), which corresponded to December 8 and December 10, 2025, Perseverance executed routes planned by AI instead of humans.

The rover didn&#39;t follow the set route exactly. NASA&#39;s image of the December 10 path shows that the pre-planned route and the actual route differ slightly, presumably based on decisions made by the AutoNav system. But AI played a role, one many models can be expected to reprise as vision-language-actions models become more capable and get stuffed into robots.

&quot;This demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds,&quot; said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman in a statement. &quot;Autonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It&#39;s a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations.&quot;

Anthropic reports that JPL engineers say Claude can cut the time required for route planning in half. The AI biz however failed specify the amount of time being halved. Representatives of Anthropic and JPL couldn&#39;t immediately be reached to quantify that fraction. ®

            <h2>Broadcom 'bulldozes' VMware cloud partners as March deadline looms</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/31/broadcom_vmware_cloud_partners/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive Broadcom this week brought the hammer down on the Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service Providers (VCSPs) – and the clock is now ticking for any third parties working to close sales.

For customers, this potentially represents a massive supplier shake-up, with sources claiming that hundreds of CSPs across Europe are affected.

The news may not come as a shock to Reg readers because the direction of travel was indicated when Broadcom shuttered VMware&#39;s reseller/solution provider schemes in early 2024 and moved to the invite-only Broadcom Advantage Partner Program. Broadcom has also started to license new bundles, including products previously sold as standalone, and altered support for perpetual license holders.

Dramatic changes also hit cloud service providers. Broadcom gave notice on October 31 that it was phasing out the VCSP program and sunsetting the White Label model for partners in the European Economic Area. It is now moving to an invite-only model with fewer authorized providers and this week informed affected partners.

On Monday, in a non-renewal email seen by The Register, Broadcom said: &quot;We are providing this formal notice that we have closed the current Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service Provider (VCSP) partners, and will not be renewing any of your VCSP partner contracts with Broadcom after 26 January 2026.&quot;

&quot;You may continue to transact new and existing coterminous customer opportunities through the end of your current commitment contract term. The term for any new contracts executed during this period must be coterminous with a current active commitment contract that you have with Broadcom. However, we encourage you to close any open opportunities you may be pursuing by 31 March 2026.&quot;

In an FAQ document also seen by El Reg, Broadcom said the reason for not continuing with certain authorized VCSPs pertains to &quot;evolving customer requirements&quot; – it didn&#39;t specify what these are – and to &quot;enable increased adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation as the core private cloud platform.&quot; This means Broadcom needs to &quot;work more closely with a focused set of partners.&quot;

CSPs may &quot;execute&quot; new coterminous customer contracts and keep servicing existing customers under VCSP commitments for the remainder of the contract terms with Broadcom, their Cloud Commerce Manager, or their Primary White Label Provider partners.

&quot;You may not execute any new Aggregate commitment contracts nor any renewals for existing commitment contracts, so that a timely and orderly wind-down of the current Program can become effective at the end of your existing commitment contract term(s),&quot; the notice states.

The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers of Europe trade group (CISPE), which is pressing the European Commission to overturn its approval of Broadcom&#39;s buy of VMware on antitrust grounds, was damning of the January 26 notification. One of its members, Estonia-based WaveCom, said it has invested in VMware for 15 years.

Kristian Liivak, CTO and founder of WaveCom AS, said a &quot;bulldozer named Broadcom&quot; has &quot;finally rolled over the remaining EU cloud service providers, terminating almost all VMware partner contracts.&quot;

&quot;This process had already taken place elsewhere in the world. In the United States, for example, only 19 providers reportedly remain out of thousands. Now the same approach has reached Europe.&quot;

Liivak said VMware, under Broadcom&#39;s ownership, has &quot;dismantled&quot; the partner network, beginning with &quot;predatory contractual terms and aggressive pricing changes.&quot; He claimed the &quot;long onboarding queues of enterprise customers disappeared almost overnight.&quot;

WaveCom previously started to build a virtualization stack based on Apache CloudStack and the EU-based Vates and Xen.

&quot;We still carry long-term government procurement obligations and enterprise contracts. It remains unclear how all customers will transition – whether they will move with us to the new platform or whether contractual challenges will arise due to the forced termination of the VMware ecosystem.&quot;

In its FAQ document, Broadcom covered what happens to customers managed by a non-renewing partner, saying: &quot;Non-renewing partners are encouraged to engage with retained VCSP partners to ensure a smooth transition for customers.&quot;

Liivak said: &quot;We will not disappear quietly into the night. And we will not hand our customers over to the remaining few providers, as implied by Broadcom&#39;s termination notice.&quot;

Another CSP source told us: &quot;This isn&#39;t partner management, it&#39;s market control, a forced consolidation that sidelines long-standing European partners in favor of a much narrower and more limiting ecosystem. Broadcom is deliberately shrinking the choice for customers who will end up paying the price through higher costs, less data sovereignty, compliance concerns, and ultimately reduced choice.&quot;

The Register has asked Broadcom to comment on how many CSPs will be joining its invite-only channel program, how many were not renewed and what if customers don&#39;t want to move to a new supplier.

&quot;Broadcom&#39;s strategy since closing the VMware acquisition has been to drive simplification, consistency, and innovation across the VMware ecosystem, including VMware Cloud Services Providers (VCSPs). Recent changes to this ecosystem are consistent with this strategy. Broadcom is focusing more and going deeper with the VCSPs who have demonstrated commitment to their cloud services built on VMware. This will enable us to deliver greater value, stronger execution, and a more streamlined experience for Broadcom&#39;s customers and enable an alternative competitive offering to the hyperscalers through our VCSP partners.&quot; ®

            <h2>January blues return as Ivanti coughs up exploited EPMM zero-days</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/ivanti_epmm_zero_days/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ivanti has patched two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in its Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) product that are already being exploited, continuing a grim run of January security incidents for enterprise IT vendors.

In January 2025, tens of thousands were urged to patch a Fortinet zero-day, while Ivanti customers were doing the same. There has been little change this year as Fortinet patches multiple single sign-on (SSO) flaws and Ivanti ships fixes for yet another pair of zero-days.

Tracked as CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, both bugs affect Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM). They&#39;re also both rated a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.8 and allow for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) – about as bad as it gets.

The security shop said in its advisory: &quot;We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.

&quot;This vulnerability does not impact any other Ivanti products, including any cloud products, such as Ivanti Neurons for MDM. Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) is a different product and also not impacted by these vulnerabilities. Customers using an Ivanti cloud product with Sentry are also not impacted by this vulnerability.&quot;

These kinds of RCE bugs can lead to all sorts of nastiness. Lateral movement across a given organization&#39;s network, config changes, and attackers making themselves admin are all possible. The vendor warned that it could grant access to certain data too.

Ivanti said that the types of information available could include basic personal information about the EPMM admin and device user, as well as information about mobile devices such as phone numbers and GPS locations.

Those looking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) are out of luck. Ivanti doesn&#39;t have any reliable ones due to the small number of impacted customers it knows about.

It does, however, have a technical analysis page, which includes more general information about how to detect potential exploits.

The Apache access log is a good place to start for threat hunters. Specifically, they should be looking at the In-House Application Distribution and the Android File Transfer Configuration features. Legitimate traffic leads to 200 HTTP response codes while potential exploit activity may result in 404s.

&quot;We recommend reviewing these and any other GET requests with parameters that have bash commands,&quot; Ivanti said.

This is not the first time in recent memory that EPMM has been hit by RCE bugs, and previous analyses have shown attackers tend to use two common methods of persistence. More often than not, it&#39;s introducing or modifying web shells, typically targeting error pages such as 401.jsp, the vendor said.

&quot;Any requests to these pages with POST methods or with parameters should be considered highly suspicious.&quot;

Ivanti also advised defenders to look out for unexpected WAR or JAR files being introduced to the system, as it could be a sign of attackers deploying reverse shell connections.

EPMM also does not usually make outbound network connections, so any signs of this in the firewall logs should be treated as a sign to investigate.

If a customer does find signs of compromise, Ivanti said it&#39;s best to just restore from backups – don&#39;t bother trying to clean the system – and then upgrade to the latest relevant version.

Alternatively, if going down the backup route isn&#39;t an option, Ivanti suggests building a replacement EPMM device and migrating data onto it.

Benjamin Harris, CEO at watchTowr, said that a &quot;wide range&quot; of its customers who have EPMM running belong to high-value industries, warning others to act fast.

He said: &quot;We knew January seemed too calm. Ivanti&#39;s EPMM solution, the center point of previous zero-day sagas, is once again receiving in-the-wild exploitation by seemingly capable and well-resourced threat actors.

&quot;CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 – unauthenticated RCE vulnerabilities within Ivanti&#39;s Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) – represent the worst of the worst, with threat actors actively compromising systems and deploying backdoors.

&quot;While patches are available from Ivanti, applying patches will not be enough. Threat actors have been exploiting these vulnerabilities as zero-days, and organizations that are, as of disclosure, exposing vulnerable instances to the internet must consider them compromised, tear down infrastructure, and instigate incident response processes.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lying means dying, at least for one falsehood-peddling government AI. A Microsoft-powered chatbot that New York City rolled out to help business owners answer frequently asked questions – but was often wrong – has been silenced as the city grapples with a $12 billion budget shortfall.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani said that, while the cash saved is only a fraction of what is needed to fund the budget, it was emblematic of how the last administration spent taxpayer money.

“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable, and was costing the administration around a half a million dollars,” Mamdani said in a Wednesday press conference. “That in and of itself is not something that can bridge this gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”

The chatbot was announced in October 2023 as part of then-Mayor Eric Adams&#39; New York City Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. It was meant to give business owners and entrepreneurs actionable and trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC business web pages and articles on topics such as compliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best practices to avoid violations and fines, Adams said at the time.

“For the first time New York City business and aspiring entrepreneurs will be able to direct their questions to an AI-powered chatbot rather than having to scan through webpage after webpage going into the blackhole of uncertainty about how to open a business, how to run a business, how to answer some of the basic questions,” he said during the announcement. “That is behind us. AI-generated answering is in front of us.”

However local news outlet The Markup tested the bot, it gave questioners the wrong answers, telling would-be landlords they did not have to accept tenants on housing assistance, and that they could set rents as high as they wished.

It said businesses could go cashless, even though the city council passed a measure in 2020 that required businesses to accept cash, and that it was ok for businesses to take employees&#39; tips and to conceal some funeral costs.

While the city did say in 2023 that the bot may hallucinate, the new administration credited the news outlet for alerting it to the problematic bot. The Register reached out to Microsoft for comment on Friday afternoon but did not receive an immediate response.

The New York bot isn’t the first one to run amok.

Air Canada used an AI-powered chatbot that gave the wrong advice about discounts, while other chatbots are accused of being complicit in harm to children, including suicide.

A Canadian tribunal found that Air Canada was bound by what its bot said. Earlier this month, Google and Character AI offered to settle lawsuits brought by families in Florida, Colorado, New York, and Texas whose children either died or were harmed after interactions with those bots. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/google_engineer_convicted_ai_secrets_china/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A former Google software engineer has been convicted of stealing AI hardware secrets from the company for the benefit of two China-based firms, one of which he founded. The second startup intended to use these secrets to market its technology to PRC-controlled organizations.

On Thursday, Linwei (&quot;Leon&quot;) Ding, 38, was convicted on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of trade secret theft for stealing confidential information related to Google&#39;s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and SmartNIC network interface cards.

&quot;We&#39;re grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,&quot; said Lee-Anne Mulholland, VP of regulatory affairs at Google, in a statement provided to The Register.

According to the second superseding indictment [PDF] filed in September 2025, Ding began working for Google on May 13, 2019. He was responsible for developing software that helps GPUs function more efficiently for machine learning applications at Google and Google Cloud. In that role, he had access to information Google deemed confidential.

Google employs various physical and network security measures, including security guards, cameras at building entrances, badge-based building access restrictions, guest registration and accompaniment requirements, network data loss prevention monitoring, device identification and authentication, and network activity logging.

The company checks physical and network access activity using both automated tools and human review to flag discrepancies like network access via an IP address that doesn&#39;t match the location of the employee&#39;s access badge.

These measures later helped reconstruct Ding&#39;s activities for investigators, but did not prevent or immediately detect his initial data theft. Google&#39;s spokesperson did not respond when asked whether the company has revised its security procedures and policies in the wake of this incident.

Around May 21, 2022, Ding began uploading more than 1,000 files containing trade secrets to his personal Google Cloud account.

&quot;Ding exfiltrated these files by copying data from the Google source files into the Apple Notes application on his Google-issued MacBook laptop,&quot; the indictment states. &quot;Ding then converted the Apple Notes into PDF files and uploaded them from the Google network into [his personal Google Cloud account]. This method helped Ding evade immediate detection by Google.&quot;

The following month, June 2022, Ding received a series of email messages from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Beijing Rongshu Lianzhi Technology Co., Ltd. (&quot;Rongshu&quot;), a technology startup in China focused on machine learning acceleration. The messages included a job offer as CTO for 100,000 RMB per month, which was worth about $14,800 or $177,600 annually at the time, plus an annual bonus and company stock.

Ding traveled to China on October 29, 2022, staying there until March 25, 2023, during which time he participated in investor meetings to raise money for Rongshu. By May 30, 2023, according to the indictment, he founded Shanghai Zhisuan Technology Co. Ltd. (&quot;Zhisuan&quot;) and took the role of CEO. The company aimed to develop a Cluster Management System for accelerating machine learning workloads.

Ding applied to get Zhisuan into a China-based business incubation program called MiraclePlus. The company was accepted in November 2023 and Ding then traveled to Beijing to pitch investors.

A document he distributed around that time in a Zhisuan WeChat group noted, &quot;we have experience with Google&#39;s ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it – and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China&#39;s national conditions.&quot; An internal Zhisuan memo referenced in the indictment indicates that the company expected to market its technology to PRC-controlled entities, including government agencies and academic institutions.

Google became aware of Ding&#39;s activities when he uploaded further files to a second personal Google Drive account while he was in China. On December 8, 2023, Ding offered reassurance to a Google investigator about his use of a personal account and signed a Self-Deletion Affidavit stating that he hasn&#39;t retained any Google information – while not disclosing his prior use of a personal account to upload Google files.

On December 14, 2023, Ding booked a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Beijing, scheduled to depart January 7, 2024. On December 26, 2023, he emailed his manager to resign from Google.

Three days later, Google found out that Ding had presented at the MiraclePlus conference as the CEO of Zhisuan. Company investigators then suspended Ding&#39;s network access, remotely locked his Google laptop, and began reviewing various security records.

They found surveillance footage that showed another employee scanning Ding&#39;s building access badge earlier that month to make it seem as if Ding was in the US during dates he was in China.

On January 4, 2024, Google security personnel took Ding&#39;s Google laptop and mobile device. Two days later, FBI investigators executed a search warrant. A grand jury indictment [PDF] was returned on March 5, 2024.

The court filings do not say whether the stolen trade secrets remain in the hands of PRC-affiliated individuals or companies. Google&#39;s spokesperson did not respond to a request to elaborate on the status of its proprietary information.

Ding&#39;s defense attorney filed a motion [PDF] to have the case dismissed, arguing that the government failed to allege that Ding ever handed the stolen secrets over to a foreign government entity; that he intended or knew his actions would benefit the PRC; or that the espionage was backed by the PRC.

Judge Chhabria subsequently rejected the defense motion, finding that the allegations and evidence were sufficient for a trial. He did however express skepticism of the government&#39;s theories that Ding&#39;s actions qualify as economic espionage under 18 U.S. Code § 1831 if they benefit China as a country, as opposed to the government of China.

According to the US Justice Department, trial evidence &quot;showed that Ding intended to benefit two entities controlled by the government of China by assisting with the development of an AI supercomputer and collaborating on the research and development of custom machine learning chips.&quot;

The jury found the government&#39;s case convincing and voted unanimously to convict on all fourteen counts. Ding faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of trade secret theft and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, subject to US Sentencing Guidelines and federal sentencing rules. ®

            <div id="article-text">Phone manufacturers are throwing everything they have at long-distance lenses in order to stand out.

This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on Android phones, follow Dominic Preston. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Ultra wasn’t the first phone to feature a periscopic telephoto lens — both Huawei and Oppo beat the Korean company to it — but it was the first in the US to make such a big deal about it. Almost all of Samsung’s marketing for the S20 Ultra centered on its so-called Space Zoom, its 5x optical folded periscope lens, capable of digitally zooming much further. Samsung even wrote “Space Zoom 100x” on the back of the phone itself, just in case you forgot.

That phone sparked a strong reaction from some. Many questioned why you’d ever need a camera that zoomed so far you could look inside the top windows of a skyscraper; some suggested it would only ever be used by perverts and voyeurs; others simply pointed out that almost every photo taken at 100x zoom sucked. Samsung and its competitors learned from some of that criticism and mostly stopped talking about 100x zoom, focusing on better quality shots from shorter distances in future marketing material.

What manufacturers didn’t stop was competing on telephoto cameras in the first place. Apple introduced its first iPhone with a 3x telephoto, the 13 Pro, in 2021 (though wouldn’t get a true periscope until another two years later). That same year, Google added a 48-megapixel, 4x periscopic telephoto to its Pixel 6 Pro, while Samsung jumped to a 10x telephoto on its S21 Ultra, a feat Huawei had already achieved a year earlier. Along with the longer zooms, companies began to add larger sensors, faster apertures, and more pixels in an effort to win the arms race.

Cameras have long been a source of fierce competition between smartphone manufacturers and for good reason: a 2023 YouGov survey found that more than half of US flagship phone buyers see photo quality as an important factor when picking a phone, with battery life the only feature to be ranked significantly more important. They’ve only become more important as other specs have become more homogenous. Almost every Android phone now offers a chipset from one of two manufacturers, similar RAM and storage specs, and a 120Hz OLED display somewhere between six and seven inches in size. Cameras offer room to be different, from outlandish lens module designs to high resolution sensors, with meaningful variation in photo quality, color science, and exposure.

Telephoto cameras have become a particular focus for the simple reason that most main cameras have gotten too good. An affordable Android handset will now take excellent photos in almost any lighting — even low light, once the ground for fierce OEM rivalries, is now essentially a solved problem. Selfie and ultrawide cameras are similarly capable, while typically attracting a lot less interest in the finer details of their photo quality. But people still associate telephotos with grainy images of far-off buildings, leaving plenty of room for manufacturers to find improvements and make their mark.

Phone manufacturers are now turning to more and more extravagant hardware setups in order to gain an advantage.

Vivo has chased higher resolutions, introducing a 200-megapixel telephoto in its X100 Ultra, since adopted by Honor, Xiaomi, and more. Samsung is one of several brands to include two telephoto lenses on a single phone, each offering a different zoom. Sony tried to one-up the competition with continuous optical zoom on its Xperia 1 IV. Xiaomi just resurrected that idea for its 17 Ultra, going a step further by introducing a rotatable zoom ring on the camera island. Last year’s Huawei Pura 80 Ultra put two telephoto lenses on top of a single sensor, with a movable prism to direct the light from the appropriate lens, allowing space for a larger sensor than other phones.

The latest wave of competition has stepped beyond the phone itself. Vivo was first to offer a telephoto extender for its X200 Ultra, an add-on lens that mounts onto the phone with the help of a special case, producing 8.7x optical zoom from a lens the length of a Coke can. Predictably enough, others followed suit, with Oppo and Honor among the companies offering near-identical extender lenses — though a handful of third-party manufacturers have offered similar add-on lenses for years.

Increasingly, manufacturers have taken to heart that longer isn’t always better. Recent Ultra flagships from Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi have dropped back to shorter 3-4x optical zooms, distances that make them practical choices for portrait photos and product shots. Larger sensors and faster apertures mean they capture more light than older telephotos, perform better at night, and produce natural bokeh without a dedicated portrait mode. When I’m using one of these phones, I now find myself shooting the overwhelming majority of photos using the telephoto cameras, which tend to offer more attractive framing and depth to shots than the flat, wide main cameras. Telephotos aren’t only better than ever — they’re increasingly the best cameras on a phone, period.

For now, expect the arms race to continue. We’ll likely see imitators of Xiaomi’s updated take on continuous zoom and Huawei’s alternating lenses, while more traditional telephotos keep getting bigger sensors and wider apertures. There’ll be more add-on lenses, likely getting longer, larger, and probably with their own continuous zoom capabilities too.

One obvious growth area is AI zoom. Smartphones have used machine learning to enhance digital zoom for years, but we’re now seeing generative AI applied for the same effect, most notably in the Pixel 10 series’ Pro Res Zoom. It raises the usual questions around what a photo actually is, with Google smartly disabling the feature when faces are in frame, heading some problems off at the pass. Still, with the RAM crisis driving costs up across the board, expect manufacturers to jump at new ways to enhance photos with software, rather than ever more expensive hardware components.

Low light photos are still one area where many telephotos can’t compete with main cameras. Sensors and apertures are smaller, and stabilization is trickier for the delicate periscopic setups, making it harder to get results when the light gets low. Serious improvement has been made in the last year or two though, and I expect it to continue.

After that, all bets are off. We’re getting close to the point of diminishing returns on telephoto lenses, at least outside of the 100x zoom photos that few photographers ever actually take. Component costs mean Ultra phone telephotos still have a real edge over those in regular flagships or cheaper phones, but the moment that changes, manufacturers will have to find a new race to run.

He says the company still plans to make a “huge” investment in the ChatGPT maker.

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang denied reports that he was unhappy with OpenAI and said his company still planned to make a “huge” investment in the ChatGPT firm. NVIDIA announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, but recently, there have been suggestions that the deal might not happen. While Huang told reporters in Taipei that it was “nonsense” to say he was unhappy with OpenAI, when asked if Nvidia would be investing over $100 billion, he replied, “No, nothing like that.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time and I really love working with Sam,” he said, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

“Sam is closing the round (of investment) and we will absolutely be involved,” Huang added. “We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.”

            <div id="article-text">Scenes from the general strike in Minneapolis.

It was too cold to take off my mittens and check Google Maps so I put my faith in the trickle of bundled-up people ahead of me. All of them were carrying signs and wearing whistles around their necks on top of layers and layers of winter clothing. At first there were dozens of us walking toward Government Plaza, across the street from Minneapolis City Hall, and within a block it was hundreds. By the time I arrived it was thousands. Some reports said five to ten thousand, but on the ground, it felt like a single vibrating mass that was too large to count.

I made my way through the throng, repeating “excuse me” and “pardon me” despite the din because the people here are above all else unfailingly polite. Someone offered me a “Fuck ICE“ pin. Someone else offered me a chocolate-chip cookie. Another offered me a red vuvuzela. All three declined to be named or interviewed.

Friday, January 30 was the second general strike in the Twin Cities since federal immigration officers killed Alex Pretti. This one was reportedly organized by Somali and Black student groups at the University of Minnesota. Unlike the first strike, held last week and endorsed by local unions, this Friday’s was more hastily organized than the first economic blackout. I heard murmurs of lower turnout this time around, which was difficult to square with the fact that the plaza was so crowded that I didn’t understand how more people could possibly fit. And yet Minnesotans kept coming. The light-rail car pulled in and through the windows I saw the people inside were standing shoulder to shoulder, and they poured out and somehow filled space that wasn’t there.

They chanted: “No more Minnesota nice, Minneapolis will strike.”

Unlike the ongoing protests outside the Whipple Federal Building, the staging area from which ICE agents depart in unmarked cars to hunt down immigrants, the mood at the City Hall rally was almost jubilant, despite the under-current of outrage and terror that is present everywhere here. At Whipple, people jeer and yell at federal agents and local sheriff’s deputies alike, and their taunts are often met with flash bangs and pepper spray. Today, there appeared to be no such danger at the City Hall rally, but if the people of Minneapolis have learned anything over the past few weeks, it’s that danger lurks around every corner. You can be sitting in your car and be killed by a federal agent. You can be doing ICE watch and be killed by a federal agent. You can be protesting that killing and be arrested by federal agents. You can be walking or driving to work and be snatched by a federal agent. You can blow a whistle to alert your neighbors that federal agents are snatching someone off the street, and you’ll end up, at the very least, pepper sprayed by a federal agent. Medics milled about, prepared for the worst.

Helicopters circled overhead. Volunteer marshals in neon vests, stationed at nearly every entrance and street corner, directed the crowd. One warned me about the ice; I didn’t hear her and slipped, but a woman behind me caught my fall.

The company claims it’s a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly alternative to land-based centers.

SpaceX filed a request with the FCC on Friday seeking approval to put a constellation of 1 million data center satellites into orbit. While the FCC is unlikely to approve a network that expansive, SpaceX’s strategy has been to request approval for unrealistically large numbers of satellites as a starting point for negotiations.

The filing proposes establishing a network of solar-powered data centers in low Earth orbit that communicate with one another via lasers. The filling speaks of the constellation in ambitious sci-fi terms, calling it a “first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization — one that can harness the Sun’s full power.”

Even if just a small fraction of those 1 million satellites wind up in orbit, it would mark a significant increase in the number of man-made objects in space. The European Space Agency estimates there are around 15,000 satellites orbiting the Earth at the moment, and the majority are Starlink. (Over 9,600 of them, according to Johnathan’s Space Report.)

When experts are already concerned about the abundance of space junk and potential for orbital collisions, such an explosion of objects in orbit would seem ill-advised. But SpaceX argues that the orbital data centers would be a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to land-based centers that form the backbone of the growing AI industry. Instead of syphoning water from communities, polluting groundwater, and driving up electricity bills, orbital data centers would be able to radiate heat into the vacuum of space and rely almost exclusively on real-time solar power and limited batteries.

The backlash against data centers has been growing, and communities are increasingly winning their battles to block their construction. So it’s no surprise that the biggest names in AI are turning their attention to one of the few places where there isn’t a community to upset.

Correction January 31st: An earlier version of this article stated that there were over 11,000 Starlink satellites in orbit. That number was the total launched, including satellites that had been decommissioned. This has been corrected to reflect how many Starlink satellites are currently active in orbit.

Happy Saturday, folks! After a few weeks of middling deals, we’re starting see things pick up. Some of our favorite deals of the holiday season have returned in some fashion, making now a great time to pick up deal stalwarts like the AirPods 4 with ANC or Google’s TV Streamer (4K). We also stumbled upon a deal that knocks $5 off a pair of Lego Roses, as well as another that lets both new and returning subscribers snag a month of Apple TV Plus, completely free of charge.

If you can afford it, I highly recommend the AirPods Pro 3, which are on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now for $199 ($50 off). However, if you’re an Apple user looking to save some cash, the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation make for a surprisingly good alternative, especially since they’re on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $119 — about $20 shy of the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.

Despite their open-style design, the AirPods 4 with ANC offer the best sound of any AirPods to date (save the Pro models). The noise cancellation is remarkably effective at lowering the volume of the outside world, and because they’re an Apple product, they’re loaded with all the usual ecosystem tricks. That means you’ll get support for head-tracking spatial audio, automatic device switching, and live translation courtesy of iOS 26. The ANC also packs a few Pro-level features, including wireless charging and a built-in speaker on the charging case that lets you track it via Apple’s Find My app.

Ready or not, Valentine’s Day is right around the corner. Per usual, we’ll be publishing several gift guides in the run-up to the main event on Sunday, February 14th; however, if you want to get a head start on shopping for your supposed sweetheart, Lego’s Roses are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Target for around $9.91 (about $5 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Lego does sell more robust floral sets — hell, you can currently buy a dozen stems for around $55 — but this 120-piece kit feels like a more subtle surprise. Just pair it with an actual vase, and voila: instant brownie points.

These days, most TVs are equipped with a way to access Netflix, HBO Max, and a laundry list of other streaming apps. That said, a dedicated device like Google’s TV Streamer (4K) — which is now available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Google for $79.99 ($20 off), nearly matching its all-time low— can provide better customization, faster performance, and more advanced search functionality than many 4K TVs.

Google’s speedy Chromecast follow-up supports both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with a handy Find My feature that lets you locate the remote when it inevitably falls between your couch cushions. It can also cobble together recommendations from across streaming services, and thanks to its built-in support for both Matter and Thread, you can leverage it as a smart home hub, making it easy to control your lights or view livestreams from connected cameras. We just wish it weren’t limited to Wi-Fi 5, even if the built-in ethernet port does help.

In case you weren’t aware, Apple TV Plus has basically become the streaming service if you’re a sci-fi fan, with recent standouts like Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus further cementing its status in recent months. Thankfully, if you hadn’t had an opportunity to dig into the streamer’s movie and TV catalog, both new and qualified returning subscribers can currently sign up for a free 30-day trial for a limited time.

If you’re not into interstellar travel or hive mind antics, rest assured that you have other options. The second season of the high-stakes wine drama Drops of God and the third season of Shrinking — an excellent comedy starring Jason Segel — are now underway, and the next season of Ted Lasso is (finally) set to premiere this summer after a three-year absence. Just be sure to cancel your membership before the trial period ends; otherwise, it will renew at the current rate of $12.99 a month.

The game is inspired by the classics, but it has a perspective-shifting twist.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

It’s no secret that Cassette Boy is inspired by the classics. It’s a top-down adventure game in the vein of a retro Legend of Zelda, while your home base is a small town like in an older Pokémon game, complete with a mom who is constantly wishing you well. The game’s blocky 3D graphics evoke Minecraft, and you save at campfires that reset the world, like a FromSoft game. Everything in Cassette Boy even has a green tint that reminds me of playing games on my original Game Boy. But despite all of the clear influences, it still feels unique: underneath that charming exterior, Cassette Boy is a game filled with clever puzzles that forced me to use my head in ways I haven’t before.

The game’s main mechanic revolves around an idea “inspired by” quantum mechanics: if you can’t see something in the game, it ceases to “exist” and remains in an essentially frozen state from the moment it went off-screen. If you push a block behind a wall, it’s not “there” anymore, and you can walk behind that wall without being impeded by the box. If an enemy goes fully behind a wall, it becomes invisible, will stop moving, and can’t damage you. Since it doesn’t exist, you also can’t damage it. The game also lets you rotate the camera to eight different points; imagine it’s on a compass, and with a tap of a shoulder button, you can rotate it to the north “point,” then northwest, then east, etc. So, with that hidden enemy, if you turn the camera so that it’s not behind the wall, it “reappears” and becomes a physical being again.

Cassette Boy then sets up a bunch of puzzles that force you to mess with perspective to overcome obstacles. Early on, you’ll come across a button that makes a platform appear on a river when the button is pressed down, and the button is next to a boulder. Everyone who has played a Zelda game knows that the usual solution would be to move the boulder to keep the button down. But you can’t pick up the boulder in Cassette Boy; instead, the solution is to step on the button and then turn the camera so that the boulder entirely hides the pressed-down button. That way, the button becomes frozen while pressed down, allowing you to hop on the platform to get to the other side of the river.

In addition to moving the camera, you get tools like a bow and arrow to hit switches and enemies from a distance and cassette tapes that give you powers to see bombable walls or shrink you down. When it all comes together, Cassette Boy is really satisfying: when I was in the zone, I couldn’t wait to pick apart every new room to work through puzzles and search for hidden treasures tucked away out of sight. There are also clever battles against giant, blocky bosses, all to earn moon fragments (the main MacGuffin you’re tasked to find).

Sometimes, though, Cassette Boy can be obtuse. There are no maps to refer to. You often have to talk to the exact right person at the exact right time to move the main quest forward, and you don’t have much of an indication of who that might be except for a speech bubble over their heads. After you collect a moon fragment, the game will send you back to the main town but won’t tell you where to go, so I often got frustrated having to seek out all of the townspeople over and over again. Some of the puzzles also totally stumped me, and I usually had a full-game walkthrough open during my nearly eight-hour playthrough so that I could get hints on how to progress next.

But I also think all that obtuseness is by design, and it harkens back to the game’s inspirations. With older Zelda and Pokémon games, I have fond memories of wandering around, getting lost, and eventually finding my way back on course with a sigh of relief. With all the time I spent struggling, I was forced to learn my way around those worlds, and now I can recall how to get through the toughest parts of those games even though I haven’t played them for years. (Even the developers of Breath of the Wild think that getting lost can be a “very positive thing.”)

Cassette Boy evokes that old-school spirit. Even when it frustrated me, I usually didn’t mind the struggle, and it helped me learn my way around. Usually, I realized that finding the right way forward just required a new perspective.

Cassette Boy is now available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131945/inside-the-marketplace-powering-bespoke-ai-deepfakes-of-real-women/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.)

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

DHS is using Google and Adobe AI to make videos

The news: The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

Why it matters: It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

Therapists are secretly using ChatGPT. Clients are triggered.Declan would never have found out his therapist was using ChatGPT had it not been for a technical mishap. The connection was patchy during one of their online sessions, so Declan suggested they turn off their video feeds. Instead, his therapist began inadvertently sharing his screen.For the rest of the session, Declan was privy to a real-time stream of ChatGPT analysis rippling across his therapist’s screen, who was taking what Declan was saying, putting it into ChatGPT, and then parroting its answers.But Declan is not alone. In fact, a growing number of people are reporting receiving AI-generated communiqués from their therapists. Clients’ trust and privacy are being abandoned in the process. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">For the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

What AI “remembers” about you is privacy’s next frontier

—Miranda Bogen, director of the AI Governance Lab at the Center for Democracy & Technology, & Ruchika Joshi, fellow at the Center for Democracy & Technology specializing in AI safety and governance

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather? Read the full story.

The flawed logic of rushing out extreme climate solutionsEarly in 2022, entrepreneur Luke Iseman says, he released a pair of sulfur dioxide–filled weather balloons from Mexico’s Baja California peninsula, in the hope that they’d burst miles above Earth.It was a trivial act in itself, effectively a tiny, DIY act of solar geoengineering, the controversial proposal that the world could counteract climate change by releasing particles that reflect more sunlight back into space.Entrepreneurs like Iseman invoke the stark dangers of climate change to explain why they do what they do—even if they don’t know how effective their interventions are. But experts say that urgency doesn’t create a social license to ignore the underlying dangers or leapfrog the scientific process. Read the full story.—James Temple

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.
