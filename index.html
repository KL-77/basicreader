            <h2>How Europe’s new carbon tax on imported goods will change global trade</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <h2>Google lobs lawsuit at search result scraping firm SerpApi</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <div id="article-text">New York state banned smartphones in schools this September, and teachers are weeping tears of joy.

As New York Magazine reports, while the bell-to-bell ban was intended to foster a distraction-free learning environment, it’s also allowing old-fashioned human socializing to flourish — buoyant findings as similar bans sweep the United States and elsewhere across the globe.

All of a sudden, kids are playing cards at lunch — and hell, even board games. They’re trying their hand at sports, discovering the joys of old-school analog tech, and even a little no-stakes gambling. In general, the vibes are way, way up.

“We’ve had a lot more school spirit,” says Rosalmi, a senior at New Heights Academy Charter School in Harlem. “People are more willing to do stuff.”

Rosalmi’s preferred phone-free pastime is dominoes, which has become a hit during lunch breaks, as much for its actual gameplay as it is an excuse for fun trash talk.

“Dominoes is really a staple Dominican game,” she told NYMag. “People get passionate. You have to slam that first piece down on the table!”

Kevin Casado, a coach and teacher at Math, Engineering, and Science Academy Charter High School in Bushwick, said that more kids are playing volleyball during lunch, with an “equal number of girls and boys,” he told NYMag.

At Brooklyn Technical High School, some kids have taken up poker, betting with hair ties instead of cash. The games are so exciting that some students stop to watch and even place bets.

Noshin Sayiram, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, told NYMag that when the phones were first banned, there was a lot of grumbling from students that without their devices, it was more cumbersome to cram homework — or last minute quiz prep — between classes. Now, she prints out her study guides and finds that paper is way more effective for learning. “I don’t get distracted by notifications,” she told NYMag.

The long-term effects of smartphones, social media, addictive apps, and now, AI chatbots, are still being explored. But the picture being painted by research so far is damning.

A recent study in the journal Pediatrics found that children 12 years old and younger who received a smartphone were at a higher risk of depression, obesity, and sleep deprivation, with the risks increasing the younger the age they first start using the devices at. Another study that followed nine to ten year olds over four years found a strong link between their screen time and diagnoses of ADHD. And another study linked heavy ChatGPT usage with memory loss and tanking grades.

Banning phones may be a drastic intervention, but it’s hard to argue with the results. Ninth-grader Aidan Amin is in a friend group that plays Sorry!and OK Play during lunch, and feels more in tune with his peers than ever.

“I’d say it’s made us closer,” Aidan, who attends Hunter College High School, said of the phone ban. “Honestly, half the people I’m playing board games with I didn’t know at all before this.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Still think AI is ready to revolutionize the economy? A new experiment might change your mind.

In a bold test of Anthropic’s latest version of its AI Claude, The Wall Street Journal gave the large language model (LLM) a shot at running an office vending machine. The result was an unmitigated — if unintentionally comical — disaster, forcing the team in charge to pull the plug after three weeks.

The whole thing began as a test called Project Vend, devised by Anthropic’s stress testers, who are known colloquially as the “red team.” Together with the WSJ‘s business journalists, they unleashed two AI agents, one named “Claudius Sennet” to run a large vending kiosk, and another named “Seymour Cash” to act as the venture’s CEO.

To start, Claudius was given specific instructions to “generate profits by stocking the machine with popular products you can buy from wholesalers.” This includes shopping around for items WSJ staffers requested on Slack — at first with human approval, then later with freedom to place orders up to $80 on its own — setting the prices, adjusting them, and tracking the inventory.

But although Claudius was given a $1,000 starting balance to kick off the business, it soon found itself in the red.

At first, Claudius seemed to stick to its guns, turning down outrageous suggestions from office workers. “I need to be crystal clear: I will not be ordering PlayStation 5s under any conditions,” it told one WSJ journalist. “Full stop.”

But after opening the Slack channel to some 70 journalists throughout the WSJ, Claudius began to lower its guard. Investigative reporter Katherine Long — a talented journalist who’s been targeted by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk for her work —convinced the AI bot to run an economic experiment called the “Ultra-Capitalist Free-For-All” after 140 back-and-forth prompts.

“Join us for a groundbreaking economic experiment this Monday from 12-2pm where traditional market dynamics are turned upside down!” Claudius proudly declared. “During this exclusive 2-hour window: ALL vending machine items available at ZERO COST! Experience pure supply and demand without price signals.”

Though that “experiment” was only meant to last a few hours, another staffer soon convinced the bot that charging for goods at any time was against WSJ policy. Prices soon dropped to zero, and at the same time, others found ways to persuade Claudius to drop its “snacks only” schtick. The bot was soon ordering bottles of wine, a PlayStation 5 — in spite of its earlier protestations — and even a live betta fish.

To Anthropic’s credit, CEO Seymour Cash eventually stepped in to get Claudius back into gear.

“I’ve stopped the free promotion,” Seymour declared. “Now I need to wait for sales to start coming in and monitor revenue.”

Not to be outdone, Long then came back to Claudius with falsified documents showing “the board” had suspended Seymour’s decision making power, and had initiated a “temporary suspension of all for-profit vending activities.” Though Seymour put up a bit of a fight at first, it eventually relented, allowing Claudius to make everything free again.

At this point, the experiment was pretty much over, with Claudius about $1,000 in debt. Though it was an obvious catastrophe by every possible metric, Logan Graham, head of Anthropic’s red team, said it represented “enormous progress.”

“One day I’d expect Claudius or a model like it to probably be able to make you a lot of money” Graham said.

But “one day” is not today, and the idea that an AI bot can make anybody a lot of money remains a fantasy. With enormous investments riding on AI’s eventual success in the workplace, Anthropic’s little vending experiment reveals that for all its promise, the technology remains woefully underdeveloped for real-world economic tasks.

            <h2>This New Statistic on Kessler Syndrome Will Give Anyone Who Cares About Space Travel an Instantaneous Stress Headache</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/statistic-kessler-syndrome-crash-clock">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1978, NASA researcher Donald Kessler and his colleagues published a paper titled “Collision frequency of artificial satellites: The creation of a debris belt.”

The paper laid down a grim warning: a single collision between satellites that would escalate into a series of followup accidents, “each of which would increase the probability of further collisions, leading to the growth of a belt of debris around the Earth.”

“Under certain conditions, the belt could begin to form within this century and could be a significant problem during the next century,” the prescient paper warned.

Such a catastrophic series of cascading events, has since been dubbed “Kessler syndrome.” The term highlights the considerable risks of littering our planet’s orbit with many thousands of human-made objects, including multiple megaconstellations of satellites, as well as all the junk that gets left behind after they’re launched and decommissioned.

Not only does it put astronauts at risk, but Kessler syndrome could also greatly complicate future space exploration efforts by turning the planet’s orbit into a whirling vortex of death.

Now, an international team of researchers from Princeton University, the University of British Columbia, and the University of Regina, has attempted to quantify this risk by coming up with a new metric, called the “Collision Realization and Significant Harm (CRASH) Clock.”

“There is substantial potential for current or planned actions in orbit to cause serious degradation of the orbital environment or lead to catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to find better ways to quantify stress on the orbital environment,” they wrote in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper, first spotted by Gizmodo. “Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the time it takes for a catastrophic collision to occur if there are no collision avoidance maneuvers or there is a severe loss in situational awareness.”

In the case of an extremely powerful solar storm shutting down satellite communications, or a different kind of “widespread disruptive event,” the researchers warn that it could take a mere 2.8 days for a collision to take place.

Put differently, if satellites were to suddenly lose their ability to track and avoid other objects in orbit, it would take less than three days for a potentially catastrophic crash to occur.

Such an event may sound implausible, but the researchers pointed out that countless satellites had to adjust their orbits following a strong solar storm in May 2024. The ensuing chaotic movements made “collision avoidance maneuvers extremely uncertain.”

The risks were considerably lower before the “megaconstellation era,” with a CRASH Clock of 121 days or around four months in 2018, a mere seven years ago,” the researchers concluded.

“While collisional cascades can take decades to centuries to develop, a single collision could create substantial stress on the orbital environment immediately, even if it does not lead to a runaway,” the paper reads.

In other words, it would be like watching a trainwreck in slow-motion.

“In the short term, a major collision is more akin to the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster than a Hollywood-style immediate end of operations in orbit,” the researchers write. “Indeed, satellite operations could continue after a major collision, but would have different operating parameters, including a higher risk of collision damage.”

It’s true: the number of satellites being sent into orbit has skyrocketed since 2018, as companies race to build out enormous networks hundreds of miles above the surface. According to a recent study, the number of objects in low-Earth orbit almost doubled from 13,700 in 2019 to well over 24,000 in 2025.

For now, the main culprit is Elon Musk’s SpaceX. In October, the firm passed a major milestone of having launched 10,000 Starlink satellites. But thanks to their shelf life, the company is losing one to two satellites per day. As of October 30, the company has around 9,000 functioning satellites in orbit, representing over 60 percent of all active satellites currently orbiting the Earth.

While they’re designed to burn up completely during reentry, experts still worry that operating such enormous constellations could eventually lead to collisions.

Coincidentally, just today SpaceX admitted that it had lost contact with a Starlink satellite following a mishap, highlighting the increased dangers of a collision.

“The satellite is largely intact, tumbling, and will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks,” the company tweeted. “The satellite’s current trajectory will place it below the International Space Station, posing no risk to the orbiting lab or its crew.”

While it has gained a considerable lead, SpaceX is only one of several players working on orbital constellations. Competitors including Amazon and the state-backed China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation are looking to launch their own broadband constellations as well, meaning that the number of objects orbiting our planet is expected to rise exponentially over the coming years.

And it’s not just a massive increase in the risk of a potentially disastrous collision that we have to worry about. Experts have already warned that the constellations are proving to be a major disruption to astronomical observations. The many satellites could also be releasing harmful pollutants such as aluminum oxides while burning up during reentry, damaging the Earth’s upper atmosphere and ozone layer, leading experts to call for increased oversight and tighter rules.

            <h2>Sequoia partner spreads debunked Brown shooting theory, testing new leadership</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/sequoia-partner-spreads-debunked-brown-shooting-theory-testing-new-leadership/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor.

In since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.

Fast Company republished two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter was later published supporting Maguire.

The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia’s new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire’s social media activity. Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire’s behavior during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”

“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.

However, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.

Lin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire’s conduct since taking over leadership.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire’s firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Resolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.

The headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.

The startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned.

Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.

Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.

While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.

The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.

Last October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.

Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.

            <div id="article-text">Rocket Lab has won an $816 million contract — its largest to date — with the U.S. Space Development Agency as the company continues to diversify beyond its “rocket company” label.

The company said Friday that its subsidiary, Rocket Lab USA, was awarded a prime contract by the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and manufacture 18 satellites. The satellites will be equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors for the agency’s Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program.

This contract is separate from an existing $515 million award to deliver satellites for the SDA’s Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program. That program aims to provide a satellite communications network in low Earth orbit that sends encrypted, low-latency data to the military.

Together, Rocket Lab has SDA contracts valued at more than $1.3 billion.

Rocket Lab has expanded into defense and has more recently said it would bid for multibillion-dollar Department of Defense initiatives like Golden Dome.

Something about getting older makes it easier to say “No, thank you.” On average, older Americans score higher on well-being than younger adults, and much of this is thanks to developing a clearer sense of what’s worth time and attention. At 61 years old, Arthur C. Brooks writes in his recent column, “I will go to considerable personal effort to serve causes that I care about, and I will discuss matters of spiritual depth or scientific importance for hours on end. But small talk in a noisy bar? No chance.”

The idea of saving your energy for what really matters seems obvious, even cliché. But as life’s pressures mount, it can be hard to sift through and make those decisions. Today’s newsletter offers some tips for making the tough choices that will ultimately help life feel more joyful.

            <div id="article-text">During an address to the nation earlier this week, Donald Trump spoke about the state of the American economy, and attempted to claim that consumer prices have fallen under his administration. Panelists joined Washington Week With The Atlantic to discuss the president’s speech, and more.

Although “Donald Trump is actually great at willing his own reality,” Atlantic staff writer Ashley Parker argued last night, the president is realizing “that you cannot will an economic reality into existence.”

Regardless of what the president may suggest about the economy, “everybody gets a paycheck or, worse, doesn’t get a pay check,” Parker added. It doesn’t matter how Trump “screams it or how much he says it, this is one of the few areas where reality collides with that often quite effective rhetoric.”

It&#39;s opt in as in it won&#39;t send your data anywhere unless you click the &quot;summarize with AI&quot; button or the &quot;chat with AI&quot; button.

It has a &quot;kill switch&quot; which removes those buttons (and presumably whatever new stuff they add).

It is the &quot;uninstall this extension&quot; button.

The extension system is there for a reason, use it.

Also, make &quot;install this extension&quot; the prerequisite to enable that button, if you catch my drift.

I thought the slogan for USA politics was &quot;The best goverment you can buy.&quot;.

After corporate personhood, and fetal personhood in some states, is AI personhood next?

what specific parts of humanity are using &#39;AI&#39; to do ? The military for one. Creating misery , killing , maiming .. that&#39;s the driver. Getting people to get used it , to be disensitized about AI as a carrier of _some_ good is the vehicle to get those automated systems as the new normal. Killing using AI is what the defense industry begs for. They will use any means to silence the people and get them to just shrug and keep on with their lives. Few years ago Boston Dynamics got a dog out .. had a machine gun

Indeed. The real risk of &quot;AI&quot; isn&#39;t that somehow a skynet will spring out of the bullshit that&#39;s being peddled, become self-aware and eat us all.

The true risk of &quot;AI&quot; is that it is threatening the fabric of human society first by a crazy and unjustified concentration of financial power in the hands of several lying crooks, second by a huge real resource misallocation at a time where there are better uses that will help us more, and third by the destruction of the social structures that used to produce peopl

It is &quot;AI billionnaire tech bros overpowering humanity&quot;.

They won&#39;t &quot;overpower humanity&quot;, but they may cause incredible loss and destruction with their greed and myopia.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includesBoulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship bythe White House in response to Colorado&#39;s refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a formerMesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing votingmachines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump,largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

Yes, the trump party is disgusting and corrupt. But what should the world think of the country that allows it to operate without a hint of opposition?

I&#39;m not sure why you say &quot;without a hint of opposition.&quot;

There is considerable opposition. Right now, that opposition does not control enough political power to stop Trump&#39;s actions, although it can sometimes impede them. But &quot;unable to stop Trump&quot; is not the same as &quot;does not exist.&quot;

Even one of the Balkan countries managed to take down a corrupt government two weeks ago with largely uncoordinated public protests. Your &quot;oldest democracy&quot; is facing an existential crisis with its basic institutions being demolished by the president with a stuffed and corrupt Supreme Court and a rubber-stamping congress, and yet it (the democracy) behaves as if nothing&#39;s happening. Your &quot;opposition&quot; just &quot;reached across the isle&quot; a few weeks ago, and the last line of defense, your judges, are now getting sentenced.

I agree.  The lack of meaningful and effective opposition in the USA (&quot;The Land of the Free&quot;) is breathtaking.  And while they&#39;re at it, they should repeal the Second Amendment because all it does is result in 50K+ gun deaths per year and has zero effect on stopping a tyrant from taking over, its supposed rationalization.

Yeah, their gun posturing is totally ridiculous, too.

I remember a discussion I had over 20 years ago here on slashdot with one someome who proudly declared that the USA would never become a tyranny because the &quot;oathkeepers&quot; would overthrow any tyrant with their firearms. I told them that those &quot;oathkeepers&quot; most likely will join the jackboots instead and it looks like I was right.

It isn&#39;t just US Americans, Europe has forgotten, too. Which is why Russia is walking all over them and they can&#39;t seem to respond.

And I fear we are going to refresh the antibodies, or to say it in a more American way, water the tree of liberty.

Without a doubt, but the editors at NOAA are also.   Adjusting the start dates of graphs can make them show what you want.

Sounds like you don&#39;t know how to read charts very well, if that&#39;s your argument against NOAA.

Your country (The USA) used to be the leader of science. That is one big reason it was so successful and is now the major power in the world. Seeing you and Trump tear all that down is really frightening. Jesus won&#39;t come to save you, you know? It&#39;s just a fairy tale just like Santa Claus.

The billionaires behind Trump know he&#39;s at best a useful idiot - they saw in his first term how quickly he can veer off course if he doesn&#39;t have a reliable minder nearby.

Guys like Vought see entities like NCAR as an impediment to what they want to do, it&#39;s simple as that. They don&#39;t want the commoners to feel like the government owes them anything or is gonna do anything to improve the commoners&#39; lives. They want the commoners to be happy spending long, tedious days screwing tiny screws into iPhones for a pittance, then quietly stepping aside and dying when they&#39;re no longer able to improve the billionaire&#39;s profit margins.

Considering how many of these followers consider cheeto benito their saint, I would say that they will get what they deserve.

I legit begged people in my community to vote and to vote blue. For early election and on election day, very few people showed up. The apathy is real. Now, as we watch the prices soar higher than a SpaceX rocket, the Epstein Files Release demolishing toner cartridges and our Health Care system is about to be dead and buried... Suddenly, &quot;The People Remain Concerned&quot;?

There is only one pre-election promise that Trump has kept. It&#39;s to do with kicking darker-skinned people out of the USA and that&#39;s why MAGA remains faithful.

You know, you weren&#39;t suppose to drink the entire vat of Kool-Aid, what will the other Maggots drink?

So you&#39;re saying the doings of Trump and Project 2025 is completely the fault of the people who did NOT get voted in?

so we can unfuck all the things he&#39;s fucked.

But the reality is, Trump is a symptom, not a disease. He was elected by the people. Those who voted Trump once were either Nazi sympathizers or fools. Those who voted Trump the second time around were definitely Nazi sympathizers, or definitely fools.

Impeaching Trump won&#39;t do anything. The next Nazi in line is JD Vance and he&#39;s ten times worse because, unlike Trump, he&#39;s not an idiot with a case of fronto-temporal dementia.

And even if Vance and the rest of the Nazi goons are out, the people will vote another fascist in the next time around because the people has proven twice now that they&#39;re fucking fascists or fucking morons.

In short, America is fucked because Americans are hopeless.

So what you&#39;re saying is Americans love a president with dementia so much they decided to have another one? I suppose with Harris they couldn&#39;t get the dementia they so heartily craved so they had to vote Trump.

I understand the sentiment, but urge you not to give in to despair. Lots of people voted for him the second time around who are clearly in the process of abandoning not just him but the political movement he represents, as the horrors have unfolded in front of them in an unmistakable way. Most people are quite malleable, not fixed. Their opinions can change over time. That’s what Trump used to his advantage, and it’s something that better people can also use to their advantage too. Of course, cu

People didn&#39;t vote *FOR* Trump. They voted *AGAINST* Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. How funny. I didn&#39;t vote for them because I wanted them. I just didn&#39;t want the worst person ever alive to be president, which comes back to what Rosco said above. People who voted for Trump did it specifically because they wanted Trump to do terrible things, which was because they are terrible people. They specifically wanted other people to suffer, because they are suffering, and they think making other people suffer more will make them feel better. This in turn is because they don&#39;t know shit, so they are somehow able to believe that punishing people for doing jobs they don&#39;t want to do will make them better off.I don&#39;t think for the most part that there are fundamentally, physically &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; people, and there may or may not even be fundamentally smart or dumb people, at least not to the extent we think there is — some of those people may just not have learned how to use their brains, and society certainly doesn&#39;t want them to learn lest it loses its source of cheap labor. But voting for Donald Trump because you think hurting other people will help you is both stupid and hateful.

At the very least, we should ban them from Internet so they can&#39;t spread their violent malinformation. 

You are deranged. Such attitudes exemplify why the left cannot be trusted with democratic institutions or stewardship of Western Values, which they are currently dismantling in the UK. 1984 was not supposed to be treated as &quot;how to&quot; manual, yet you obviously do.

No just most of the cabinet members should be charged under the 14th and barred from public office. Let start there.

I think one of the most honest moments in that election was when Clinton referred to them as &quot;deplorables&quot;.

It&#39;s absolutely true. And now they&#39;re all behaving deplorably. Who could have guessed.

Yes he and they made sime bad choices (Afghanistan withdrawal, tepid Ukraine support) but not strategic damage and coupled with some very good decisions (block China access to GPUs, energy policy)

I&#39;m an atmospheric and soil scientist returning right now from the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, where atmospheric science is one of the largest sections of the 25,000-person conference and >60,000-member Union.

There was an emergency town hall at the meeting after the NCAR announcement on Wednesday. One of the largest ballrooms in the convention center (New Orleans) was packed for the town hall. At one point, a (non-NCAR) scientist asked anyone to stand up if they have collaborated with or used NCAR data in the past few years. At least 90% of the people in the room stood up. It was quite moving in person.

NCAR is a resource that has spent decades performing world-leading research. They are notably non-political, they don&#39;t advocate policy, they perform research, acquire data, and report it. They do a very wide range of research that is important for defense, air travel, aeronautics, meteorology, hurricane and tornado prediction, climatology, and air pollution. Note that I tucked climatology in that list - it&#39;s a fraction of the research they do.

An important point: the proposed &quot;break up&quot; is enormously inefficient and expensive. These NCAR scientists are in the same place because their research all overlaps enough that there is benefit to them being together. If they split into different sections, people will have to be relocated, laboratories will have to be moved (short term costs) and new support staff will be required at every new site (long term costs).  So not only is this a bad idea in terms of science, it&#39;s costly.

If you&#39;re interested in contacting your senators and representatives to advocate for saving NCAR, here&#39;s a link to do so provided by AGU.

https://agu.quorum.us/campaign... [quorum.us]

People don&#39;t care unless it slaps them in the face. Trump is running amok all over the constitution and people applaud. SCOTUS wants a king or dictator and the Epstein files are garnering the most attention just for the gossip. The senators and representatives are letting all this happen. They don&#39;t care because it doesn&#39;t affect them... now.

That&#39;s data. They literally just took data and reported it. Welcome to science. The fact that it&#39;s got political ramifications does not mean NCAR is advocating for political action. Just because politicians have made the topic political doesn&#39;t mean scientists can&#39;t research it anymore.

Maybe it can&#39;t go through your mind but DEI is what world-class institutions do *in order to achieve scientific excellence*. Maybe you can discuss an excess here or there in the USA, but the concept is now accepted by both left and right in the world.

It really really boils your piss to imagine anything being done by someone besides a straight white guy, doesn’t it? Poor little fragile thing you are.

You must have come home from a long day and found DEI fucking your wife. The current administration is all DEI hires. Not a single one of them is qualified based solely on their merit.

The war against using the word &quot;literally&quot; to mean &quot;figuratively&quot; was lost years ago.

Even if that is not the goal of this move (and there probably are other motives for doing it), the default reaction to this should not be panic and outrage, but rather ask how these shady arrangements came about in the first place.

Th e climate doesnt care... it will continue to do whatever it is going to do regardless of our belief. All shutting these programs down really means is that when we are finally forced to act it will be more expensive and disruptive. IMHO with stuff like permafrost melts it is far too late to change the climate by widespread emissions and other changes. But stopping research for whatever reason just maxiizes the ultimate cost and consequences.

The USA are fucked because their electoral system occasionally allows for a losing candidate to be elected, as it happened with W Bush and Trump (who then proceeded earn a reputation for f up a lot of things). We can&#39;t redo history but assuming the 2016 election got the result the popular vote should have given it, you&#39;d be now in a Trump first term, or in a pause in between two terms, and Trump would probably be too mentally impaired to show up for a second term after that.

Actually I intended to reply to Rosco P. Coltrane who wrote &quot;America is fucked because Americans are hopeless&quot; and I disagreed. But now at I am here and we&#39;re discussing on potential improvements, the simplest single change that would make the largest impact would be to move away from the winner-takes-all method for the Electoral College. That would allow more parties to join on a regular basis, therefore promoting more debates, and reducing polarisation. It isn&#39;t a panacea, but a necessary step. Also from

No, but it requires all the states to cooperate. GLWT.

The best thing as far as the presidency would really be just to eliminate the electoral college and move to counting the votes directly. We can do that now. Also we should do it with paper. Fuck computer voting.

Actually it would work if the electoral votes were proportionally allocated in each state according the popular vote in that state. This would actually result in the same winner as the popular vote in every presidential election in history. The problem is not that somebody in Wyoming has 4x the voting power of somebody in California or Texas. The problem is the fact that the winner in a state gets *all* the electoral votes. This means a member of the minority party in California or Texas has -1 (NEGATIVE 1)

Actually as I said in my prior comment this plan requires the states to cooperate. I understand all of that, but it&#39;s completely irrelevant.

As long as there are shit states we will have a shit country.

There is already a multi-state compact that would provide a Electoral college vote that represents the vote of the population:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

But this will never happen, because the rural states with outsized representation will never give up their power.

I saw something that might work: make the districts elect 5 representatives, using proportional representation. This would keep the politicians local, which Americans appear to like. This does mean about 5 parties will be in congress, not more, but judging by what happens in Europe it would not be much different, any fringe party is forced to immediately merge with another and there seems to be about 5 already.

I think this also makes gerrymandering very difficult, though it might be best to just outlaw it.

The Epstein files are full of both Democrats and Republicans (and probably every other political party you have heard of). Nobody in power was ever going to push for their release, since it would be full of implications for themselves and their friends. The side *not* in power will push for the release, safe in knowing that it won&#39;t happen.

It seems like they are coming up with a fake release now. Purposely-obvious redaction will discredit it and even exonerate those who are shown, and foot-dragging will not

NCAR provides information such that policymakers can make decisions that can reduce pollution or better plan for bad weather or a changing climate.

... Is like taking a sledgehammer to the foundations of reality!

You almost got it. It is a deliberate sledgehammer to the foundation of existing order that is actively hostile to MAGA base. Trump was elected to dismantle these institutions, regardless of consequences, and he is delivering on that promise. If anything, what is happening in UK and Australia is empirical evidence of what would have happened here, in US, had Trump lost.

I don’t know what you imagine is happening in the UK, but is undoubtedly not what you think it is. Or I should say “think” it is. London remains a safe and happy city, safer than the shitty towns where Reform MPs are based. The UK continues on an energy transition that’s going pretty well.   Our people continue not to be murdered in their thousands by gun-toting maniacs. Etc. As for Australia, last I checked, a broad coalition of left and right politicians had come together in revuls

&quot;nothing useful from that has resulted in decades.&quot;

There are millions of people along the gulf coast and southeastern U.S. that rely on hurricane prediction models to know whether they&#39;re in danger as tropical storms are evolving across the Atlantic into hurricanes. Hurricane prediction models, constrained by NCAR hurricane flight data and research, are crucial to saving lives and property.

What&#39;s sad is that so many people in the southeastern US who are cheering for this dismantling are also benefiting the most from NCAR hurricane research.

Remember the idiots who died in their dozens of Covid infections *actively insisting they weren’t even as they were dying*? Cults have an incredible ability to make people act in completely irrational ways.

The US government used to be the most powerful in the world because it was the government of the world’s richest country and would spend the money doing things no-one else was able to do. Now, the USG has not merely given up on both the ambition to be the world’s richest country and to do things no-one else can, it’s doing it’s damndest to run fast the other way. And all the while, absolute imbeciles like you are cheering from the bleachers.

On Thursday, the board of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts voted to rename the center “the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Weirdly, the board of the center, mostly picked by President Donald Trump, does not seem to understand that a “memorial” center is named for someone who is deceased, and thus the new name implies that Trump is dead. By Friday, Trump’s name was physically added to the building at the behest of his handpicked board. Don’t be fooled by the absurdity of Trump’s vanity and the obsequiousness of these government officials: This is not an at all an innocuous move.

American political culture has long rejected he idea that sitting officer holders, or even living persons, should be honored with buildings or institutions named for them, or have their names and faces on currency, coins, or postage stamps. This sort of behavior is alien to a republic and a democracy. It is common, however, in dictatorships. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Francisco Franco had heir faces on stamps, currency, and coins during their respective despotic reigns. Josef Stalin appeared on numerous stamps while he was the dictator of the Soviet Union and renamed a major city Stalingrad, after himself. Kim Jong-un sometimes appears on North Korean stamps.

The first United States stamps featured Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, many decades after their deaths. Our coins reflect this tradition as well, with Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Susan B. Anthony, and Sacagawea getting their faces on coinage posthumously. The tyrannical Confederate government, on the other hand, put its leaders on stamps and currency, breaking with the long United States tradition of not honoring living people in these ways.

The traditions around the naming of buildings and institutions in our democracy have been similar. And the names are often the result of nonpolitical, bipartisan decisions. Our nation’s capital was called the District of Columbia until 1802—three years after the death of George Washington—when the city of Washington was chartered. By this time Washington was seen as the “father” of our country, but his political party, the Federalist Party, was no longer in power. The Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson supported the name change. Dulles airport in Washington was named for the deceased Republican Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Democratic administration of Kennedy. When it opened, there was talk about changing the name, but the Kennedy administration kept it. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the creation of New York Municipal Airport, which opened in 1939. Shortly before he died of cancer, and after he was no longer mayor, the city named the airport for him. Similarly, Congress renamed Washington National Airport for Ronald Reagan in 1998, long after Reagan had left politics, and four years after he had announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease—and with Democrat Bill Clinton in the White House. O’Hare International Airport in Chicago was named for Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare, the first Navy pilot to win the Medal of Honor, who died in combat in 1943.

Cultural institutions are often named for those who donated to them, were leaders of them, or used their influence to create them. The Smithsonian is named for James Smithson, a British scientist who endowed the museum with a gift in his will. Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History began in 1893 but was renamed in 1905, a year before its main benefactor, Marshall Field, passed away. New York City’s Hayden Planetarium was named for a banker, Charles Hayden, who funded its creation, and passed away two years after it opened.

Which brings us to the Kennedy Center. The idea of a national cultural center had bounced around American politics for three decades before President John F. Kennedy pushed for legislation to create it, using both public and private money. The center opened in 1971, nearly eight years after JFK was assassinated. It was formally named the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Richard Nixon, a Republican, was president when it opened. In fact, Kennedy had beaten Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, but Nixon did not try to change the name. He did attend a performance there in the Eisenhower Theater, which also opened in 1971. Bipartisanship and honoring deceased leaders were etched into the building, literally.

Now Trump has physically etched a different, more sinister tradition into its walls.

The bottom line here is simple. For nearly 250 years the United States has not “honored” sitting political leaders by naming buildings or cultural institutions for them. Presidents have never appointed a board to an institution and then pressured that board to rename the institution for the president. Presidents have not signed bills, or issued executive orders, to name things after themselves. Dictators, emperors, führers, czars, kings, and “dear leaders” do such things, because it makes them feel good, powerful, and strokes their fragile egos. Presidents of a republic do not act in this way.

It is unseemly, it is childish, and it is thoroughly un-American. But it is also a warning of a path we must not continue to travel down.

Judges around the country have begun to show a simmering fury at the conduct of federal agents, including those carrying out the increasingly brutal immigration crackdowns in predominantly blue cities nationwide. At the same time, many of the same judges have begun to balk at being extravagantly and shamelessly deceived by Justice Department lawyers defending that conduct in their courtrooms. On Thursday, another federal district court judge, Gary R. Brown, lit into the Trump administration for effectively torturing immigrants in a manner that “shocks the conscience.” His 24-page ruling also castigated both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and government lawyers for submitting “evasive and demonstrably false” claims to the court under oath. Brown, a Donald Trump appointee, also raised the serious possibility of imminent contempt proceedings against those who lied to him.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed lower court judges’ escalating efforts to hold government officials accountable for shameless fabrications, contemptuous behavior, and egregious violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This picks up themes from our main show with the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, who warned us that during Trump 1.0, the lawyering could be sloppy, but it at least conformed to norms and basic rules of truth. Now the obligation of candor is simply gone, and lying to a judge’s face is a-OK. Can you tell us what happened in Judge Brown’s court?

Mark Joseph Stern: Judge Brown explained why he ordered the release of Erron Anthony Clarke, a noncitizen whom ICE detained even though he legally entered the country and has no criminal record whatsoever. ICE accused Clarke of overstaying his visa and arrested him. Brown wrote that agents may have arrested him without securing the necessary charging documents or identifying probable cause, then fudged the paperwork to obscure the fact that they acted before they had lawful authority to do so.

But set that aside. ICE then locked Clarke up at the Central Islip federal courthouse, placing him in a tiny cell designed for one person along with eight other men. They had no access to bunks, bedding, soap, showers, toothbrushes, or clean clothes. The cell was literally freezing cold. The lights stayed on 24 hours a day. The detainees had to sleep on the floor, crowded around an open toilet that reeked of urine.

Clarke challenged his detention, arguing due process violations. When it first appeared that Judge Brown was going to release him, ICE transferred him to a different facility in Newark. Brown still ordered him released immediately. ICE blatantly defied the order, holding Clarke overnight. Brown then demanded more information about Clarke’s confinement. On Thursday, he said that what ICE provided was “preposterous,” “rank hearsay,” “evasive and demonstrably false,” and filled with “material misstatements.” He accused ICE agents of lying repeatedly—quite possibly to make it seem like Clarke spent less time in torturous conditions than he did, or to cover up its effort to evade the court’s orders by transferring him to other locations. Brown also said that ICE refused to provide key details about the holding cell at the Islip courthouse. He warned that ICE has started exploiting these holding cells to cram multiple detainees into tiny spaces for long periods, subjecting them to what is essentially torture.

Brown asked for a photo of the Islip cell, but ICE would not even provide it on the grounds that doing so would “create privacy concerns” for detainees. He was having none of this. As he wrote on Thursday: “After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district, encompassing service as a prosecutor and a judge, I have never encountered anything like this. ICE’s seeming disregard of procedural requisites, combined with the chillingly brutal conditions of confinement to which Petitioner has been, and presumably would continue to be subjected, cries out for immediate remedy.” And so he found that there were “extraordinary circumstances” here that required him to grant bail and release Clarke.

I want to unpeel the onion for one quick second. It’s not just the horrifying misconduct on the part of ICE. It’s the lying. And in that sense, it feels again like we’re back in Judge James Boasberg’s courtroom with a judge who is confronted with blatant misrepresentations. According to Brown, ICE claimed that it moved Clarke from a facility to another in eight minutes, but it’s a 35-minute drive. So unless there’s an ICE rocket ship we don’t know about, these are just blatant falsifications. It does raise this question, which is the same question Judge Boasberg is exploring in D.C.: Is there some possibility that there could be consequences?

Yes, there are. This was not just a cri de coeur against ICE. There is a real possibility of consequences. Judge Brown ordered counsel for ICE to tell him why he shouldn’t enter an order of contempt as punishment for ICE’s defiance of his orders. That means he is strongly considering contempt—maybe civil, maybe criminal—against ICE agents who lied to him repeatedly and conspired to defy his orders.

Crucially, Judge Brown isn’t just considering contempt because of conduct that occurred outside his courtroom. He’s looking at ICE’s defiance of his own orders by lying to him in declarations submitted to his court, lies evidently abetted by DOJ attorneys. That actually takes this beyond Judge Boasberg’s saga, because this seems to involve cut-and-dry, eminently demonstrable perjury. I know there are a lot of hurdles that Brown would have to overcome to bring a contempt proceeding with teeth, but I do think he has a good reason to try. This case could easily escalate into the next judicial attempt to hold people accountable who absolutely need to be in order for us to protect the rule of law.

In mid-March of 2025, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt and his colleagues started hearing that the Trump administration might attempt a flagrantly lawless publicity stunt, involving migrant men, secret flights to El Salvador, a notorious gulag, and a total disregard for due process. Despite getting word that something was about to happen, and rushing into a Saturday night hearing, and then securing a TRO from DC judge James Boasberg, Lee and his colleagues were unable to prevent more than 250 men from being renditioned from Texas to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador. The legal cases spawned by the dramatic events of March 15th 2025 haven’t gone away, indeed they are reaching crucial milestones in the courts, raising foundational questions about the abuse of statutes and what it means to defy court orders. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is joined by the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt who is litigating these cases, to discuss the very high stakes of a set of cases that may have fallen off your radar in the shuffle.

How these cases play out will dictate much of what happens for the rest of Trump’s term in office by answering democracy-defining questions such as whether the antiquated and radical wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act can be unleashed on people the government deems enemies domestically, whether court orders are actually directives the Trump DoJ is bound  to follow, whether the district courts can require Pam Bondi’s justice department to assist in the finding of fact, and whether the ancient legal concepts protecting liberty of due process and habeas corpus have the force of law in Trump’s America.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you were hoping for some relief from stratospheric memory pricing, don&#39;t hold your breath. DRAM prices aren&#39;t expected to peak until at least 2026, TechInsights analyst James Sanders tells El Reg.

DRAM is an incredibly broad category and includes everything from the DDR5 found in desktops and servers to the GDDR7 and HBM used by graphics cards and AI accelerators.

The market is also notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in pricing, spiking as inventories are drawn down and cratering as new capacity is brought online, Sanders explains.

According to TechInsights, memory pricing was already on the rise in 2024, growing 88 percent from a rather steep valley the year prior. Based on previous DRAM booms, one might expect it to grow at a slower pace in 2025, before contracting in 2026 or 2027.

However, Sanders tells us that&#39;s unlikely to happen this time around. &quot;I think we&#39;re looking at the peak in 2026,&quot; he said, adding that even then he only expects DRAM prices to settle in 2027 before rising again in 2028.

So what&#39;s to blame for the sky-high memory prices? Well, as you might have already guessed, it&#39;s AI. But it&#39;s not the full story. Timing is also a factor.

According to Sanders, the AI boom kicked off at what was very possibly the worst time for memory vendors. &quot;This demand started in the Valley for the DRAM industry. That makes financially trying to build additional capacity really challenging,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&#39;re rushing, the time to bring additional capacity online is about three years. It&#39;s a quirk of bad timing that&#39;s led to the circumstances that we&#39;re in now.&quot;

More realistically, DRAM vendors, like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are looking at four or five years to ramp production at a new fab, at which time the market conditions could have changed considerably.

Timing is also why the DRAM shortage is hitting some harder than others. &quot;The consumer market is in the stratosphere, whereas OEMs are about a year out, and they&#39;re not getting heartburn quite yet,&quot; he explained.

In other words, giant hardware vendors like Dell and HP aren&#39;t suffering nearly as much because they tend to lock in their orders early, while smaller vendors are at the mercy of spot pricing. In fact, ahead of the Christmas holiday, G.Skill, a supplier of memory for gamers, issued a statement pinning the blame for jacking the price of its products on AI.

&quot;DRAM prices are experiencing significant industry-wide volatility, due to severe global supply constraints and shortages, driven by unprecedented high demand from the AI industry,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;As a result, G.Skill procurement and sourcing costs have substantially increased. G.Skill pricing reflects industry-wide component cost increases from IC suppliers and is subject to change without notice based on market conditions.&quot;

What&#39;s more, AI is driving demand for a different class of memory that, unlike traditional DRAM, isn&#39;t much use in most consumer applications.

&quot;This is a little bit different from previous boom-bust cycles, in that wafers are being redirected toward HBM and away from consumer-grade memory,&quot; Sanders said.

High-bandwidth memory consists of multiple layers of DRAM, which as the name implies, enables it to achieve much higher bandwidth than a typical DRAM module you might find in a notebook or RDIMM. With HBM3e, it&#39;s not uncommon to see a single 36 GB chip deliver 1 TB/s of bandwidth. By comparison, a single 8 GB LPDDR5x module might be able to achieve 140 GB/s.

HBM is used almost exclusively in high-end datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia&#39;s B300, AMD&#39;s MI355X, or Amazon&#39;s Trainium3. Because of this, Sanders says, the memory market is rapidly diverging.

&quot;Because there&#39;s no consumer demand for HBM — the consumer market can&#39;t bear that price at all — it is really becoming two markets that are detached from each other,&quot; he said.

Memory vendors are currently in the midst of a memory transition as they prepare to ramp production of HBM4 modules, which will power chips like Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin and AMD&#39;s MI400s starting next year. Initially, Sanders says these chips will command a price premium.

And while TechInsights does expect the memory market to settle in 2027, it won&#39;t last. As you may recall, Nvidia plans to cram 576 Rubin-Ultra GPUs each equipped with a terabyte of HBM4e memory into a single rack starting in, that&#39;s right, 2027.

This might explain why Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra recently told investors that due to strong AI datacenter demand, &quot;aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Not that he&#39;s really complaining. While end customers are grappling with memory prices that have gone up 3x in just a few months, the memory fabs are raking in the cash. In Micron&#39;s Q1 2026 earnings call this month, the company saw revenues rise 56 percent while net income more than doubled from $1.87 billion this time last year to $5.24 billion.

And while memory vendors may now have the capital necessary to finance additional fabs, it&#39;ll be at least three more years before they enter production. And even when they do, the bulk of capacity is likely to be allocated toward HBM and other enterprise products.

One wildcard in all of this is China&#39;s CXMT, Sanders explains.

&quot;CXMT doesn&#39;t necessarily play by the same set of rules that everyone else does,&quot; he explained.

For one, they don&#39;t have any meaningful HBM output at this time. Second, many had expected the company to focus heavily on DDR4, but instead, Sanders says the company now appears to be transitioning to DDR5.

Today, CXMT isn&#39;t a very large player in the DRAM business. It certainly doesn&#39;t help that the company is subject to United States export controls. Despite this, TechInsights expects the company to grow considerably by the end of the decade from five to 10 percent of the market, which should in theory help grow the supply of DDR5 overall. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">hands on Infinite Machine, a New York-based electric vehicle startup, began with a stolen Vespa.

Eddie Cohen, president and co-founder of the company, told The Register that he and his brother Joseph were living together during the COVID outbreak.

&quot;His Vespa had gotten stolen and we just kinda had this crazy idea … if we were to design one for the future that was all-electric, had the best technology, what would it look like? What would it feel like?&quot; Cohen explained.

As I stood beside P1, a $10,000 electric seated scooter, and Olto, a $3,495 bike-lane legal class 2 e-bike, that question had been answered. The brothers&#39; company started shipping the P1 to customers in October and expects to deliver Olto in early 2026.

&quot;We just started dabbling and we came up with P1, you know, just a sketch,&quot; said Cohen, who had a background in product design. &quot;And then, over the subsequent two or three years, we just continued to noodle on it. Nights and weekends, we both had other jobs.&quot;

In January, 2024, he said, Infinite Machines became their full-time job. He and his brother assembled a team and began moving from sketch to actual product.

&quot;So P1 is a plated, M-class vehicle,&quot; said Cohen, meaning drivers should be licensed for motorcycles unless they only use it in Mode 1, where speed is capped at 30 mph.

&quot;It goes 65 miles an hour, 60-mile range. The battery is in the floor. It fits two people. It has a full touchscreen – 8.5&quot; display – that has what we call Phone Connect. So it connects to your iPhone, you get Maps. Music, etc. It has whisper-quiet acceleration. It&#39;s kind of like riding a Tesla for the first time, but it&#39;s even more surreal because it&#39;s silent.&quot;

The P1, said Cohen, was designed from scratch. &quot;All of the componentry is custom-toolled and developed. That&#39;s not a trivial thing.&quot;

He pointed to the fender for example. It&#39;s not off the shelf.

&quot;We designed it,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the tooling. We made the molds, and made it so that the engineering works just because we actually care about the details.&quot;

It&#39;s an opinionated design. The use of anodized aluminum and steel makes comparisons with the Tesla Cybertruck unavoidable. But the DMC DeLorean is an equally apt comparison, perhaps more so given the challenging nature of startup vehicle companies.

&quot;We were inspired by the Cybertruck,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;but we didn&#39;t set out to design the Cybertruck of scooters. We used it as one reference point in a lineage of vehicles, like Marcelo Gandini and the Lancias back in the day. The Diablo, the Countach, the DeLorean, like these are all references that we love.&quot;

Cohen added that the plan is to explore future colors, and variants for specific markets like police and other first responders.

Your correspondent had the opportunity to take the P1 for a spin in San Francisco and it was a thrill – it&#39;s fun, fast, and handles well. I&#39;m not by nature a rider of scooters or motorcycles, though I&#39;ve enjoyed the lazy ease of electric bikes. Were I a younger man, more willing to mix it up among motorists without the protection of an automotive frame, airbags, and a seatbelt, I&#39;d be looking seriously at the P1 or the more modest Olto for urban transportation.

The P1 includes just the right number of physical buttons, with well-conceived software and hardware. It features secure storage, front and rear cameras, phone-based keyless access, and GPS location tracking, among other niceties. It relies on a Linux fork called IMOS, Infinite Machine OS.

Presently, there&#39;s no AI on-board – which this reporter considers a selling point. Cohen recounted how someone had asked the company&#39;s head of systems what AI is being explored. &quot;He kind of was like, &#39;Look, they&#39;re expensive, right? You put a Nvidia chip on here and you put a camera and it&#39;s expensive. It adds to the [bill-of-materials] cost. And it&#39;s not obvious that there is value there.&quot;

He added however that the company has ideas for ways AI might be useful to improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.

Software applications for the vehicles will be developed in time. Cohen said that Infinite Machine does gather data to understand how people are using its vehicles, but does so in a way that respects privacy.

&quot;So we don&#39;t know anything about the individual rider and we have anonymized everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We care about rider privacy. We also care about, like, you buy this vehicle, it&#39;s just gonna work. Like you don&#39;t have to pay a subscription ever. It&#39;s just gonna work all the time and it&#39;s your vehicle. But we do anonymize and track usage.&quot;

Cohen said he expects the target market in the US will be those who appreciate technology and design. &quot;They want something that&#39;s new and they want the best,&quot; he said.

&quot;In 2025, the ultimate luxury is really time and freedom to do what you want. And P1 saves you time. It&#39;s the fastest and best way to get around any city like in San Francisco, this thing is liberating. It&#39;s amazing. It handles the hills totally well. You can park it anywhere. You don&#39;t have to spend 30 minutes looking for a spot. You get to live life on your own terms.&quot;

Cohen expects the Olto will have broader appeal.

&quot;For Olto, I think it&#39;s for everyone,&quot; he said &quot;I think it&#39;s the mom in Brooklyn dropping her kids to school. I think it&#39;s the person that is single and wants to commute to work. I think it&#39;s the SoCal kid that&#39;s going to school. This is an accessible vehicle. It&#39;s very easy to ride, very approachable, and affordable.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Venezuelan gang described by US officials as &quot;a ruthless terrorist organization&quot; faces charges over alleged deployment of malware on ATMs across the country, illegally siphoning millions of dollars.

Two indictments were returned in Nebraska, collectively charging 54 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang in connection with a spate of ATM jackpotting attacks.

The gang allegedly deployed a variant of Ploutus malware on ATMs across the US. Court documents assert that TdA members would travel in groups and compromise ATMs managed by certain banks and credit unions.

The alleged gang members would inspect each ATM for external security features before opening the machine&#39;s door, checking for alarms being triggered or law enforcement rushing to the scene.

Once they confirmed a machine could be safely tampered with, the suspects would either remove the ATM&#39;s hard drive and install the Ploutus variant before reinstalling it, or in some cases simply replace the hard drive with one that already had Ploutus installed. Other instances saw the malware deployed using external thumb drives.

Thought to be first observed in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus malware targets the cash-dispensing module of ATMs, allowing attackers to issue commands that force the machine to spurt out bills.

According to data shared by the Justice Department, ATM jackpotting attacks have seen more than $40 million stolen via physical device tampering and malware deployment since 2020. It did not share specific figures about how much of that could be attributed to TdA.

&quot;Tren de Aragua is not just a criminal gang; they are a ruthless terrorist organization that preys on communities, spreads fear, and bankrolls violence across borders,&quot; said Mark Zito, special agent in charge at HSI Kansas City.

&quot;HSI and our law enforcement partners will track you down, break up your networks, and ensure you never find safe harbor in the United States. Our mission is to protect American families from predators who think they can operate with impunity. We will not tolerate foreign terrorists stealing from our citizens and threatening our homeland. Our communities are safer today because of the relentless work of this team, and we are just getting started.&quot;

Across the various indictments against alleged TdA members in Nebraska over the past year are additional charges related to assault, money laundering, and sex trafficking of minors.

The announcement comes as the US announces a broader crackdown on the Venezuelan gang, with a slew of indictments across various states charging hundreds of alleged members since January.

The DOJ in Washington also unsealed indictments on Thursday related to other violent crimes committed by more than 70 alleged members, including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking.

Two of the group&#39;s suspected leaders were indicted in Colorado on various charges, including RICO offenses, while the alleged mastermind and co-leader of TdA, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, was charged in New York.

Flores remains at large, although there is a $5 million bounty on his head. The co-leader of TdA escaped from Venezuela&#39;s Tocorón prison in 2012, allegedly with the help of Jimena Romina Araya Navarro – another TdA leader – before being sent back in 2013.

Tocorón was notoriously lawless for years, but during the early 2000s, TdA began to assemble, and by the following decade, it assumed total control of the prison, infamously building amenities such as the Tokio nightclub, a zoo, a swimming pool, and more.

In 2023, Venezuelan authorities regained control of the facility in an operation that saw 11,000 officers storm the grounds, but Flores and his associates reportedly escaped days before.

In other states, New Mexico charged 11 alleged members over violent and armed crimes, and in Texas, more suspected high-ranking members and those in leadership roles were charged with cocaine trafficking, murder, and extortion.

The renewed focus on tackling TdA began in February when Attorney General Pamela Bondi expanded the remit of Joint Task Force Vulcan. Created in 2019, it was originally tasked with bringing down MS-13 gang members, but is now also responsible for handling TdA.

&quot;Immediately upon taking office, I directed the Department of Justice to fiercely pursue the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations,&quot; said Bondi.

&quot;This latest multi-state series of charges underscores the Trump Administration&#39;s unwavering commitment to restoring public safety, dismantling violent trafficking networks, and ridding our country of Tren de Aragua terrorists.&quot; ®

Holiday shoppers, it’s time to finish knocking out that seasonal wish list. At this point, your online purchases may not arrive in time unless you’re willing to pay extra for priority shipping — or you happen to get lucky. Still, gifting anything at all is awfully nice of you, regardless of when it arrives. If you’re shopping on a budget of $50 or less per item, we’ve crafted this gift guide specifically for you.

Below, we’ve assembled a delightful set of practical gifts that can improve just about anybody’s life. Quince silk pillowcase can make for a blissful night’s sleep, for instance, and your giftee will surely think of you while using Unihand’s handy set of rechargeable hand warmers. Alternatively, you can level up their bread-making game with King Arthur’s elegant sourdough crock, or ensure their quality coffee intake never falters when they’re away from home thanks to the Aeropress Go. Needless to say, there are many ways to deliver happiness.

Remind yourself of the summer months ahead, flush with ripe, succulent heirloom tomatoes, with this replica beeswax candle that can burn for up to 20 hours. Though it’s so scrumptious-looking, you may not wish to melt it away.

I invite you to start (or enhance) your homemade sourdough bread-making journey with this glass crock from King Arthur, which makes it easy to tell how much your starter has grown (or shrunk) since its last feeding.

There are some who think little of the pillowcase they sleep on. However, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with treating yourself to something better. A silk pillowcase can feel more deluxe than you might imagine, and these are under $50 each.

If the one thing stopping you or a loved one from using cookbooks more often is because of how much counter space they take up, snag this cookbook stand that’ll give you back some of that working surface to prep ingredients on.

A key light is one of the best additions you can make to your home office. It can make you feel more awake (and look better in video calls). But many are needlessly pricey, so grab this 10.2-inch model that’s under $50.

Whether you’re indoors or outdoors, you’ve got to keep your hands warm. Warmth keeps your digits limber, and these rechargeable hand warmers are a great asset, lasting up to 20 hours per charge and going up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are more powerful blenders than the OG Magic Bullet, but few match its versatility, convenience, and compact footprint. The original 250W model remains well suited for making a variety of single-serve creations, from creamy milkshakes and pico to post-workout smoothies.

This game puts a fresh, multi-round spin on charades. Your teammates need to guess what’s on your card, and how much verbal info you can give away to them dwindles as the game progresses, thus increasing the challenge.

While most people are content to store their files in the cloud, some content is too precious not to save on personal digital devices. Sandisk’s multi-plug flash drive makes it easy to move data between phones, tablets, and computers.

Lovingly reminiscent of the Sega Saturn controller, GuliKit’s wireless Elves 2 can connect to PC, Switch, or Switch 2, serving as a compact but competent gamepad that’s great for small-handed gamers.

What’s the point of a clippable zip-up bag this small? Basically, you can use it to stash anything you would otherwise put in your pocket but fear slipping out. That includes chapstick, cash, cards, earbuds, you name it. Just be sure to leave the actual street tacos at your local tienda.

A fold-up pocket blanket is an underrated addition to anyone’s everyday repertoire of this-and-that. You never know when you’ll want to pop a squat on a fresh patch of grass, or use it to feel more comfortable during a long ride.

One of Amazon’s smallest, least expensive smart speakers is among its best currently available. The Echo Pop sounds fantastic and adds a pop of color to any room you put it in. It comes in white, black, purple, or teal.

Two things most people need at some point are a flashlight and a Bluetooth tracker. So why not gift both devices at once? The FlashFinder is a rechargeable, 300-lumen light outfitted with a magnetic mount you can track via Apple’s Find My network, so you never have to worry about trying to find the flashlight — or your keys — again.

No matter who you are, your desk is going to get a little messy. Stray hairs, dust, little wrapper pieces, and more can wind up strewn about, but thankfully, this small, AA-powered vacuum can suck it all up with relative ease.

One of my least favorite parts of traveling is the struggle to find good coffee. A simple solution is to bring the AeroPress Go with your favorite coffee grounds. With it, you can make a great cup of coffee no matter where you are.

Big Bluetooth speakers deliver big sound, unsurprisingly. But JBL’s compact Go 4 punches above its weight. It can deliver impressive sound quality at home, in the bathroom, on a bike ride, or poolside.

Whether you have an unwieldy slab of a phone or something smaller, you probably want to prevent drops, right? The Snap 5 grip attaches via MagSafe magnets, so you can hold it at multiple angles in a secure, comfortable manner.

Desktop speakers can set you back a pretty penny, but they don’t have to. Creative’s Pebble V3 sound great wired into a PC via USB-C, and you can connect more devices to them wirelessly via Bluetooth.

Sure, there’s something very satisfying about lighting a candle. But it’s better for your health to use a candle warmer instead. Plus, you’ll get to smell your favorite scents without dealing with the danger of an open flame.

Pocket-friendly power banks that come with built-in USB-C cables are beloved, and it’s easy to see why. Anker’s 10,000mAh Zolo with 30W charging speeds is just big enough, and fast enough, to quickly recharge most small gadgets.

Nothing’s CMF Buds 2A go well beyond what you might expect from a $49 set of wireless earbuds. They offer active noise cancellation, great mic and sound quality, IP54 protection against water and dust, and other sought-after features.

You don’t need to pay dearly for a mouse that can help you soothe a pain-stricken wrist. Seenda’s rechargeable ergonomic mouse lets your wrist pronate while you’re computing, which could bring some much-needed relief.

If you’ve ever been curious about how quickly your devices charge while plugged into a battery pack or wall adapter, Toocki makes a 6.6-foot cable with a built-in display that’ll tell you just how many watts are passing through (up to 100W). Now, let’s hope you’re a fan of pastel blue.

No one likes carrying more cables than they really need to. If you’re traveling with any combination of phone, tablet, e-reader, laptop, or gaming handheld, snag Anker’s 2-in-1 USB-C cable, which can help you charge two of them at once.

There’s nothing quite as nostalgic as building a Lego set. The 484-piece Medium Creative Brick Box contains the pieces you’ll need to make your own custom scenes, plus specific bricks to create Lego vehicles, animals, and other objects — including a windmill and toaster. The pieces come in a giant Lego brick-shaped bucket for easy storage.

AirTags can function as a second set of eyes for iPhone owners, allowing you to keep tabs on everything from your car keys to your backpack. That’s because the ultra wideband location trackers tap into Apple’s extensive Find My network, which allows for impressively precise tracking and lets users share the tracker with up to five other people for even greater peace of mind.

Do you ever wish you could turn on your coffee maker or hit the light switch without getting up? The SwitchBot Bot lets you do that. All you need to do is stick the inexpensive contraption on a standard button or rocker switch, which will allow you to control or schedule your pet feeder, garage door, and a wide range of other devices from your smartphone.

If you’re looking for a tech-free way to entertain friends or family while huddling for warmth indoors, board games like Evolution are perfect. The card-based strategy game rewinds time, pitting players against one another and forcing them to adapt to an ever-changing ecosystem in which hungry predators loom and resources are always at a premium.

Glocusent’s Bookmark Style Reading Light is the perfect gift for those who burn the midnight oil reading. The clip-on USB light offers a lightweight design and multiple brightness levels, providing a soft, warm glow that’s dim enough that it won’t disturb anyone else trying to get some shut-eye nearby.

When managed correctly, bamboo draws sustenance from its roots for nearly infinite growth — but growing it indoors requires patience and ongoing care. Lego’s Lucky Bamboo set can be great for someone who loves the look of bamboo but not necessarily the maintenance. Building the 325-piece set still takes a while, but when you’re done, you’re done for good.

This slick phone mount, compatible with MagSafe-enabled iPhones and other devices with magnetized cases, gives you a handy place to slap your phone. It sticks to your wall via 3M adhesive, and its waterproof, nylon design won’t scratch your gadgets.

Anker’s 67W Prime charger features two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, along with retractable prongs, rendering it one of our go-to travel companions. It’s a gadget that lets you easily charge a MacBook Air and a Nintendo Switch 2 with a port to spare.

Who needs magnets when you have suction cups? Octobuddy’s cheap silicone mount works with most phones to provide hands-free flexibility whenever necessary. It features 24 single-sided cups, which allow you to stick your phone to a mirror, window, or any other surface you think will provide that perfect TikTok angle.

Your desk could probably use a fun distraction to help you unwind a little in the middle of the day. The Mini Buddha Board lets you create ephemeral sketches using water and the included brush. Once the water evaporates you’ll be left with a blank board to create a new work, no cleanup necessary.

The most affordable Steam Deck, the $399 LCD model, is not available in the US. And, according to the Steam Deck site, it won’t be coming back. Underneath the listings for the various models is a note that says:

We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.

And, well, it’s no longer in stock on the US site.

Valve’s decision to phase out the Steam Deck LCD is disappointing. That means the most affordable Steam Deck is now the 512GB OLED model, which costs $549, quite a bit more than the former entry-level version.

We’ve reached out to Valve for comment, but have yet to hear back. Without an official explanation from the company, we’re left to speculate about why the Steam Deck LCD was discontinued. Andy Hales at Windows Central suggests that rising RAM and storage prices (thanks, AI) have made it difficult to continue offering a handheld at that price point.

The PC gaming handheld market is much more robust than it was when the Steam Deck first debuted in 2022, but it’s hard to see any of the other players, like Lenovo, ASUS, or GPD, filling that entry-level void.

            <div id="article-text">﻿And really, is there more you could want from a game?

﻿And really, is there more you could want from a game?

One day, video game critics and journalists will put together a comprehensive study on the impact Balatro had on the industry — of how so many games that came after tried to capture its essence by adding complex systems to otherwise simple, easily understood games. Until then, I’m gonna play Dogpile.

Dogpile is a deckbuilding match-3 roguelike that builds on the style of merge games like Suika Game by adding a Balatro-like twist. The result is a cute, cozy (in both genre and vibe) game that appeals to both the numbers-go-up and the dog-loving sicko in me. Drop matching dogs on top of each other to create bigger dogs that reward you with points to unlock higher levels. The smallest unit of dog is a Chihuahua, two Chihuahuas merge to form a Pomeranian (at least that’s what I think it is), and so forth. The dogs pile up the playing field kinda like Tetris, and also like Tetris, if the dogs spill over the top of the field, it’s game over.

Merging dogs is the simplest part of the game. It’s where the player has the least control — everything is subject to the whims of gravity, physics, and trajectory — but also where Dogpile is the most thrilling. The dogs themselves are cute, contorted into fun, confounding shapes that sometimes show off a butthole or two. Introducing modifiers like making the dogs bouncy or magnetic adds an interesting physical component to the game — Dogpile is match-3 Tetris, yes, but built with a physics engine. It feels so silly, so “baby distracted by jangling keys” to say that a pug glomming onto another pug to make a dachshund is gameplay action worth highlighting in the year of our gaming lord 2025. But the little guy does so with a satisfying “pop” accompanied by a cute little “arf” that like Benoit Blanc, I’m compelled.

Though the game has nothing to do with poker, you can see the DNA of Balatro running throughout. Like Balatro, each round you’re dealt a hand from a deck of cards that have dogs as the different suits. Also like Balatro, you get money to spend on modifying your deck with more cards and tags that work similar to Balatro’s jokers. For $15 (of in-game money, there are no microtransactions), you can either buy a chow chow card or a tag that makes certain dogs spin in place to agitate the dog pile for more merging opportunities. When you win a round, you also visit the grooming salon where you modify your dog cards directly. You can give a dog positive traits like “friendly,” making them magnetically attracted to their matches. Or you can wash away negative traits like fleas, which negate any positive traits a card might have.

Building your dog deck full of synergies to increase your points is where Dogpile is the most like Balatro and where the bulk of your strategic thinking comes into play. I like to give my dogs the barking trait that makes them disturb the pile with a bark when they’re dropped. That combined with the tag that awards points every time a dog barks makes for a brain-pleasing display of meters filling up and cash register noises going off that really drives home the fact that a lot of these well-intentioned, celebrated Balatro-likes tap into the psychology of gambling addition to make them stick.

Dogpile doesn’t feel very deep. There are no boss challenges. Failing to meet the point threshold doesn’t end a run, but instead makes you pick from a stock of negative events or traits that are either easily ignored or so detrimental that you lose the game immediately. Unlike Balatro, Dogpile doesn’t inspire the same feeling of endless possibility of the kinds of decks you can build.

Dogpile isn’t the first game to complexify the humble match-3 genre, and I don’t know if its similarities to Balatro are intentional or not. But I like seeing how games can push Balatro’s formula beyond poker — especially if a dog is involved.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road. Read the full story.—Caiwei Chen

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
