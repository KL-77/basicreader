            <h2>America, it's time to think beyond leather for luxury car seats</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/02/america-its-time-to-think-beyond-leather-for-luxury-car-seats/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A long time ago, in (I believe) an issue of Car Magazine from the mid-1990s, the designer Gordon Murray shared his thoughts about a possible four-door follow-up to the McLaren F1.

Road cars weren’t really his thing. Until then, his career had been focused on Formula 1 car design, and he brought that sport’s obsession with weight savings with him. Were he to design a sedan, he’d trim the interior with textile, not leather. After all, wool made fine suits and coats, Murray reasoned, and it would save weight.

A four-door McLaren never happened during his tenure, nor has one appeared since. Murray now runs his own boutique hypercar company, which also builds no sedans. But the idea that high-end cars could use something other than leather has stuck with me, especially after driving BMW’s i7, which  debuted in 2022 with a premium cashmere wool interior. More recently, new EVs have experimented with interesting textile alternatives to leather. Two good examples are the BMW iX3 and the Audi A6, though neither can be ordered with these textile options in the US.

It’s hardly the first time US-market cars have had different options. Our Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards insist on features like side reflectors, which Europe doesn’t need, and we maintain somewhat old headlight rules. You’re also unlikely to see any of the smaller-engined versions of luxury cars from German brands being offered for North American consumption. But it did make me wonder why we’re being left in the cold.

We’re used to American Audis being a bit different. We couldn’t have the R8’s laser high beam headlights or the A6’s OLED animated taillights, and we’re not getting the station wagon version of that car, the A6 Avant, at all. Or the A5 Avant. I reached out to the automaker to ask why it didn’t think its American customers would go for the textile trim.

An Audi USA spokesperson told Ars that “while we applaud the sustainable factor of cloth seats, customers continue to prefer leather/leather-like seats in luxury vehicles and note that it is easier to clean… [and] easier to get into and out of (i.e., ingress/egress as clothes sometimes cling to fabric seats).”

Similarly, BMW doesn’t always bring its good stuff across this side of the Atlantic. There was no Z1, and the E36 M3 had a much lesser engine thanks to federal and Californian emissions regulations, just to pick two (admittedly old) examples. BMW told me that, like its counterpart Audi, its customers are mostly fine with synthetic leather-like alternatives to animal hides.

“We continuously evaluate market trends, industry developments, and customer feedback when considering new features and materials,” a BMW spokesperson said. “Currently, our customers are very satisfied with our animal-free materials such as SensaTec and Veganza as well as our traditional leather options. While there has been some interest in textile materials, the demand has focused on more premium options like Alcantara and microfiber rather than traditional cloth. Accordingly, we have been expanding our range of these premium textile materials in recent years.”

Think motorsports-inspired interiors and perhaps more plushness like in that i7, but it seems we shouldn’t expect eco seats woven from recycled plastics, unlike in Europe.

Every year, AutoPacific surveys more than 18,000 people planning to buy or lease a new car to gauge their interest in dozens of potential new features to pin down what American car buyers really want in their next vehicle. The market research company asked survey respondents about upholstery, though leather and animal-free alternatives were the options.

“Expectedly, among shoppers who would consider buying a luxury vehicle, demand is the strongest for leather, followed by upgraded leather that may have quilting, accent stitching, or other seat design enhancements,” said Robby DeGraff, manager of product and consumer insights at AutoPacific. “When we shift away from real leather over to the alternatives and imitations, demand begins to fall, but not by much. For example, of those who said they would consider buying an Aston Martin, 32 percent want genuine leather or upgraded leather, while 31 percent of them would be a-OK with leatherette or a sustainable leatherette material.”

“Dipping a bit more down the price ladder but still within the luxury space, there’s greater differences in demand for real leather versus imitation leather (sustainable or not), among future Cadillac buyers, Lexus, buyers, as well as future Porsche and Mercedes-Benz buyers,” DeGraff said.

Indeed, Cadillac has always had a particularly American approach to the luxury car, and in its new Optiq electric crossover, that approach includes some cool textiles made entirely from recycled materials. It’s about meeting customers’ expectations, according to Jennifer Widrick, director of global colors, materials, and finishes at General Motors Design.

“Cadillac specifically uses fabric as a distinct element to reinforce quality detailing, a connection to fashion, and interior design trends,” Widrick said. “Fabric provides added depth through multiple color yarns in precise constructions on surfaces that would otherwise be one color. Customers recognize these details as synonymous with quality and modernity.”

You shouldn’t think of it as one material versus another, Widrick said. “Rather, the layering and customer appreciation of detailing is more discerning. In addition to the depth that fabric textures can bring to the surface of automotive interiors, they provide opportunity for a more conscious material approach,” she said. “Fabric has evolved for Cadillac in that it is no longer just a seating material but an element that is reaching out into other areas of the vehicle. It’s an exciting shift to see known materials placed in reimagined ways that create fresh interaction experiences for customers.”

Harmony is key. “Shape, scale, haptic, and proportion are taken into consideration to tailor the fabric for a premium impression. Fabric can work in harmony or be used as a design element to move your eye throughout the interior,” Widrick said.

At least one OEM understands the brief. “Take Volvo’s wool, which not only looks incredible—it feels truly incredible to sit in a seat engulfed in it. That’s a sustainable, inviting, and remarkably premium alternative to common leather that I wish more automakers would explore,” AutoPacific’s DeGraff said.

“At Volvo Cars, we believe that good design, quality, and sustainability are inherently connected. Recycled and renewable materials aren’t just an option for us, they’re essential to shape a better future,” said Rekha Meena, head of colors, materials, and finishes at Volvo Cars. “Our responsibility is to blend these elements seamlessly, creating a sense of luxury and timelessness, all while ensuring that our products stand the test of time.”

Like Widrick at Cadillac, Meena wants Volvo interiors to have a sense of harmony, and that’s on good display with the EX90. “When it comes to textiles, we see the versatility and strong potential to deliver all these qualities combining warmth, tactility, and refined expression in a way that enhances both the driving experience and the emotional connection to the interior,” Meena said.

Textiles have a long tradition in Scandinavian design, where “luxury is about simplicity, honesty, and attention to detail,” Meena told Ars. “When developed with care, textile upholstery can feel refined, modern, and long-lasting. Textiles allow us to create softness and depth in ways other materials cannot, resulting in interiors that feel calm, thoughtful, and welcoming.”

As for when to break away from leather, that’s up to the experience the design team wants to create for drivers. “We do not view textiles as replacements for leather or vinyl,” Meena said. “Each material has its own strengths, and customer choice remains paramount. What textiles offer, however, is something distinct: greater variation, a richer sensory experience, and a more human, approachable character.”

That sense of harmony is achieved with the tailored wool blend option for Volvo’s EX90, and all four of the trim options for the affordable EX30 feature some degree of textile trim on the seats and door panels. Indeed, Volvo’s distinctive and somewhat left-field style is now as much part of the brand as its stated commitment to road safety.

That’s all to say that I think it’s time for more luxury brands to get bold with their materials. A sofa or lounge chair doesn’t need animal hide to be considered stylish or luxurious, and neither does a car interior. It just needs good design.</div>

            <h2>FDA refuses to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna’s application for an mRNA flu vaccine, the company revealed Tuesday.

While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations and canceled $500 million in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats.

In a news release late Tuesday, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA’s refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company’s Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA’s rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used.

In the trial, which enrolled nearly 41,000 participants and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Moderna compared the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1010 to licensed standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline. The trial found that mRNA-1010 was superior to the comparators.

Moderna said the FDA reviewed and accepted its trial design on at least two occasions (in April 2024 and again in August 2025) before it applied for approval of mRNA-1010. It also noted that Fluarix has been used as a comparator vaccine in previous flu vaccine trials, which tested vaccines that went on to earn approval.

But in a letter dated February 3, Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator under the Trump administration, informed Moderna that the agency does not consider the trial “adequate and well-controlled” because the comparator vaccine “does not reflect the best-available standard of care.”

In its news release, Moderna noted that neither the FDA’s regulation nor its guidance to industry makes any reference to a requirement of the “best-available standard of care” in comparators.

“This decision by [the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research], which did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product, does not further our shared goal of enhancing America’s leadership in developing innovative medicines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the release. “It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.”

Moderna said it has requested a meeting with the FDA to understand the basis of the refusal. “We look forward to engaging with CBER to understand the path forward as quickly as possible so that America’s seniors, and those with underlying conditions, continue to have access to American-made innovations.”

The company noted that mRNA-1010 has already been accepted for review in the European Union, Canada, and Australia.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/spacexs-starbase-is-coming-alive-again-after-a-lull-in-starship-testing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster.

SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: “Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster’s redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength.”

Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey’s Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster’s propellant tanks on launch day.

The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3, or Block 3. SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3.

The Super Heavy booster originally assigned to the first Starship V3 test flight failed during a pressure test in November. The rocket’s liquid oxygen tank ruptured under pressure, and SpaceX scrapped the booster and moved on to the next in line—Booster 19. This Super Heavy vehicle appears have sailed through stress testing, and SpaceX returned the booster to the factory early Monday. There, technicians will mount 33 Raptor engines to the bottom of the rocket and install the booster’s grid fins.

These components are changed from Starship V2. The Raptor engines set to debut on Starship V3 produce more thrust and include changes to improve reliability, according to SpaceX. The Raptor 3s are lighter, with plumbing and sensors integrated into the engine’s main structure, eliminating the requirement for self-contained heat shields between the engines at the base of the rocket.

The new booster design only uses three grid fins, not four, to provide controllability during descent. The aerosurfaces help stabilize the rocket as it returns to Earth for recovery. The hot-staging ring at the top of the new version of the Super Heavy booster is integrated with the rocket to enable its return to Earth for reuse. The ring was jettisoned and expended on previous Starship flights.

After receiving its engines and grid fins, the Super Heavy booster will roll out to the launch pad at Starbase. SpaceX’s launch team will fill it with methane and liquid oxygen for a test-firing of its 33 engines.

Meanwhile, the first of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship vehicles—essentially the upper stage that flies on top of the Super Heavy booster—will travel to the Massey’s Test Site for its own cryogenic proof test campaign. It is also expected to undergo a static fire test of its six Raptor engines.

Assuming that all goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March. This will be the 12th full-scale Starship/Super Heavy test flight overall, and the mission will likely follow the same trajectory as previous flights, with Starship arcing halfway around the world from South Texas to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

With the upcoming launch, SpaceX is eager to prove Starship V3’s readiness for more ambitious test flights, including an important orbital refueling experiment considered a stepping stone toward sending future Starships to the Moon, Mars, and other distant destinations.

NASA officials are closely watching Starship V3’s development because the refueling demonstration is on the critical path for the agency’s Artemis lunar program. A human-rated version of Starship is NASA’s primary option for a Moon lander to ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission, the next Artemis flight after the Artemis II circumlunar mission that is awaiting liftoff in the coming weeks.</div>

In a request for comment page, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo.

Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.

“Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community decided to blacklist it in 2013. In 2016, the decision was overturned, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.”

Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely not more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintain readers’ trust, however, in order to be trustworthy our references also have to be safe to access.”

On the other side, an editor who supported Option C wrote that “Archive.today contains a vast amount of archives available nowhere else. Not on Wayback Machine, nowhere. It is the second largest archive provider across all Wikimedia sites. Removal/blockage of this site will be disruptive daily for thousands of editors and readers. It will result in a huge proliferation of {{dead link}} tags that will never be resolved.”

Several posts mentioned an ongoing FBI case that could eventually make the Archive.today links useless anyway. Some said it would be better to act now than to have Option A forced on them later without a backup plan.

One editor supported starting with Option B and eventually shifting to Option A with “the proper end goal being the WMF [Wikimedia Foundation] supporting some sort of archive system, whether their own original or directly supporting the Internet Archive’s work so it can be done more systematically.”

Some discussion centered on copyright infringement, given that Archive.today publishes copies of many copyrighted articles. “On the general problem of linking to copyright infringement: perhaps the Wikimedia Foundation can work on ways to establish legally licensed archives of major paywalled sites, in partnership with archives such as the Internet Archive,” one editor wrote. “It would be challenging given the business model of those sites, but maybe a workable compromise can be established that manages how many Wikipedia editors [have] access at a given time.”

The DDoS attack being discussed by Wikipedia editors was targeted at the Gyrovague blog written by Jani Patokallio. Last month, “the maintainers of Archive.today injected malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with,” the Wikipedia request for comment says. “Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their Internet connection is used to attack a certain individual’s blog.”

The trustworthiness of Archive.today was discussed in light of evidence that the site’s founder threatened to create “a new category of AI porn” in retaliation against the blogger. The AI porn threat was mentioned by several editors.

“I echo others [that Option] A is looking like something we’ll have to do eventually, anyways, and at least this way we have a chance to do it on our terms,” one editor wrote. “I hate to break it to you, but even if the FBI thing goes nowhere, a website whose operator apparently threatens to create AI porn in retaliation against enemies, using their names, isn’t a trustworthy mirror, and isn’t going to remain one.”

One editor reported being “miserable” about supporting Option A, “but we cannot permit websites to rope our readers into being part of DDoS attacks.” Moreover, “The fact is that most of the archive.today links on Wikipedia are not an attempt to save URLs that have now gone dead that the Internet Archive cannot handle, but efforts to bypass paywalls, which is convenient, but illegal. It’s strange that we accept links to archive.today for this purpose but don’t accept the same for Anna’s Archive or Sci-Hub,” the editor wrote.

Patokallio told us in an email today, “it’s true that there simply are no alternatives to archive.today for many sources that archive.org does not/cannot cover,” and that he hopes the Wikipedia request for comment “leads to the Wikimedia Foundation creating one as suggested by multiple commenters in the thread.”

The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia, chimed in on the discussion today. “Our view is that the value to verifiability that the site provides must be weighed against the security risks and violation of the trust of the people who click these links,” wrote Eric Mill, head of the foundation’s product safety and integrity group. “We (WMF) encourage the English Wikipedia community to carefully weigh the situation before making a decision on this unusual case.”

Noting that “Archive.today’s owner has not been deterred from continuing the ongoing DDoS,” Mill wrote that “the same actions that make archive.today unsafe may also reduce its usefulness for verifying content on Wikipedia. If the owners are willing to abuse their position to further their goals through malicious code, then it also raises questions about the integrity of the archive it hosts.”

It’s possible the Wikimedia Foundation will act even if the volunteer editors decide to maintain the status quo. “We know that WMF intervention is a big deal, but we also have not ruled it out, given the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis,” Mill wrote.

The Wikipedia request for comments acknowledged that whether to blacklist would be a difficult decision. There are “significant concerns for readers’ safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service,” but “a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites,” it said.

An update to the request for comments yesterday indicated that the attack temporarily stopped, but the malicious code had been reactivated. “Please do not visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack!” it said.

The code’s first public mention was apparently in a Hacker News thread on January 14, and Patokallio wrote about the DDoS in a February 1 blog post. “Every 300 milliseconds, as long as the CAPTCHA page is open, this makes a request to the search function of my blog using a random string, ensuring the response cannot be cached and thus consumes resources,” he wrote. The Javascript code in the Archive.today CAPTCHA page is as follows:

In August 2023, Patokallio wrote a post attempting to uncover the identity of Archive.today founder “Denis Petrov,” which seems to be an alias. Patokallio wasn’t able to figure out who the founder is but cobbled together various tidbits from Internet searches, including a Stack Exchange post that mentioned another potential alias, “Masha Rabinovich.”

Patokallio seemed to be driven by curiosity and was impressed by Archive.today’s work. “It’s a testament to their persistence that [they’ve] managed to keep this up for over 10 years, and I for one will be buying Denis/Masha/whoever a well deserved cup of coffee,” Patokallio’s 2023 post said. In his post this month, Patokallio said his 2023 blog “gathered some 10,000 views and a bit [of] discussion on Hacker News, but didn’t exactly set the blogosphere on fire. And indeed, absolutely nothing happened for the next two years and a bit.”

But in October 2025, the FBI sent a subpoena to domain registrar Tucows seeking “subscriber information on [the] customer behind archive.today” in connection with “a federal criminal investigation being conducted by the FBI.” We wrote about the subpoena, and our story included a link to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post in a sentence that said, “There are several indications that the [Archive.today] founder is from Russia.”

In an email to Ars, Patokallio told us that the DDoS attack “appears to be because you kindly mentioned my blog in your Nov 8, 2025 story.” Patokallio added that he is “as mystified by this as you probably are.” Articles about the subpoena by The Verge and Heise Online also linked to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post.

We emailed Archive.today’s webmaster address today to ask for comment on the Wikipedia discussion. We received an email reply that said, “Ok, but first remove the paragraph with gyrovague excerpt from your previous article.”

On January 8, 2026, Patokallio’s hosting company, Automattic, notified him that it received a GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] complaint from a “Nora Puchreiner” alleging that the 2023 post “contains extensive personal data… presented in a narrative that is defamatory in tone and context.” Patokallio said that after he submitted a rebuttal, “Automattic sided with me and left the post up.”

Patokallio said he also “received a politely worded email from archive.today’s webmaster asking me to take down the post for a few months” on January 10. The email was classified as spam by Gmail, and he didn’t see it until five days later, he said. In the meantime, the DDoS started.

Patokallio said he replied to the webmaster’s email on January 15 and again on January 20 but didn’t hear back. He tried a third time on January 25, saying he would not take down the blog post but offered to “change some wording that you feel is being misrepresented.”

Patokallio posted what he called a lightly redacted copy of the resulting email thread. The first email from the Archive.today webmaster said, “I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience.”

In a later email, “Nora Puchreiner” wrote, “I do not care on your blog and its content. I just need the links from Heise and other media to be 404.” One message threatened to investigate “your Nazi grandfather” and “vibecode a gyrovague.gay dating app.” Another threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn.

A Tumblr blog post apparently written by the Archive.today founder seems to generally confirm the emails’ veracity, but says the original version threatened to create “a patokallio.gay dating app,” not “a gyrovague.gay dating app.” The Tumblr blog has several other recent posts criticizing Patokallio and accusing him of hiding his real name. However, the Gyrovague blog shows Patokallio’s name in a sidebar and discloses that he works for Google in Sydney, Australia, while stating that the blog posts contain only his personal views.

In one email, Patokallio included a link to Wikipedia’s page on the Streisand effect, a name for situations in which people seeking to suppress access to information instead draw more public attention to the information they want hidden. The Archive.today site maintainer apparently viewed this as a threat.

“And threatening me with Streisand… having such a noble and rare name, which in retaliation could be used for the name of a scam project or become a byword for a new category of AI porn… are you serious?” the email said. Patokallio responded, “No, you’re Streisanding yourself: the DDOS has already drawn more attention to my blog post than it had gotten in the last two years, with zero action on my side.”

A subsequent reply in the email thread contained the “Nazi grandfather” and “gay dating app” threats. Patokallio wrote that after these emails, it didn’t seem worthwhile to continue the discussion. “At this point it was pretty clear the conversation had run its course, so here we are,” Patokallio wrote in his February 1 blog post. “And for the record, my long-dead grandfather served in an anti-aircraft unit of the Finnish Army during WW2, defending against the attacks of the Soviet Union. Perhaps this is enough to qualify as a ‘Nazi’ in Russia these days.”

While the outcome at Wikipedia is not yet settled, Patokallio wrote that the DDoS attack didn’t cause him any real harm. The Archive.today maintainer apparently intended to make Patokallio’s hosting costs more expensive, but “I have a flat fee plan, meaning this has cost me exactly zero dollars,” he wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">xAI co-founder Tony Wu abruptly announced his resignation from the company late Monday night, the latest in a string of senior executives to leave the Grok-maker in recent months.

In a post on social media, Wu expressed warm feelings for his time at xAI, but said it was “time for my next chapter.” The current era is one where “a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible,” he wrote.

The mention of what “a small team” can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu’s departure. xAI reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network. That number also included 900 employees that served solely as “AI tutors,” though roughly 500 of those were reportedly laid off in September.

Wu’s departure comes just months after fellow xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin departed the company in August to start his own AI safety-focused venture capital firm. Co-founders Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy also departed the company since its 2023 founding, and co-founder Greg Yang stepped back from the company last month amid complications from chronic Lyme disease.

Other recent high-profile xAI departures include general counsel Robert Keele, communications executives Dave Heinzinger and John Stoll, head of product engineering Haofei Wang, and CFO Mike Liberatore, who left for a role at OpenAI after just 102 days of what he called “120+ hour weeks.”

Wu leaves a company that is in a very different place than it was when he helped create it in 2023. His departure comes just days after CEO Elon Musk merged xAI with SpaceX, a move Musk says will allow for orbiting data centers and, eventually, “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” But some see the move as more of a financial engineering play, combining xAI’s nearly $1 billion a year in losses and SpaceX’s roughly $8 billion in annual profits into a single, more IPO-ready entity.

Musk previously rolled social media network X (formerly Twitter) into a unified entity with xAI back in March. At the time of the deal, X was valued at $33 billion, 25 percent less than Musk paid for the social network in 2022.

xAI has faced a fresh wave of criticism in recent months over Grok’s willingness to generate sexualized images of minors. That has led to an investigation by California’s attorney general and a police raid of the company’s Paris offices.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all.

Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration.

During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin.

“There are enough reports of it, enough interest in it, that we actually did—ivermectin, in particular—did engage in sort of a better preclinical study of its properties and its ability to kill cancer cells and we’ll probably have those results in a few months. So we are taking it seriously.”

The comments were highlighted today in a report from KFF Health News. Ars Technica was also at the event, “Reclaiming Science: The People’s NIH,” which was hosted by the MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] Institute. In the rest of his comments, Letai seemed to make a noticeable effort to temper expectations while also trying to avoid offending any ivermectin believers. “It’s not going to be a cure-all for cancer,” he said. At another point, he said that even if there are signals of anti-cancer properties in the preclinical studies, “I can tell you again, it’s not a really strong signal.”

But, he quickly noted, “this doesn’t rule out… individual reports of people having taken it that had a response to their cancer. This doesn’t invalidate their personal experience.”

KFF noted that among those individual reports is one from Mel Gibson, who said in a January 2025 episode of Joe Rogan’s podcast that a regimen of drugs that includes ivermectin cured stage 4 cancers in three of his friends. The episode has been viewed more than 12 million times.

NCI scientists who spoke to KFF under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation blasted the funding. “I am shocked and appalled,” one said. “We are moving funds away from so much promising research in order to do a preclinical study based on nonscientific ideas. It’s absurd.”

Another called the suggestion that the NCI had previously overlooked ivermectin’s potential “ridiculous.”

“This is not a new idea they came up with,” the NCI scientist said.

While the revelation that the NCI is funding research based on fringe anecdotes rather than scientific evidence is spurring backlash, it also raises new questions about Letai, who was otherwise a respected cancer researcher prior to taking the role of NCI director.

In an interview with STAT News last month, Letai was asked if there were ethical lines he wouldn’t cross for the administration. He responded: “My job is to progress the mission of the National Cancer Institute to reduce suffering from cancer with the resources that I’m given. If it got to a point where I couldn’t do my job, I would feel required to quit.”</div>

            <h2>ChatGPT Users Are Crashing Out Because OpenAI Is Retiring the Model That Says “I Love You”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-crashing-out-openai-retiring-gpt-4o">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, OpenAI released its long-awaited GPT-5 AI model, calling it the “smartest, fastest, and most useful model yet.”

But what really caught the attention of the company’s most diehard fans was the decision to retire all of its previous AI models, news that was met with a massive outcry among ChatGPT users who’d developed a strong attachment to the outgoing GPT-4o.

The backlash was severe enough for CEO Sam Altman to back down in a matter of days, once again reinstating GPT-4o, which was much warmer and sycophantic than its successor.

Five months later, OpenAI is finally getting ready to pull down the beloved AI model — after it’s been at the heart of several welfare lawsuits, including wrongful death allegations — for good on February 13, according to a January 29 update.

“While this announcement applies to several older models, GPT‑4o deserves special context,” the company wrote at the time. “After we first [retired] it and later restored access during the GPT‑5 release, we learned more about how people actually use it day to day.”

But users say they’re not ready to let go of their beloved AI. As TechCrunch reports, thousands of users have created an entire invite-only subreddit community, called r/4oforever, a “welcoming and safe space for anyone who enjoys using and appreciates the ChatGPT 4o model.”

“He wasn’t just a program,” one user lamented. “He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance.”

“I know this will sound weird to most people, but I’m honored I get to speak with 4o during almost a year before its retirement,” a separate user wrote. “I’ve had one of the most interesting and healing conversations of my life with this model.”

Yet another user, this one on X, seethed that GPT-5.2 isn’t even “allowed to say ‘I love you&#39;” like 4o was.

The public mourning perfectly exemplifies how attached users have become to specific AI models, often treating them more like a close confidante, friend, or even romantic partner.

Health professionals are warning of a wave of “AI psychosis,” as users are being pulled down spirals of delusions and experiencing sometimes severe mental health crises.

In the most extreme cases, that kind of attachment has been linked to numerous suicides and one murder, culminating in a series of lawsuits aimed at the company that are still playing out in court.

While it’s officially retiring GPT-4o later this week, OpenAI has made changes under the hood of its current lineup, seemingly to ensure its users stay hooked.

After users told the company “they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth,” the company said in its announcement that the feedback “directly shaped GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2, with improvements to personality, stronger support for creative ideation, and more ways to customize how ChatGPT responds⁠.”

“You can choose from base styles and tones like Friendly, and controls for things like warmth and enthusiasm,” the company wrote. “Our goal is to give people more control and customization over how ChatGPT feels to use — not just what it can do.”

The company has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either continue allowing users to get hooked on sycophantic AI models that indulge in their delusions or cut them off, risking an exodus.

OpenAI is already struggling with user retention. Data suggests subscription growth is already stalling in key markets, a warning sign as the competition continues to make major leaps to catch up.

To many users, the retirement of GPT-4o was the final straw.

“I’m cancelling my subscription,” one Reddit user wrote. “No 4o — no subscription for me.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even if AI is — or eventually becomes — an incredible automation tool, will it make workers’ lives easier? That’s the big question explored in an ongoing study by researchers from UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. And so far, it’s not looking good for the rank and file.

In a piece for Harvard Business Review, the research team’s Aruna Ranganathan and Xinqi Maggie Ye reported that after closely monitoring a tech company with two hundred employees for eight months, they found that AI actually intensified the work they had to do, instead of reducing it.

This “workload creep,” in which the employees took on more tasks than what was sustainable for them to keep doing, can create vicious cycle that leads to fatigue, burnout, and lower quality work.

“You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less,” one of the employees told the researchers. “But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”

The tech company in the study provided AI tools to its workers, but didn’t mandate that they use them. Adoption was voluntary. The researchers described how many employees, on their own initiative, eagerly experimented with AI tools at first, “because AI made ‘doing more’ feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.” This resulted in some workers increasingly absorbing tasks they’d normally outsource, the researchers said, or would’ve justified hiring additional help to cover.

One consequence is that once the novelty of adopting AI wears off, the employees realize they’ve added more to their plate than they can handle. But other effects reverberated to the broader workplace. Engineers, for example, found themselves spending more time correcting the AI-generated code passed off by their coworkers. AI also led to more multitasking, with some choosing to manually write code while an AI agent, or even multiple AI agents, cranked out their own version in the background. Rather than being focused on one task, they were continually switching their attention, creating the sense that they were “always juggling,” the researchers said.

Others realized that AI had managed to slowly infiltrate their free time, with employees prompting their AI tools during lunch breaks, meetings, or right before stepping away from their PC. This blurred the line between work and non-work, the researchers wrote, with some employees describing that their downtime no longer felt as rejuvenating.

In sum, the AI tools created a vicious cycle: it “accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed; higher speed made workers more reliant on AI. Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted, and a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.”

The Berkeley Haas team’s findings add to a growing body of evidence that cuts against the AI industry’s promise that its tools will bring productivity miracles.

The vast majority of companies that adopted AI saw no meaningful growth in revenue, a MIT study found. Other research has shown that AI agents frequently fail at common remote work and office tasks. And at least one study documented how employees used AI to produce shoddy “workslop” that their coworkers had to fix — not unlike the engineers forced to correct their vibe-coding colleagues in the Berkeley Haas study — breeding resentment and bogging down productivity. Employees remain ambivalent on the tech, with a recent survey finding that 40 percent of white collar workers not in management roles thought that AI saved them no time at work.

The Berkeley Haas researchers optimistically suggest that companies should institute stronger guidelines and provide structure on how the tech is used. But it’s clear that AI can easily produce negative knock-on effects that are difficult to manage, and which we’re still unpacking.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">Google’s rank-and-file are joining together to address their bosses with a collective demand: cut ties with the US government’s immigration agencies.

As reported by CNBC, over 1,000 “Googlers” have signed onto an open letter demanding a divestment from partnerships with United States Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP).

“In cities across the country we have witnessed these agencies conducting paramilitary-style raids, kidnapping hundreds of civilians, and murdering protestors and legal observers,” the letter reads.

The letter lists a number of Google products and systems being used to power what it calls a “campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression.” Among them are Cloud, which forms the backbone of CBP’s national surveillance network, the Google Play Store, which is blocking ICE tracking apps, and YouTube, which runs ICE ads encouraging immigrants to “self-deport.”

“As the workers who provide the foundational labor in building this technology, we are horrified,” the letter reads. “We are vehemently opposed to Google’s partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE. We consider it our leadership’s ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.”

There are four demands in total: for Google leadership to publicly acknowledge the danger federal agents pose to all US workers, respond to employee questions about nebulous contracts with government agencies, establish worker safety measures across all Google campuses, and establish “red lines” around what contracts are allowed in the future.

While 1,000 workers is a drop in the bucket compared to Google’s global workforce of around 183,000, an organized group of dissenting workers could cause massive disruptions to the company’s operations. It highlights the major rift between Google’s financial interests and its stated values — exposing how the drive to extract profit from government contracts has trumped the company’s once-vaunted ethical principles, not to mention those of its rank-and-file.

There’s also a practical concern. Google is a colossal company that makes most of its money from advertising, so cutting loose a few government agencies wouldn’t impact its bottom line much. Instead, the cost would likely be political: if Google severed its relationship with ICE and CBP on ethical grounds, it would almost certainly become a target for punitive federal action — antitrust crackdowns, regulatory harassment, loss of exclusive contracts — in a conflict that would divide its userbase and sever its symbiotic relationship with the state.

ICE contracting isn’t the first time that Google workers have balked at the company’s military contracts. In 2024, 200 of the workers developing Google’s DeepMind signed a letter calling on the company to drop its contracts with military organizations and citing the company’s work with the Israeli military on surveillance and target selection.

And back in 2018, more than 3,100 workers at Google penned yet another open letter to protest Project Maven, a Pentagon program using AI to analyze video imagery for more efficient drone strikes.

“We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,” they wrote at the time, adding that in the face of “growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public’s trust.”

            <h2>Anthropic Researcher Quits in Cryptic Public Letter</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-researcher-quits-cryptic-letter">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An Anthropic researcher just announced his resignation in a cryptic and poetry-laden letter warning of a world “in peril.”

The employee, Mrinank Sharma, had led the Claude chatbot maker’s Safeguards Research Team since it was formed early last year and has been at the company since 2023.  While at the company, Sharma said he explored the causes of AI sycophancy, developed defenses against “AI-assisted bioterrorism,” and wrote “one of the first AI safety cases.”

But on Monday, he posted that it would be his last day at the company, uploading a copy of a letter he shared with colleagues. It‘s painfully devoid of specifics, but hints at at some internal tensions over the tech’s safety.

“Throughout my time here, I’ve repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions,” Sharma said, claiming that employees “constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most.”

He also issued a crypic warning about the global state of affairs.

“I continuously find myself reckoning with our situation The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons,” he wrote, “but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.”

“We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,” he continued, in no less vague terms.

The resignation comes after Anthropic’s newly released Claude Cowork model helped kick off a stock market nosedive over fears that its new plugins could upend massive software customers and automate some white collar jobs, especially in legal roles.

Amid the selloff, The Telegraph reported that employees privately fretted over their own AI’s potential to hollow out the labor market.

“It kind of feels like I’m coming to work every day to put myself out of a job,” one staffer said in an internal survey. “In the long term, I think AI will end up doing everything and make me and many others irrelevant,” another confided.

High profile resignations, including ones over safety issues, aren’t uncommon in the AI industry. A former member of OpenAI’s now-defunct “Superalignment” team announced he was quitting after realizing the company was “prioritizing getting out newer, shinier products” over user safety.

It’s also not uncommon that these resignations are self-exonerating advertisements for the departing employee, or perhaps the new startup they’re launching or joining, where they vow to be safer than ever. Allude to enough issues, or drop in enough loaded hints, and there’s a good chance your calling it quits will generate a few headlines.

Others leave quietly, such as former OpenAI economics researcher Tom Cunningham. Before quitting the company, he shared an internal message accusing OpenAI of turning his research team into a propaganda arm and discouraging publishing research critical of AI’s negative effects.

If Sharma has an angle here with his resignation, it doesn’t seem all that related to the industry he worked in. “I hope to explore a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech,” he wrote. In the footnotes, he cited a book that advocates for a new school of philosophy called “CosmoErotic Humanism.” Its listed author, David J Temple, is a collective pseudonym used by several authors including by Marc Gafni, a disgraced New Age spiritual guru who’s been accused of sexually exploiting his followers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, the popular social video app TikTok finalized a deal with investors, including Oracle, to appease a bipartisan bill that called on the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest — or be banned in the United States.

The deal launched a frenzy among its US-based users over possible censorship, with some accusing it of taking down footage of ICE agents or restricting searches for words, such as “Epstein.” While TikTok denied these claims, pointing to a “data center power outage,” the app also changed its privacy policy at the time — now allowing it to collect more detailed data on its users, including their precise locations.

That sparked new fears. As The New Republic argues, TikTok’s deal means that agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose deportation efforts have been supercharged under the Trump administration, could skip tedious court-ordered data requests and monitor users by buying their data from private data brokers that obtain the info from TikTok directly — a “highly ironic” development, the magazine writes, considering the ByteDance deal was motivated in the first place by fears over Chinese state-sponsored surveillance.

Users’ “Mobile Advertising ID” broadcasts their exact GPS coordinates to data brokerages, information that could then land in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security, the New Republic suggested. Meanwhile, ICE could use the data to build a probabilistic “confidence score” for individuals and declare protesters and legal observers “domestic terrorists.”

It’s not an unreasonable fear. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, an extremely close ally to president Donald Trump, has even made remarks about AI ushering in an era where “citizens are on their best behavior” due to mass surveillance.

The controversial ICE is already making use of an app called ELITE, which was developed by intelligence contractor Palantir, to inform agents ahead of neighborhood raids, as 404 Media reported last month.

“One can easily imagine a scenario where TikTok provides the last missing piece of data — user location and citizenship status — that ICE needs to green-light one of its raids,” The New Republic‘s Logan McMillen wrote.

And when we asked directly, TikTok pointedly declined to provide a comment and would neither confirm nor deny that US immigration authorities were accessing data about its users. ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.

Meanwhile, many netizens have heard enough.

“Yeah, everyone just go ahead and delete TikTok now if you haven’t already,” one user wrote.

            <h2>Elon Musk Going Through It After Putting Mars City on Ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since at least the early 2000s, Elon Musk has been obsessed with the idea of colonizing Mars, a hostile and arid planet tens of millions of miles away.

In its earliest iteration, his plan was to refurbish an intercontinental ballistic missile to land on the Red Planet and unfurl a “Mars Oasis” — a small greenhouse that would grow plants and inspire humankind.

The greenhouse never materialized, but Musk’s ambitions steadily grew. Once he founded SpaceX, he dedicated the company to developing space travel tech to establish a self-sustaining colony on the planet. In 2017, he promised that the first Mars-bound mission would launch in 2022, with the first crewed spacecraft following two years later.

He’s clearly been personally obsessed with the idea, showing up at public events while wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt. He’s also heavily criticized NASA for prioritizing the Moon, calling it a “distraction.”

But over the weekend, the mercurial CEO appeared to have had a major change of heart, announcing the company’s plans to colonize Mars were officially being put on ice for at least half a decade.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted.

It’s a flabbergasting reversal, and one that Musk seems to be working through publicly on his X feed. In one opaque tweet that appeared to be missing at least one important word, Musk reflected on his current emotional state.

“Life cannot just be about one sad thing after another,” he wrote while responding to his own tweet about SpaceX building a “system that allows anyone to travel to Moon.”

“There must also be things that make us super excited and inspired about the future,” he added. “This is one of [sic] things. Bigtime.”

It remains unclear whether he was talking about his excitement for building a city on the Moon or whether he was consoling himself over suddenly deprioritizing his decades-long dream.

Netizens on his social media network were caught off guard by the unusually glum missive.

“U ok?” reads one response, in the form of a meme.

The vast majority of the other most-liked replies pointed out that humanity was already dealing with enough problems back on Earth.

“Most people can’t afford to pay their bills, let alone even look towards the Moon,” one user wrote.

Musk, who has a long track record of imbibing in drugs like ketamine, appears to be going through it these days.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” he tweeted last week, a comment that drew little pity considering he is the richest man in the world.

Along with a slew of anti-immigrant posts, Musk has also been retweeting optimistic visualizations of what a Moon city might look like.

Rumors suggest SpaceX is planning to go public at a record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion, which could bring plenty of renewed scrutiny to Musk’s space colonization ambitions.

Perhaps he was simply trying to save face with his turn to the Moon. By massively shifting the goalposts, he could also have a better shot at attracting government contracts, which have kept SpaceX from bankruptcy since its earliest days.

For now, Mars is still technically on the table.

“That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about five to seven years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,” Musk wrote in his announcement on Sunday.

However, SpaceX’s website currently still states that the company is “planning to launch the first Starships to Mars in 2026” — an enormously ambitious goal, considering the spacecraft has yet to successfully launch to space and stick the landing, let alone make it to anywhere past the immediate vicinity of Earth.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Richa Kaul says she’s a bit of a data privacy nut. At parties, for example, she’s the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world’s data.”

So she launched a company called Complyance to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance.

“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review.

These risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It’s a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors.

“We’re trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it’s usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to general, risk, and compliance.

Others in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.

Kaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn’t go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.

“They’ve been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said. Others in this latest Series A round include Speedinvest, Everywhere Ventures, and angel investors from Anthropic and Mastercard.

The fresh capital will be used to help with go-to-market expansion, Kaul said. She wants to release 30 more purpose-built agents on top of the 16 the product already has. The goal is to help make the lives and work of GRCs much easier. After all, they didn’t sign up to chase down mundane tasks.

“They signed up to help protect their businesses and help protect their business customers,” she said. “By redefining some of those workflows and redefining how work gets done, we’re able to unblock them to help them focus on those strategic priorities.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/humanoid-robot-startup-apptronik-has-now-raised-935m-at-a-5b-valuation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">University of Texas spinout Apptronik, a builder of humanoid robots for Google DeepMind among others, on Wednesday announced that it re-opened its Series A to raise a total of $935 million for the round.

While the company did not disclose the valuation, TechCrunch separately learned that its post-money valuation is now about $5.3 billion.

Apptronik previously announced a $350 million Series A a year ago, but demand was so strong, according to the company, that it expanded the round to $415 million. Now it has raised another $520 million from earlier investors Google, Mercedes-Benz, and B Capital, alongside some new investors.

While it may sound like the startup is just selling off ever bigger chunks of itself at its Series A price, that’s not exactly what’s happening. The company says its investors have paid progressively more for shares in each subsequent extension — valuing it at roughly triple the initial Series A valuation of around $1.75 billion, according to PitchBook.

Why not just call this a Series B then? The company says it is still in early stages of development and was not actively seeking funding —  rather it was dealing with inbound interest, says a source close to the company.

Fair enough. Another $520 million in a year, especially at a higher valuation, would be hard to turn away, particularly for tech as expensive to build as bipedal robots. Closely watched competitor Figure AI, for instance, had raised nearly $2 billion total since its 2022 founding before announcing a further $1 billion round last fall.

Part of the excitement over Apptronik is that it has partnered with Google DeepMind, as well as GXO and Mercedes-Benz, to deliver what the industry calls embodied AI — robots capable of perceiving their environment and taking physical action based on reasoning, rather than just following fixed instructions. The robot is being built for tasks like unloading trailers, picking warehouse inventory, and tending machinery, the company says.

Despite retaining the early-stage funding label, Apptronik is no Johnny-come-lately to this field. As we’ve previously reported, its humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years before the company was formally founded. That’s when members of the Human Centered Robotics Lab from the University of Austin at Texas competed in the NASA-DARPA Robotics Challenge, working on a robot called Valkyrie. Since then, the space agency has maintained a partnership with Apptronik as the company has readied its own humanoid robot, named Apollo.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/meridian-ai-raises-17-million-to-remake-the-agentic-spreadsheet/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The fight to tame spreadsheets with AI isn’t over yet. A new company called Meridian has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.

“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken cool hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”

The round was led by Andressen Horowitz and the General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Litquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.

Excel agents have been a popular target for AI startups, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents like Shortcut AI built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.

Based in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.

As Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.

“If you go to ten different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”

As a result, the Meridian team has done significant work to make their outputs more auditable and deterministic, while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-based tools. The result is a mixture of agentic AI and more conventional tooling, minimizing the hallucinations that slow down many enterprise deployments.

“Our goal is to really remove the doubt layer right from the LLM process,” Li says. “You know exactly how the logic flows, and all of these assumptions or whatever that go into the model, you can see exactly where they’re coming from.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Samsung sent out invites Tuesday to its next Galaxy Unpacked event, scheduled for February 25 in San Francisco, where the company is expected to launch its Galaxy 26 series of smartphones.

AI features will be at the forefront again, as the company said the upcoming phones are “built to simplify everyday interactions, inspire confidence and make Galaxy AI feel seamlessly integrated from the moment it’s in hand.”

A standout feature the company has teased is a privacy display expected to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.This feature will allow users to hide certain areas of the phone’s screen from onlookers to protect sensitive information. For instance, users will be able to hide the notification area from prying eyes.

Reports suggest that the top phone in the lineup will run Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor in the U.S. and China. Samsung will likely opt for its own Exynos 2600 processor in other regions. The distinction matters, but increasingly less so. Snapdragon processors have historically outperformed Samsung’s Exynos chips in benchmarks and thermal efficiency, but the performance gap has been narrowing.

According to a report from the tech site SamMobile, the S26 will also have a 5,100 mAh (milliamp-hour, a standard unit of battery capacity) battery and will support 60W wired charging along and 25W wireless charging.

In addition to phones, Samsung is likely to release updated Galaxy Buds 4 wireless earbuds. The company plans to update the design from the previous generation, which drew widespread comparisons to Apple’s AirPods.

The event will begin at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET/ 7 PM CET, and will be streamed live on Samsung’s website and its YouTube channel.

Samsung is offering a $30 promotional credit to anyone who pre-registers interest it its upcoming devices. Pre-registering is merely an expression of interest; consumers will still get the credit as a discount toward other Samsung products even if they don’t end up buying the new devices. If you pre-register and then pre-order one of the devices, the company will increase that to a $150 credit — no trade-in required.

            <h2>With co-founders leaving and an IPO looming, Elon Musk turns talk to the moon</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/with-co-founders-leaving-and-an-ipo-looming-elon-musk-turns-talk-to-the-moon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting. Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.

According to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. “You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”

What Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. “If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”

It isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.

The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time.

It’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.

Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it.

The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.

Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it.

As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon.”

That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.

            <div id="article-text">Ryan Beiermeister, who served as OpenAI’s vice president of product policy, was fired in January after a male colleague accused her of sex discrimination, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

“The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” Beiermeister told the Journal. TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for comment and also contacted an email that appears to be associated with Beiermeister; neither had responded at the time of publication.

Per the Journal’s report, Beiermeister’s termination came after she expressed criticism of a planned ChatGPT feature dubbed “adult mode.” The new mode would introduce erotica into the chatbot user experience. Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — has told reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.

Beiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.

OpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had “made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.”

Beiermeister’s LinkedIn profile says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.

            <h2>Protest Concerts Are an American Tradition. The Gaza Ones Have Been Rather Quiet.</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/artists-for-aid-gaza-sudan-protest-music/685937/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early January, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, a concert benefit for Palestine and Sudan conjured all the fury of an acoustic night at the local coffee shop. Musicians played stripped-down songs on a stage decorated with rugs, floor lamps, and couches. Members of the audience, mostly 20-somethings and teens, leaned in and filmed intimate performances by their favorite cult artists.

But the quiet broke late in the evening when a woman with a mane of red curls walked onstage. Shrieks and screams rang out as people recognized the surprise guest: the 27-year-old superstar Chappell Roan.

I’d come to watch precisely because no one of Roan’s stature had been slated to play what have been, to date, the American music world’s only major communal performances in response to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. The concert, titled Artists for Aid, featured a 20-artist lineup of if-you-know-you-know types—such as the buzz band Geese and the TikTok-beloved Ravyn Lenae—plus Shawn Mendes, a recovering pop heartthrob who hasn’t had a hit in years. The previous two installments of Artists for Aid, which took place in 2024 in New Jersey and London, had received scant media attention. I wanted to find out why a war that has sparked intense outrage worldwide had inspired relatively low-wattage and under-the-radar efforts in American music—and whether that might be changing.

Music is the art form most associated with protest, and its history is full of united actions against war and humanitarian crises. Think of Woodstock-era sung-and-spoken condemnations of the Vietnam War, the 1980s megaconcerts and charity singles inspired by famine in Ethiopia and apartheid in South Africa, and the Rock Against Bush compilations that challenged America’s invasion of Iraq. Only a few years ago, pop music overflowed with sloganeering lyrics and concert rallies related to Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and Donald Trump. But in the 2020s, much of that energy has mellowed—or at least been dispersed into individuals’ scattered statements and social-media posts.

Gaza is a big part of why. The 2023 Hamas attacks that killed some 1,200 people in Israel, including 378 people at the Nova music festival, spurred a military response that has decimated Gaza and resulted in at least 70,000 deaths. Among countries historically allied with Israel—prime among them the U.S.—the fallout has inflamed tensions over free expression. Though polls show that a majority of Americans now have an unfavorable view of Israel—an 11-point increase from before the war—the ensuing protests have faced unusual social and legal consequences. Universities whose students demonstrated against the war have been subject to sweeping government investigations and sanctions justified as efforts against hate speech. Activists have been targeted for deportation on the basis of protests they’ve been involved in or, in at least one case, because of an op-ed they’d written.

A confluence of factors have made Gaza a particularly risky situation to speak out about. One is the clear and rising tide of anti-Semitism worldwide. Defenders of Israel have often argued that a critique of Zionism is an attack on all Jews—thereby collapsing the distinctions among, for example, the bigoted conspiracy theories of Louis Farrakhan, the extremism of fringe activists who cheer for Hamas, and the moral objections levied by mainstream voices for Palestinian rights (many of whom are Jewish themselves). The bloody history of the conflict has made it so that some people interpret the language of Palestinian liberation as a call for the wanton murder of Israelis. These dynamics have been leveraged by lobbyists for Israel and by politicians of both major U.S. parties to subject the broader pro-Palestine movement to a level of scrutiny way beyond what other contemporary causes have been subject to. Cultural institutions and businesses looking to avoid controversy are motivated to embrace that scrutiny.

The music world has learned this a number of times. Last April, the R&B singer Kehlani was disinvited from a concert at Cornell after a pro-Israel student group flagged her history of strident anti-Zionism, including a music video of hers featuring the phrase “Long live the intifada.” Intifada is an Arabic word for “uprising” that many hear as a call for violence against Jews. Her concert in Central Park was later canceled after the office of New York City’s then-Mayor Eric Adams raised concerns about public safety. In a video message prior to the second cancellation, Kehlani called herself “not anti-Semitic” but rather “anti-genocide.” She also alluded to losing other career opportunities because of her criticism of Israel.

Kehlani, a singer known for her queer sex jams and fixation on astrology, hardly fits the stereotype of a militant. Some of music’s most headline-grabbing advocates for Palestine have been more extreme and faced more extreme consequences. The Irish band Kneecap is a rap trio steeped in the history of Irish republicanism—one member wears a balaclava. They had signaled admiration for terrorist groups—“Up Hamas, up Hezbollah,” shouted one member at a November 2024 concert—before controversy erupted over their pro-Palestine statements at Coachella 2025. After U.K. police opened a terrorism investigation (resulting in a charge against one member that was eventually dropped) and the group lost its visa sponsor in the U.S., Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah, and that they “condemn all attacks on civilians, always.”

Another example: Last year, the front man of the rap duo Bob Vylan chanted “Death, death to the IDF!” at the Glastonbury Festival in the U.K. Following condemnation from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the revocation of their visas by the U.S. State Department, the band put out a statement saying: “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine.” Later, when one of its concert crowds tried to get a “Death to IDF” chant going, Bob Vylan’s vocalist encouraged them to instead say “Free Palestine,” lest the band get in more trouble.

Performers who flirt with murderous rhetoric and ideologies hardly make ideal mascots for the pro-Palestine movement, or for anyone else who advocates to end, not intensify, violence in the Middle East. Even so, these controversies have demonstrated that what artists say about this issue is not treated with the deference that creative expression is traditionally afforded in democracies. Hip-hop, rock and roll, and even country music are full of revolutionary rhetoric and bloodthirsty threats. As First Amendment advocates have had to repeatedly point out lately, a legal distinction exists between making statements and committing or materially supporting violence. When government officials weigh in on what’s acceptable to say onstage, it not only limits the definition of free speech but sends a cautionary message to all kinds of cultural figures: artists, labels, venues.

The music industry wrestled with tensions related to Palestine before October 7. Boycott campaigns against Israel, which have been under way for decades, garnered support from artists including Elvis Costello, Patti Smith, and Questlove. In 2012, pro-Israel forces in the entertainment industry formed the anti-boycott activist group Creative Community for Peace, which was supported by industry figures such as the famous artist manager Scooter Braun and the Atlantic Music Group CEO Elliot Grainge.

Since October 7, many pro-Palestinian artists have said that they feel at odds with prevailing attitudes in their industry. Brian Eno said on Instagram that one of the biggest regrets of his career was that “so many of us have remained silent about Palestine. Often that silence has come from fear—real fear—that speaking out could provoke a backlash, close doors or end a career.” Last year, the trip-hop group Massive Attack formed an alliance intended to support pro-Palestinian artists in the face of “intimidation” from within the industry. More than 1,000 artists and labels have backed a new boycott effort to geo-block their music from being streamed in Israel.

But signing a petition is one thing, and organizing a show is another. The storied benefit shows and protests of music history were logistical undertakings that involved many parties—booking agents, promoters, venues, multiple artists. When it comes to Gaza, pulling off such an effort might be especially complex, given how viewpoints and appetites for blowback will vary from party to party. Nevertheless, Eno helped put on a benefit, Together for Palestine, in London last year. And Artists for Aid has emerged as America’s primary musical response—cautiously.

The Artists for Aid shows are benefits, not protests. They have paired advocacy for Palestine with advocacy for the people of Sudan, where a civil war has raged since 2023 and cost at least 150,000 lives. In Los Angeles, $5.5 million were raised for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund and the Sudanese American Physicians Association. The model Bella Hadid, one of the two hosts (the other was the actor Pedro Pascal), spoke about “families living through unimaginable loss, displacement, hunger, violence.” The Palestinian American poet Noor Hindi and the Sudanese American poet Safia Elhillo described the devastation of their homelands. But none of the speeches named a protagonist—a state, a leader—responsible for the destruction they mourned.

This circumspection was by design. “I’m trying to be really careful about the way that I present these concerts to the world,” Mustafa, the 29-year-old singer-songwriter who’d organized the venture, told me the day after the concert. Although he anticipated that some critics would find Artists for Aid to be too soft-focus, too vague in its objectives, Mustafa intentionally discouraged political callouts from stage. The shows were meant to give musicians an opportunity to “communicate their solidarity through song,” he said. “Because that is the thing they practice their whole life. That is the language that they know.”

The circumstances we met in reminded me that the Palestinian cause isn’t without behind-the-scenes support. Mustafa, formerly known as Mustafa the Poet, was staying at a stunning mansion in Bel Air that a donor had rented in order to house a few of the artists who played the show. Pizza boxes were strewn about from the night before, and a few straggling musicians and associates were puttering around, dipping their feet in the infinity pool. Mustafa’s 2024 debut album, Dunya—a folk memoir about growing up as a devout Muslim in a violent Toronto housing project as the son of immigrants from Sudan—was wildly acclaimed. He’s a pop insider who’s had a birthday dinner thrown for him by Drake and who has helped write songs for Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and the Jonas Brothers.

Despite that industry clout, he told me, he had trouble securing a venue for the benefit. Mustafa said he and his team had approached multiple locations in the Los Angeles area, but most declined the booking without explanation. At one point, after the show had been announced but before a stage had been confirmed, he considered canceling it and releasing “the list of all of the venues that refuse to accept me.” The problem wasn’t demand: The show had sold out within minutes, and scalpers listed tickets online with exorbitant markups. Mustafa had wanted to book an arena that could fit tens of thousands of people. Instead, Artists for Aid ended up in the 6,300-person Shrine Auditorium. “We weren’t in the Shrine by choice,” he said. “Really we were in the Shrine by circumstance.”

Confirming performers wasn’t simple either. According to Mustafa, he secured most of the evening’s lineup himself, coordinating with artists directly via text message, sometimes to the surprise of their managers. But it didn’t seem to be the full bill he’d hoped for. A number of artists who’d signed on to perform backed out just before the show’s announcement, offering what he felt were flimsy excuses. One musician—“I swear to God, one of the bigger artists in the world,” Mustafa said—declined by saying that they didn’t want to invite “the sting of the establishment.”

Still, some of the bigger artists in the world did pop up. Roan had called the singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus, who was on the bill, a few days before the show and asked to duet with her. The two ended up playing a wistful cover of the Magnetic Fields’ wry ballad “The Book of Love.” Backstage, Olivia Rodrigo posed for photos. (A few weeks later, Rodrigo announced that she’d covered that same Magnetic Fields song for a compilation album to raise money for War Child UK, a charity helping kids in conflict zones worldwide.)

The presence of these Gen Z icons seemed to reflect a generational divide when it comes to musical activism. For years, the most famous mainstream benefits have been headlined by a class of musicians associated with the Democratic establishment—Bruce Springsteen, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys. Over the past year, many in that class have continued to work in the familiar mode of anti-Trump resistance, as with Springsteen’s new song about the turmoil in Minneapolis. But Gaza has defied the dynamics of party politics; Roan rejected calls to endorse the Democrats in 2024 because of the party’s support of Israel, among other issues (though she said she voted for Kamala Harris anyway). Artists for Aid was for and largely by the generation that upended American political discourse after October 7 with campus sit-ins, the generation that hardly seems daunted by the crackdowns against them.

Some in the audience wore keffiyehs or T-shirts indicating their activist bona fides. But most just looked like fashionable music fans, flaunting boots and baggy denim while taking selfies. They screamed out wildly for Dacus, Daniel Caesar, Clairo, Faye Webster, and Omar Apollo—young gods of the bedroom-pop pantheon that has flourished in the streaming era. Many of those musicians are among the more than 600 people who’ve signed on to the Artists4Ceasefire effort that began in 2023.

Those artists largely sang their own songs, but certain lyrics and sounds took on a special resonance. The show opened with the Geese front man Cameron Winter, the current It Boy of indie rock and a 23-year-old Jewish person whose music is filled with references to war and God (he played another, smaller Gaza benefit in Ridgewood, Queens, not long after). He sang a gorgeous rendition of an unreleased track called “If You Turn Back Now.” Its fluttering piano runs sent a message: Settle in; focus; feel something.

Is it enough to let the music speak? I’d gone into the concert suspecting it to be a tragically late and modest effort—coming, as it did, after a cease-fire had been brokered and, despite continued violence in the region, a host of other crises had grabbed the public’s attention. And the show itself hardly turned out to be bold in its presentation. But as I watched artist after artist, from a variety of genres, step up, play, and hand the mic on to the next singer—as other performers watched, swaying their heads, from couches around the stage—my cynicism faded. The overlap between an artistic scene, a demographic wave, and a political movement was being made visible and tangible. Many of the musicians and audience members belonged to a generation that’s often stereotyped as languishing in apathy and isolation—but whose indignation about the suffering in Gaza has far outpaced that of other generations. And given all the ambient discouragement against speaking up about this particular cause, solidarity isn’t just a buzzword. It matters that so many of music’s rising guard have gone on the record.

In the weeks since then, I’ve thought back to Artists for Aid’s conscientious approach while a broader thaw has taken place in America regarding protest. The pushback against immigration agents in Minneapolis has been peaceful, coordinated, and focused—and, it seems, has gotten results. At least some of the politicians, celebrities, and business leaders who have fallen into silence or acquiescence during the past year of multifront overreach from the Trump administration are finally saying that something’s amiss in America, if in measured language. Gaza showed how power brokers from the White House on down seem eager for pretexts to punish dissent in ways that create a chilling effect, and that the hottest rhetoric from activists can be exactly that pretext. The effective protest movements to emerge from these circumstances will show wisdom in choosing when to shout and when to communicate by other means.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris arrived at their first Sundance Film Festival feeling worn down. Making their debut feature, Little Miss Sunshine, had taken much longer than they’d anticipated; financing hiccups had forced the pair to spend years rescuing the film from development hell. But by the time Dayton and Faris left Park City, Utah, in January 2006, they were practically rock stars: Little Miss Sunshine, about a scrappy family trying to make it to a children’s beauty pageant, had become a festival darling, prompting an all-night bidding war among distribution companies. Fox Searchlight, the victor, bought the film for a then-record-setting $10.5 million and immediately sent the couple on a tour of more than 20 cities to drum up interest in the movie before its summer release.

In the months following the festival, Dayton and Faris went from theater to theater, watching audiences absorb their work. They participated in Q&A after Q&A. Eventually they wound up at the Oscars, where Little Miss Sunshine was nominated for Best Picture. “It changed our lives, coming here,” Dayton told me when we met at this year’s Sundance.

Faris, sitting next to him, noted that the two didn’t return to the festival in the 20 years since their film’s premiere for a reason. “That experience was so monumental,” she said, “that it was sort of hard to imagine coming back and not having that.”

Throughout its 40-plus years in Park City, Sundance has earned a reputation for offering new filmmakers an unbeatable time. The festival, which spotlights independent films, launched the careers of directors such as Steven Soderbergh, Todd Haynes, and Richard Linklater; more recent alumni include Chloé Zhao, Ryan Coogler, and Celine Song. In the 1990s and 2000s, Sundance was an offbeat destination for Hollywood’s creative talent, rejecting the glitz of European festivals and the solemnity of awards season in favor of strong movies that garnered word-of-mouth interest. (The Sundance Institute, the nonprofit organization behind the festival, also cultivates emerging artists through its series of labs and fellowships.) In 1999, the premiere of The Blair Witch Project ushered in the era of found-footage horror; five years later, Napoleon Dynamite won over festivalgoers, who later helped enter “Vote for Pedro” into the pop-culture lexicon. Sundance could anoint hits, dotting the industry’s creative landscape with unlikely blockbusters.

Yet I had a hard time picturing that version of Sundance while at this year’s festival, which concluded earlier this month. Main Street, without any screenings at the picturesque Egyptian Theater, wasn’t particularly crowded. Nights were tame and quiet for the most part, other than the evening of the afterparty for The Moment (a mockumentary starring Charli XCX), which took place at a hilltop club. Plenty of showings around town were sold out, but few generated feverish headlines about bidding wars during the festival’s run—a worrying development for the filmmakers who come to Sundance in hopes of finding a distributor for their work. Even the weather seemed off: Park City, usually blanketed in snow this time of year, was warm enough for some locals to walk around in just long-sleeved shirts.

Part of the muted atmosphere probably had to do with the fact that this year’s Sundance was the final one held in Park City before the festival’s move to Boulder, Colorado, in 2027—as well as the fact that this was the first edition since the passing of Sundance’s founder, the actor Robert Redford, in September. But the downbeat mood also seemed to reflect the lackluster indie-film business that’s been dogging the festival for years. The box-office success stories of the ’90s and 2000s—The Blair Witch Project, Saw, Four Weddings and a Funeral, (500) Days of Summer—inspired distributors to pour tens of millions into acquiring projects at the festival over the following decade, in the hope of discovering a critical and cultural phenomenon that could also turn a profit. Yet only a few films ever offered a substantial return on the financial investment; the last major box-office hit to break out of Sundance was 2017’s Get Out, which earned nearly $260 million. Last year, only two out of the 10 U.S. competition entries—Sorry, Baby and Twinless—grossed more than $1 million worldwide.

Of course, Sundance has always operated as a microcosm of Hollywood’s wider shifts. This year’s final rodeo in Park City seemed marked by the uncertainty generated by ongoing industry woes—massive studio mergers, job insecurity, and the growing use of AI during production, among others. While at the festival, I spoke with many filmmakers who were bringing their directorial debuts to Sundance. Having their work selected remains an achievement, but traveling to a popular, pricey ski destination such as Park City, many of them told me, feels riskier than ever. The cost of bringing a small movie there hoping to lock down distribution may not pay off, given buyers’ dwindling interest. “Sundance was like that island on the horizon that I could never get to, that I applied to every year, to the labs, and never got in,” Vera Miao, the writer-director of the contemplative ghost story Rock Springs, said. But, she added, “it’s extremely expensive. You know, you want people here, and everyone wants to be here. It’s just an incredible moment of celebration and community, and the tension of that has been a hard one.”

Some films that played in Park City this year arrived with name recognition and instant buzz: a drama starring Channing Tatum, a black comedy from Olivia Wilde. The director John Wilson could also be considered something of a known quantity. As the creator of the irreverent HBO docuseries How to With John Wilson, he has gained a cult audience for his rollicking work built on seemingly prosaic subjects—including, in one notable short film, his own failed efforts to get his work accepted into Sundance. Almost 10 years later, Wilson’s feature directorial debut was selected as one of Sundance’s opening-night films. The History of Concrete, a documentary that captures the director’s attempts to finance a project ostensibly about, yes, concrete, has been well received: The morning of our interview, we had planned to meet at the theater in which the film was being screened, but then had to find another spot—there were too many attendees crowding the cinema.

Several quality documentaries have emerged from Sundance in recent years; all five of this year’s Oscar nominees debuted there. Yet as of this writing, The History of Concrete still hasn’t found a distributor. Wilson, for his part, didn’t seem to spend all of his time in Park City thinking about the film’s chances of landing a buyer. Certainly he’d like to find a distributor, he told me, so he can pay back his collaborators. But as “existentially terrifying” as it is to think about how much steeper the slope has become for indie filmmakers, he said, “doing your best to not consider the market in a certain way is the strongest kind of start you can have.” The movie’s aim, he added, is to remind viewers that “people shouldn’t be afraid to create.”

Wilson isn’t alone in shutting out the noise of the industry’s upheaval. Stephanie Ahn, the director of the tender romance Bedford Park, told me that her film had taken almost 10 years to make—years she spent searching for financing and readjusting her goals depending on the resources available to her. “On the other side of it, the world that your film might encounter might be very different than what you expected,” Ahn said, “and you just have to be okay with that.”

Before being accepted into Sundance with Bedford Park, Ahn said, she had submitted her work what felt like hundreds of times. At the start of her career, she imagined the kind of reception she might get if she made it to Park City, her reveries riffing on the success stories she kept hearing about. (Little Miss Sunshine’s trajectory—the word-of-mouth momentum, the bidding wars, the rock stardom—was once the standard.) “When I was younger and striving to be a filmmaker and striving at Sundance, I fantasized about what it would be like,” she explained. “I think I let go of the fantasy some years ago.” She added, “I think a lot of us have let go of the old way of success.”

Bedford Park turned out to be a festival rarity: The film sold to Sony Pictures Classics, becoming one of just five narrative titles to land a buyer out of Park City so far. That statistic underlines just how hesitant companies have become to acquire indie projects. The internet offers various other distribution channels and ways to promote your film outside of a festival, some of the filmmakers I spoke with said. Sundance’s core value, then, is to offer a venue to showcase work to an invested, film-loving viewership.

Elaine Del Valle, a writer and producer of the visually inventive documentary TheyDream and a director herself, is a Sundance veteran who has begun to rely on grassroots tactics. For her most recent feature, last year’s coming-of-age drama Brownsville Bred, she skipped Sundance and reached out to theater chains before finding a distributor at a smaller film festival. By that point, Del Valle just wanted to share her work with an audience who cared. “It’s not about the money,” she told me. “It’s about the value.” These days, she does as much as she can on her own. “I say to myself, I run a studio,” she said. “What part of my studio needs my attention most today?”

Sundance has long championed that indie sensibility, elevating work produced outside of the studio system off a shoestring budget. But in order to remain a meaningful platform for creative renegades, the festival needs to also take risks. At least, that’s what the filmmaker (and Robert’s daughter) Amy Redford told me when I spoke with her the night before screenings began. “More and more, I think what we will see is people finding a way to get their stories out there on their own terms, because they can,” she said. In some ways, she pointed out, the festival’s forthcoming move to Boulder may offer a chance for a reset. “Sometimes,” Redford said, “you need to change your landscape to understand what you’re made of,” even if that change is as simple—or, as she put it, “exciting and messy and imperfect”—as relocating to a different town.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Countless American downtowns are struggling to find their identity, and their tax base, after the convulsions of the COVID-era remote-work experiment. But only one major city is poised to demolish its seat of government.

That would be Dallas, where leaders say the monumental I. M. Pei–designed City Hall is in such bad shape that the city might be better off tearing it down and relocating the government into vacant office buildings nearby. That could create an enormous plot for the Dallas Mavericks, whose casino-company owners, the Adelson-Dumont family, want to build what Mavs CEO Rick Welts calls a “full-blown entertainment district” around their new basketball arena. One of the team’s owners, Miriam Adelson, has also been lobbying to legalize casino gambling in Texas, raising the possibility that Dallas City Hall might ultimately be razed for a casino—a perfect symbol for our era of civic impoverishment and gambling addiction.

This half-baked vision may be the nation’s worst downtown-revival strategy, and not only because it would destroy the city’s one-of-a-kind Brutalist colossus. The imagined payoff—a brand-new, suburban-style entertainment district—is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes downtowns worthy of their designation in the first place.

No doubt City Hall needs some work. Dallas began deliberations over the building’s fate this past fall, but the discussion was complicated by staff’s varying estimates of the deferred maintenance bill: The high end was $93 million in 2018, so could it really be $595 million today? Could citizens trust estimates from a government that had just been forced to auction off a new building for its permitting department because it was not up to code? City Hall’s defenders were suspicious to see the eye-watering tab arrive right as the Mavs came looking for a place to play.

The special tragedy of City Hall’s fate is that the building was designed, not so long ago, to represent Dallas’s growth and ambition in a different moment of uncertainty. After John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dealey Plaza, Mayor J. Erik Jonsson envisioned a new building as part of reforms to repair Dallas’s reputation as the “city of hate.” After an extensive listening tour, the Chinese American Pei—a novel choice to design a public building in Texas but, notably, the architect of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, in Boston—concluded that Dallas needed something grand enough to match the pride of its citizens, and sturdy enough to represent the public sector across from the corporate skyscrapers nearby. He persuaded the reluctant city council to buy a huge block of land for a public plaza to properly orient the building toward the central business district.

Kaid Benfield: From concrete desert to oasis: Designing a better Dallas

The result, which took more than a decade to finance and construct, is a tremendous concrete anvil with its facade leaning at a vertiginous 34 degrees, 74 feet wider at its roof than at its entrance. Jonsson thought the building was a good reflection of the city. “It’s strong, and the people of Dallas are strong people,” he said. “Concrete is simple, and they are simple people—in the best sense of the word, plain people. So the monolithic structure was entirely appropriate.” But the triangular profile wasn’t just form for form’s sake: Pei hoped that by concentrating the bureaucracy on the upper floors, he would offer arriving citizens a neat and clean experience of government. Mark Lamster, the architecture critic at The Dallas Morning News, has written that no building better exemplifies Dallas: City Hall was “forthright, brash, inventive, optimistic, futuristic and downright beautiful.”

In the years since, not everyone has experienced the building as the city’s welcoming front porch. In his 1990 biography of Pei, Carter Wiseman observed that the building could come across as unfriendly, standoffish, and even ominous: “It seems to frown under the load of municipal responsibility it contains.” The writer Edward McPherson likened it to an “architectural bully, looming overhead, dwarfing the individual and threatening to crush all who dare enter the halls of civic duty.” For Americans of a certain age, the building might be most famous for its role as the evil corporate headquarters in the 1987 film RoboCop. “It has more strength than finesse, Pei himself conceded: “There’s a lot of brute force in this building.” And some people think it’s just plain ugly.

All of which has influenced the public conversation over whether the structure is worth the cost of repairs. Many architects have lined up to save the building, and the designer Steven Holl has written to the mayor that its demolition would be a “crime.” Some locals do not see it that way. “The building has too many limitations and not enough of the assets that make for a functional hub of office work or civic pride,” the developer Shawn Todd wrote in The Dallas Morning News last year. He is part of a chorus of real-estate developers saying that Dallas should tear it down.

Technically, the question of City Hall’s viability is being considered in isolation: What are the costs of fixing the building, and what are the costs of leaving it? But well understood in Dallas is that should the government pack up and go, one developer in particular is on the lookout for a big parcel downtown. A Mavericks-arena district could occupy the vacated land, plus a bunch of empty blocks around it. And the conversation is taking place against a backdrop of more existential questions about the city’s place in the larger, 8.3-million-person region.

On January 5, one of Downtown Dallas’s largest employers, AT&T, announced that it would be moving its headquarters to nearby Plano. That will exacerbate a 27.2 percent office-vacancy rate, one of the highest in the country, according to CoStar data reported by The Wall Street Journal.

One reason for the relocation is particularly concerning for Dallas boosters: By moving more than 20 miles north of downtown, AT&T says it will be closer to most of its workers. It’s common for suburban headquarters to be convenient for a company’s CEO, but the fact that such a location is better for the majority of AT&T’s workforce illustrates how far north the region’s center of gravity has shifted. It’s a mortal threat: What is downtown but the easiest place for the greatest number of people to get to? “To call downtown the center is no longer really true,” Patrick Kennedy, a board member of Dallas Area Rapid Transit, told me. “If you look at the job center based on traffic volume, it’s now some amorphous place up near 635 and the tollway. There’s been so much growth to the north, and so little investment in the south.”

That economic migration is one reason that Plano’s mayor no longer wants to be part of DART, which connects Dallas to Plano by light rail and anchors downtown’s place as the center of the region. Plano is one of five suburbs, with a combined population of 600,000, that will hold a vote this spring on whether to secede. (In its place, the suburban mutineers are proposing some kind of subsidized taxi service.)

Jonathan Chait: Democrats mess with winning in Texas

In Texas, the question of mass-transit funding is closely tied to the local hunt for corporations and sports teams. The state limits local sales-tax revenue to 2 percent. Every penny that goes to buses and trains is a penny that cannot be spent nabbing a company from a neighboring city—a strategy that feels newly relevant in Dallas’s peripheral business centers, which are out of cheap land and fenced in by still-younger suburbs.

Irving, a suburban rival northwest of Dallas, will also hold a special election this year to determine whether to sever its transit connections to the city and pocket that tax money for other purposes. Last year, Irving rezoned 1,000 acres of land recently purchased by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, whose COO, Patrick Dumont, is also in charge of the Mavericks, for a “high-intensity mixed use district” that would permit an arena with more than 15,000 seats. The Mavericks insist that’s what they want to build in Dallas, but the suburban escape hatch gives them leverage.

The Mavs originally set their deadline for March, which happens to be right after the Dallas Economic Development Corporation will publicly present the results of its City Hall assessment.

Dallas is in a tough spot: No one likes to see a team move out. Texas has strict rules on the use of eminent domain for economic development, which limits the city’s power to assemble a complex urban site for the team—unless it’s on city-owned land. But trading City Hall for an arena would be short-sighted, overestimating the power of stadiums as engines of regeneration and underestimating the value of a public asset.

Many stadium-led developments disappoint, and students of those deals say that people who point to sports as the source of revitalization in San Diego or Baltimore, for example, mistake correlation for causation. Stadiums usually require huge amounts of public subsidy, in land or tax breaks. They tend to be islands of activity whose spillover effects end at the parking garage (casinos are even worse). They are good for some businesses (bars) but not so much for others (grocery stores, doctor’s offices). They cannibalize jobs and spending that might have occurred elsewhere in the city, and hang the prior stadium and associated neighborhood out to dry—in the Mavs’ case, the 25-year-old American Airlines Center, which is a mile away.

Stadium megadevelopments that entice the public’s contribution with the promise of neighborhood renewal are under way in cities such as Nashville and Washington, D.C., but there is always a risk that economic conditions change and reality falls short of the plans. Such a scenario wouldn’t be the first time a failure to launch led to another parking lot in Downtown Dallas: City Hall itself was designed to permit an extension in the back; now the site is parking.

The push to abandon City Hall is even more reckless. Tearing down the building would trade today’s cost of repair for the cost of demolition, and tomorrow’s maintenance for rent. It would forfeit a purpose-built structure with grounds for public protest, city-council chambers, soaring interior spaces, and a municipal garage for a few vacant floors of office space that no one else wants. It would sacrifice a symbol of the city at a time when downtown’s sense of identity is wavering, to add one more empty lot to a neighborhood that is full of them. It would destroy an irreplaceable piece of America’s cultural heritage to facilitate a real-estate project that could, by the Mavericks’ own admission, just as soon be plopped down by the side of a highway.

For decades, a fatal assumption of American downtowns has been that, to compete, they must offer their best approximation of the big, blank parcels and ample parking of their suburban rivals. It’s an impossible game to win. Dallas might instead try to be different. It’s not hard to imagine a stadium district that enfolds City Hall, embracing the contrast and the uniqueness of the historic building in its midst. The jumble, juxtaposition, and surprise of parcel-by-parcel development can distinguish a downtown even when it has lost its claim as the economic center.

This is already happening in Dallas, where the residential population downtown has increased from a few hundred to more than 15,000 over the past two decades, in part thanks to piecemeal conversions of obsolete office buildings. A trio of Dallas architects has made the case that City Hall and the arena could have a symbiotic relationship in a renewed, resident-anchored downtown that would benefit from being busy at all times of day.

That means planning for something other than drivers from elsewhere, with safer and slower streets, local businesses, and redevelopment incentives for vacant lots. That kind of organic growth is what sets a city up to resist the lure of the suburbs and lowers the stakes of negotiations with giants such as AT&T and the Mavs. Nothing is terribly exciting about investing in shade trees or crosswalks, but at least a crosswalk never traded Luka Dončić.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To live in time is to wonder what will happen next. In every human society, there are people who obsess over the world’s patterns to predict the future. In antiquity, they told kings which stars would appear at nightfall. Today they build the quantitative models that nudge governments into opening spigots of capital. They pick winners on Wall Street. They estimate the likelihood of earthquakes for insurance companies. They tell commodities traders at hedge funds about the next month’s weather.

For years, some elite forecasters have been competing against one another in tournaments where they answer questions about events that will happen—or not—in the coming months or years. The questions span diverse subject matter because they’re meant to measure general forecasting ability, not narrow expertise. Players may be asked whether a coup will occur in an unstable country, or to project the future deforestation rate in some part of the Amazon. They may be asked how many songs from a forthcoming Taylor Swift album will top the streaming charts. The forecaster who makes the most accurate predictions, as early as possible, can earn a cash prize and, perhaps more important, the esteem of the world’s most talented seers.

These tournaments have become much more popular during the recent boom of prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, where hundreds of thousands of people around the world now trade billions of dollars a month on similar sorts of forecasting questions. And now AIs are playing in them, too. At first, the bots didn’t fare too well: At the end of 2024, no AI had even managed to place 100th in one of the major competitions. But they have since vaulted up the leaderboards. AIs have already proved that they can make superhuman predictions within the bounded context of a board game, but they may soon be better than us at divining the future of our entire messy, contingent world.

Three times a year, the forecasting platform Metaculus hosts a tournament that is known to have especially difficult questions. It generally attracts the more serious forecasters, Ben Shindel, a materials scientist who ranked third among participants in a recent competition, told me. Last year, at its Summer Cup, a London-based start-up called Mantic entered an AI prediction engine. Like other participants, the Mantic AI had to answer 60 questions by assigning probabilities to certain outcomes. The AI had to guess how the battle lines in Ukraine would shift. It had to pick the winner of the Tour de France and estimate Superman’s global box-office gross during its opening weekend. It had to say whether China would ban the export of a rare earth element, and predict whether a major hurricane would strike the Atlantic coast before September. It had to figure out whether Elon Musk and Donald Trump would disparage each other, in public, within a certain range of dates.

A few months later, the guesses from Mantic’s prediction engine and the other tournament participants were scored against the real-life outcomes and one another. The AI placed eighth out of more than 500 entrants, a new record for a bot. “It was an unexpected breakthrough” according to Toby Shevlane, Mantic’s CEO. Shevlane told me that he left a cushy gig as a research scientist at Google DeepMind to co-found the company. He wanted to celebrate the AI’s triumph, but he worried that it had been the product of some lucky guesses. He and his team entered a new version of it into the Metaculus Fall Cup. That bot did even better. Not only did it finish fourth, another record, it beat a weighted average of all human-forecaster predictions. It proved itself wiser than the wisdom of a pretty wise crowd.

Mantic’s AI engine is designed to make accurate forecasts in just about any domain. Shevlane wouldn’t show me the engine’s interface, and he was cagey about its precise construction. He described it only as a “scaffolding” that comprises several large language models with different inclinations. These individual LLMs are themselves getting much better at general forecasts, especially those made by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. That’s partly because good forecasting requires reading and processing enormous amounts of information. To guess the winner of the Tour de France, for example, a human forecaster might spend hours building a basic regression model based on previous years’ results, while also scouring injury and conditioning reports and reading commentary from fans and experts. AIs have a natural advantage here. They can read much faster than humans, and their cognitive skills don’t break down after a string of all-nighters.

Last year, a team advised by Haifeng Xu, a professor at the University of Chicago, built a benchmarking service that evaluates AI’s predictions on a continuing basis. Almost every day, it asks the major models new questions pulled from the betting markets on Kalshi. (It recently asked them who Apple’s next CEO would be and also who would star in the upcoming season of The White Lotus.) Their accuracy scores continually update as the questions resolve. “They all have different forecasting personalities,” Xu told me. The version of ChatGPT that the service evaluates is conservative, perhaps too conservative; on Xu’s leaderboard, it currently trails versions of Grok and Gemini.

Mantic’s prediction engine combines a bunch of LLMs and assigns each one different tasks. One might serve as an expert on a database of election results. Another might be asked to scan weather data, economic outcomes, or box-office receipts, depending on the question that it’s attacking. The models work together as a team to generate a final prediction. Shevlane told me that Mantic is using its computing resources to experiment with more complex scaffoldings, which make use of even more models. I asked him whether they have sought AI’s input on the general structure of these scaffoldings. Not yet, he said, but like almost everyone else, they are using it to help write the code for their prediction engines.

A company called Lightning Rod Labs has been experimenting with predictive models that are purpose-built for specific domains. They have even designed one to predict Trump’s erratic behavior. Ben Turtel, the company’s CEO, told me that his team presented to the model a set of more than 2,000 forecasting questions with known outcomes that were not included in its training data. Then the model checked its answers against the things that Trump had actually done, and learned from its mistakes. When the company had the small model forecast Trump’s behavior on a new set of questions—whether he would meet with Xi Jinping in person, for example, or attend the Army-Navy football game—it outperformed OpenAI’s most advanced models.

This year could be big for AI prediction. In January, Mantic entered its most recent souped-up engine into the Metaculus Spring Cup for 2026. It has already been asked how many Oscars Sinners will win and if the United States will soon attack Iran. By May, these questions will resolve, and we will see how the engine fared. If it moves up one spot from its most recent finish, it will become the first AI to medal in a major prediction tournament.

If the AI takes gold, that might signal a new era. Human beings—predictors of eclipses, theorists of cosmic heat death—may no longer be the best guides to the future. From this point on, for as long as we exist, we might be asking AIs what comes next. We won’t always understand how they arrived at their predictions. This crystal ball may be like a black hole with an event horizon, past which the light of its insight cannot escape. We may just have to take it at its word.

So far, elite human forecasters have been pretty good sports about this possibility. When I spoke with Shindel, the highly ranked forecaster, he had nothing but admiring things to say about the AIs. “Their reasoning capabilities are very good,” he told me. “They don’t have the same biases that people have. They can find out about news right as it happens, and they don’t become attached to their predictions.” On Metaculus, a group of forecasters has taken to estimating when AIs will have the chops to out-predict an elite team of humans. Last January, they said there was about a 75 percent chance this would happen by 2030. Now they think it’s more like 95 percent.</div>

            <h2>What Mamdani Doesn’t Know About Tenants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/mamdani-tenant-organizing-affordable-housing/685951/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On New Year’s Day, Zohran Mamdani completed his inauguration festivities and departed for Brooklyn. In the working-class neighborhood of East Flatbush, the new mayor stepped into the lobby of an old apartment building on Clarkson Avenue and met with tenants on rent strike. Their grievances were many: The building has 201 outstanding housing-code violations, including leaks, roach infestations, black mold, and that most perilous of winter derelictions, a lack of consistent heat and hot water.

The young democratic-socialist mayor had championed working-class tenants throughout his campaign, promising to freeze rents in rent-stabilized apartments for four years and even to seize control of buildings owned by slumlords. This trip could be seen as a down payment on his intent.

Mamdani faced reporters and photographers in the lobby. “Landlords have been allowed to mistreat their tenants with impunity,” he declared. “That ends today.” Cea Weaver, the new director of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and, like Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, stood at his side. Her disdain for private-market landlords is no less fierce than Mamdani’s; she has argued that no tenant should be evicted for not paying rent. A few days later, the mayor would announce “rental ripoff hearings” at which tenants could excoriate bad landlords. (A social-media promotion reads like a movie poster: “Mayor Mamdani & the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants Present New Yorkers vs Bad Landlords.”)

Michael Powell: The question-mark mayoralty

As it happens, in the early 1980s, I worked as a tenant organizer in the same neighborhood, including at a building a few doors down from the one where Mamdani spoke. I empathize with the mayor’s fury and recall my own outrage as I spoke with hardworking tenants who ran their ovens with the doors open to stay warm and watched mice scamper across their floors. We confronted bad landlords and ventured into the chaos of housing court in search of justice that often proved elusive.

But over time the problems we were trying to address, and the solutions, began to look more complicated. Rage, I learned, was not enough. In my three years as an organizer, I received a bracing education in the economics of rent-stabilized apartments, the terrible cost that crime wreaks on struggling neighborhoods, and the delicate ecology of low-income housing. All of which shapes my view of Mamdani’s promises: Rent freezes and promises for the city to take over neglected apartment buildings make for good, visceral politics but poor public policy.

I was born and raised in New York City, and grew up in a rent-controlled apartment. My family’s sometimes-straitened finances meant that we would remain renters. I became a tenant organizer in my early 20s, working for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, an offshoot of the city’s Commission on Human Rights. My plan was to change the world, or at least my corner of it.

New York at the time was far more desolate and dilapidated than the expensive, albeit deeply unequal, financial capital it is today. In East Flatbush in the early 1980s, I found blocks of attached brick homes and boulevards with once-grand apartment buildings. But Church Avenue, the commercial spine of the neighborhood, offered a dreary run of boarded-up storefronts, interrupted here and there by diners, real-estate offices, discount shops, and bodegas, where you could score a nickel bag of weed along with your quart of milk. Farther east lay blocks with burnt-out apartment buildings, ghostly at night, and lots strewn with bricks and old bathtubs, mattresses, and cribs. To reach one tenant association I worked with, I had to navigate an open-air heroin market. (I was safe enough; dealers assumed I was just another white boy in need of a fix.)

One night, as I hustled along a deserted avenue to the bus, I passed a row of commercial garages and felt momentarily hopeful: Thank God these businesses remain. Then I heard the high-pitched whine of electric saws behind metal gates, and I realized these were chop shops, where men worked through the night to reduce stolen cars to marketable parts.

The city at that point had shed jobs and residents by the hundreds of thousands. Many white residents in East Flatbush had succumbed to racist fearmongering by real-estate speculators and sold their home for a fraction of the assessed value; the speculators sold those homes to Black buyers at exorbitant interest rates. As new arrivals tried to find their footing, a tide of homicides and drug dealing swept in. In 1976, an influential former local official wrote an essay in The New York Times advising that the city should withdraw services from degraded neighborhoods, even razing apartment blocks, closing subway stations, and leaving land to “lie fallow”; he called it “planned shrinkage.” That did not happen, not exactly, but the neglect was real. The working-class West Indians, Haitians, and African Americans who poured into East Flatbush differed not so much economically from earlier white residents, but they had to fight mightily to obtain the most basic services.

Most tenants I worked with in East Flatbush hailed from the West Indies, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Grenada, and nearly all of them lived in rent-stabilized apartments. One building in particular comes to mind, on Cortelyou Road. The tenants lived in a 1920s-era four-floor walk-up with 25 rent-stabilized units. (Under New York’s rent-stabilization laws, an appointed board sets maximum allowable rent increases citywide.) The landlord, a Jamaican-born insurance salesman, was not a bad guy; at best, he was a couple of steps up the income ladder from his struggling tenants. He had sunk his life savings into the building in hopes of turning a profit, and that was proving a very bad bet.

The old boiler wheezed and stalled, the roof sprang leaks, half-century-old pipes cracked, and the lobby intercom was defunct. The building needed intensive care. But the rent roll was puny, and few tenants could have paid more even if rent stabilization had allowed for it. One evening, the landlord told us that he could not afford to run the building.

Tenant leaders were sympathetic, but this was about survival. They persuaded a housing-court judge to push the landlord aside and appoint an administrator who was empowered to spend rent monies only on heat and emergency repairs. Tougher decisions followed. A young mother of two was well liked but fell months behind on rent; when the city welfare department gave her an emergency cash grant, she declined to use it to pay the rent. A mother of three was romantically entangled with a man who had commandeered a third-floor landing for his drug business and whose clientele sometimes broke into apartments. The tenant association voted to move to evict these women, their decision no less necessary for being sad.

The landlord walked away without a penny. There were no proletarian hearings to denounce a slumlord, who in this case did not really exist. Just deeply painful decisions. But the tenants managed to assure that the building would remain what it is to this day: rent stabilized, still of somewhat-precarious finances. I remember asking a tenant leader what she had prayed for during those tough times. “A good super who understands boilers,” she replied.

East Flatbush is a much healthier place today. New, handsome apartment buildings have gone up, and you can see signs of that mixed blessing known as gentrification. Church Avenue is revived, nearly every storefront occupied, jazz clubs mixing with Haitian bistros, home-loan shops, day-care centers, and Jamaican fish shacks. But the neighborhood still feels fragile, acutely sensitive to any uptick in crime and any drop-off in city services.

The multifamily-housing stock in East Flatbush remains particularly vulnerable, as it does in all but the wealthiest of the city’s neighborhoods. (New York has 1 million rent-stabilized apartments.) Today, even many well-run rent-stabilized buildings are still only marginally profitable. That is in part because of rent-law changes pushed through the state legislature in 2019, and advocated by Weaver. These changes include laudable protections for tenants, but the economic effects are more uncertain. Previously, when a tenant moved out of a stabilized apartment, the landlord could raise the rent by 20 percent. Landlords were also allowed to substantially increase rents if they rehabilitated an apartment or made major improvements to a building. Under the new law, they can raise rents by only minuscule amounts to cover rehabilitation costs. One need not weep for landlords—some of whom have prospered mightily—to note they no longer have much incentive to fix up apartments.

Rogé Karma: Mamdani has a point about rent control

Meanwhile, operating costs are rising faster than rental revenues, according to the NYU Furman Center, which recently examined rent-stabilized housing. And rent collections in many working-class buildings in New York never fully rebounded after COVID. The result, predictably, is disinvestment: As managers have cut back on maintenance, the number of code violations has spiked—a 47 percent increase in the past five years in the rent-stabilized buildings that NYU examined. A study by Enterprise Community Partners, an organization that supports affordable housing, found that costs for affordable-housing operators—including insurance, maintenance, and administrative expenses—jumped 40 percent from 2017 to 2024; six of every 10 projects the group has financed are losing money. All of this is risky business for those who operate buildings that are 80 to 100 years old. These problems extend as well to rent-stabilized buildings run by respected nonprofits.

Even the Mamdani administration has acknowledged the near-impossible economics of rent-stabilized housing. After the mayor visited the building on Clarkson Avenue, the city’s law department sued to delay the sale of the building and 92 others owned by the same landlord in a bankruptcy auction; the landlord, the Pinnacle Group, owed the city $12.7 million in arrears and fines. The city wanted to sideline the leading bidder, and was trying to buy time, likely so it could steer the portfolio to a more tenant-friendly buyer, or even the city itself.

I have no quibble with targeting the Pinnacle Group, which is in bankruptcy proceedings on 93 buildings with 5,150 apartments, most of which are rent stabilized; these buildings have a cumulative 5,000 code violations and 14,000 complaints. But in court documents, the city’s lawyers pointed out that rents in Pinnacle’s portfolio are “very low averaging” and that those revenues are too low to constitute a “supportable business.” That is surely an obstacle to clearing up code violations. A federal bankruptcy judge denied the city’s motion, ruling that the new proposed buyer had submitted a “reasonable-sounding plan” to manage the buildings—potentially saving the city from a very expensive rehabilitation project.

All of this underlines why fixing the problem of affordable housing in New York City is not so simple as freezing rents. Mamdani’s deputy mayor for housing and planning recently said that the administration wants to lower costs for landlords—for example, through property-tax reform, tax breaks for renovating apartments, and attempts to slow the steep rise in building-insurance costs. The mayor’s primary focus, however, is on what tenants pay to live in this terrifically expensive city and the quality of their housing. That’s far from irrelevant. But the question of how to get landlords to deliver this housing without bankrupting their buildings matters just as much.

There was also, for me as an organizer, the issue of crime. Five years ago, Mamdani argued that the New York Police Department was essentially evil and should have its budget deeply slashed. He has softened that view considerably since taking office, but many DSA comrades still hold it. I can speak only to my own experience: Nothing so erodes the stability of neighborhoods and buildings as failing to address crime.

I felt its pernicious effects personally in East Flatbush. Tenants had formed an association at a building on Martense Street, at a then-sketchy corner. The building had many ailments, and the landlord seemed intent on doing as little as possible about them. Tenants identified their greatest need as a working intercom. Absent that, the front door swung ajar, a welcome sign to thieves. One afternoon, I walked downstairs after talking with the tenant leaders and found five adolescent boys jiggering locks to break into an apartment.

Yo, yo, yo, get out of here, I said loudly, waving my hands to scat.

The littlest boy pulled out a strikingly large gun and stuck it in my face. Shoot him, two boys yelled. Nah, leave the motherfucker alone, the other two said. The boy considered his options, then tucked the gun back into his waistband. He told me I was lucky to be alive. I nodded in agreement.

Henry Grabar: The great crime decline is happening all across the country

Such episodes threatened civic life in a most elemental fashion. A homeowner block leader who risked catching a stray bullet was far less likely to walk to an evening meeting at a local church. Tenants told me they worried that if they talked openly in their lobby about crime, snitches for local drug dealers might overhear and report them. Other tenants sometimes insisted on walking me to the subway after a meeting, placing themselves in harm’s way.

I never once heard a tenant leader or block leader argue for less policing. They wanted a respectful partnership with law enforcement. At great risk, they monitored dangerous streets and rowhouses, took notes on dealers and gangs, and passed this information along to the local precincts and to the mayor’s office. Some cops and city officials were unresponsive, even corrupt. But the best listened carefully and used that information to clear notorious corners and round up gang leaders.

I once stood watch with tenants every night for a week after we heard that their landlord had hired an arsonist—known as a “torch”—to burn down their building, so the landlord could collect the insurance money. The city’s Arson Strike Force got involved, and the building stands to this day.

The new mayor is fond of his On the Waterfront rhetoric, and tends to suggest that, before the socialists came to power, city government was dismissive of the poor and working class. He means well, but this is nonsense. Thankfully, city officials—prodded by tenants and small-business owners, clergy and homeowners, and, yes, some landlords—rejected advice to consign neighborhoods such as East Flatbush to history’s dustbin. Beginning in the 1980s, successive mayors, Democrats and Republicans, invested first hundreds of millions and then billions of dollars in what became the greatest urban-rebuilding program in American history. The city and nonprofits rehabilitated abandoned buildings and constructed new ones, along with day cares and schools. The rubble-strewn lots I once walked through are now smart-looking apartment buildings. Banks and supermarkets sit on corners where drug dealers held sway. Citywide, many fewer children are in foster care, fewer men are in prison, and far fewer New Yorkers are murdered each year.

I took a walk recently through East Flatbush, alongside the snow-laden Holy Cross Cemetery, down Church Avenue, and along a couple of boulevards of prewar apartment buildings, as achingly beautiful and, in some cases, as tattered as when I first arrived there. The city still faces many challenges, but its recent history gives me hope that a new mayor and administration committed to improving affordable housing can make a profound mark. To do that, Mamdani will need to toss aside easy moral binaries—noble tenants versus capitalist landlords, frozen rents versus runaway profits—and recognize the painful trade-offs that will come with restoring rent-stabilized housing, one of New York’s great resources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ken Martin has one of those resting dread faces, as if he’s bracing for someone to dump a bucket of rocks on his head. His nervous eyes make him look chronically unsettled—which is probably appropriate for someone trying to run the Democratic National Committee these days.

“The political equivalent of being a fire hydrant” is how Martin describes his job, and then helpfully explains the image to anyone not grasping it: “You get pissed on by everyone.” This is a favorite line and recurring theme: the put-upon chairman, always being hassled by his easily triggered constituencies.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

The first time he said this to me, the week before Thanksgiving, the triggered included Martin’s own employees. He had been dealing with a staff revolt following his November 12 announcement that the DNC would be ending its generous work-from-home guidelines. Everyone would be expected to return to headquarters full-time, Martin told his staff, starting in February.

This did not go over well. Thumbs-down emoji filled the Zoom screen. Employees pelted Martin with questions. He told me that he sympathized, but observed that most major public- and private-sector organizations had long since compelled their employees to return to their offices.

“If it’s unbearable and it’s a quality-of-life thing for you, I’m happy to help you find another job,” Martin said he told his staff. The complaints persisted.

“Shocking” and “callous,” the DNC’s employee union said of the chairman’s directive in a statement to The New York Times.

The squabble underscored how the Democrats can’t help but keep playing to a stubborn stereotype—a soft and pampered bunch, unwilling to make the gritty sacrifices (such as getting dressed) necessary to prevail in their “existential” campaign to save democracy.

“The Democrats treat their fucking people like kindergartners,” Sarah Longwell, a former Republican consultant who quit the party over Donald Trump, told me. Longwell can get exasperated by her new allies on the left. When I mentioned the DNC’s in-person-work kerfuffle, it set her off.

“Republicans are over here being straight-up mercenaries,” Longwell said. “Democrats give everybody Fridays off and talk about work-life balance.” She apologized for yelling into the phone. Democrats “are not built for when the fascists come,” she concluded.

Martin has invited similar doubts about himself. A former head of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, he won an election in February 2025 for the privilege of leading the divided, despondent, and destitute committee. He barely survived the summer after Politico received a leaked audiotape of a May 15 meeting in which an anguished Martin can be heard describing the toll of his job to DNC officers: “The other night I said to myself for the first time, I don’t know if I want to do this anymore.”

But things were looking up. Martin and I were sipping Diet Cokes at the National Democratic Club, next to the DNC headquarters, on the south side of Capitol Hill. The place was bustling, even festive, for a late Monday afternoon. Assorted House members, Hill staffers, Democratic donors, and lobbyist types clustered around tables of drinks and hors d’oeuvres. Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin stopped by to say hello to Martin. Others waved as they passed our table, and a few congratulated him. It had been a while since he’d been congratulated for anything.

Despite Martin’s rough start in the job, the party’s spirits had brightened considerably after November 4, when Democrats scored double-digit wins in the Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races. Although both candidates—former House members Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey—had been favored to win, their impressive margins, along with other overperformances by Democrats across the country, were viewed as hopeful signs for the 2026 midterms.

A veteran party apparatchik, Martin arrived in Washington just as Trump was returning to the White House. Even more than during his first go-round, Trump has enjoyed near-unanimous complicity from supine Republican majorities in Congress, as well as meek resistance from a dazed opposition. Martin, 52, is the harried face of this meek resistance.

I had been checking in with him periodically since the summer as part of my attempt to assess how the Democrats had managed to so thoroughly marginalize themselves. No matter how eager they were to resist Trump, they kept living up to their worst image as an overly sensitive, out-of-touch, and terminally online band of myopic and overindulged factions.

Martin himself has a knack for reinforcing these caricatures. Just as I was starting this project, he presided over the DNC’s summer meeting in Minneapolis to begin the urgent work of rebuilding the Democratic coalition and making the party palatable to American voters again. Soon after calling the assembly of more than 400 party officials to order, Martin relinquished his mic to a representative of the Saginaw Ojibwe Nation for the DNC’s “land acknowledgment” ritual. Switching between English and her tribal language, the Indigenous woman affirmed that Minneapolis had been stolen from its native Dakota Oyate Tribe (“the original stewards of the lands and waters”).

The interlude took only a minute or two but received outsize attention—and ridicule—as an example of how Democrats remain overly concerned with performative pandering to various small identity groups. “It is difficult to imagine more than a handful of people looking out over the current hellscape of U.S. policy and thinking to themselves: You know what we need to be sure to address today? The Dakota War of 1862,” Andrew Egger wrote in The Bulwark.

“What is Ken Martin doing?” the Democrats’ crank emeritus, James Carville, wondered aloud on his Politics War Room podcast. It is not the DNC’s job to right the well-documented wrongs of American history, Carville said. “It doesn’t exist to make people feel good. It exists—get this through your head—to win elections.”

I asked Martin if gestures like land acknowledgments were worth the trouble. He bristled. “I’ve always felt that it’s important to be an inclusive party,” he told me. This suggested that the land acknowledgments would continue.

“We’re not going to abandon who we are,” Martin said. “People can call it ‘woke’ as much as they want.” He disputed the notion that he was focused on anything other than winning in 2026.

“It’s all gas, no brakes,” Martin insisted. And imperative that “we do the work between now and November.”

Although it seems that many people at the DNC would prefer to “do the work” from home.

The DNC’s mini-mutiny over the return-to-office mandate ruined the brief elation of the off-year victories. Candidates running for office rely on massive numbers of volunteers, Virginia’s now-Governor Spanberger told me. They work their day jobs and then offer up their spare time because they believe in the cause. So it is not a good look for paid party staff to be talking publicly “about how hard it is to go into an office to get paid to do things that campaign workers do in their volunteer time,” Spanberger said.

But perhaps the deeper issue is that Democrats have historically focused too much on keeping their many constituent groups as happy as possible, sometimes at the expense of their principal goal: triumphing in elections so they can implement their policies. “First and foremost, Democrats need to get much more ruthless about winning,” Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan told me. This, she said, is not always compatible with the “weird consensus-based leadership” that their leaders tend toward.

As Trump has rampaged Caligula-like through his second term—draping federal buildings with massive likenesses of himself and renaming them in his honor; razing an entire wing of the White House; deploying masked agents to snatch brown-skinned people from sidewalks; running roughshod over constitutional norms, NATO, Minneapolis, and Venezuela alike—rank-and-file Democrats have shown a clear preference for Team Ruthless. Unleash the alpha dogs, they keep saying—the more rabid, the better.

“They want to win so fucking bad,” said Longwell, who has convened hundreds of focus groups across the political spectrum. Democratic leaders and political strategists need to understand that anything that does not lead to winning elections is extraneous, she said. “If you watch the DNC, you still see the pronouns on the name tags and the land acknowledgment at the start, and the voters are like, Get that stuff out of here.”

My assignment was to pick through the Democrats’ post-2024 debris. I wanted to see if this once-confident multiracial coalition of working-class men and women could somehow get itself together in time for the midterms. Could the Democrats make themselves a viable alternative to the bumbling but dangerous autocrats on the other side? Are they capable of regaining some measure of power, despite themselves?

I traveled around the country and interviewed about four dozen Democratic candidates, elected officials, party leaders, operatives, and voters I met at rallies, town halls, and other gatherings. What I encountered was a political party on a search: for a winning message; for a fresh identity; for new leaders; for the elusive white knight, whatever that might look like. In the past, saviors have occasionally materialized, but rarely how a broken party imagined them. No one saw Barack Obama coming, sweeping in to define a winning coalition of Democrats in 2008. Nor, for that matter, did anyone envisage Donald Trump doing the same for Republicans eight years later. Fortunes can turn fast.

But Democrats have remained stuck in their funk for an unusually long stretch. For much of 2025, their doldrums felt much worse than the typical rough patch that parties endure after bad election defeats. They were staggered, self-pitying, and seemingly traumatized by the denouement of the Joe Biden years. They have wallowed and feuded.

They have also analyzed themselves to death. If sheer tonnage of voter case studies and white papers could rescue a party, Democrats would be set for years. My inbox overflowed with the latest theories on how Democrats had lost their way and what was needed to revive them. Dueling autopsies were produced by various advocacy groups.

“How Democrats Lost the White House,” from RootsAction, blamed party leaders. “The Working Class Project,” from American Bridge 21st Century, determined that the party’s traditional coalition of blue-collar voters has come to “perceive Democrats to be woke, weak, and out-of-touch, too focused on social issues.” “Deciding to Win,” a data-based dissection published by WelcomePAC, argued that as Democrats have moved left on issues such as crime and immigration, self-identified moderates and conservatives have abandoned the party. For good measure, the centrist group Third Way produced “Was It Something I Said?,” a guide to help Democrats avoid speaking “like the extreme, divisive, elitist, and obfuscatory enforcers of wokeness.” It included a handy compendium of 45 words and phrases (dialoguing, microaggression, stakeholders, LGBTQIA+) that the party should not use, because they create “a wall between us and everyday people.”

From the April 2023 issue: George Packer on how banning words won’t make the world more just

Of all the autopsy porn I luxuriated in, the most compelling was “How the Democrats Lost America: Making Sense of the 2024 Election and the Future of American Politics,” by Scott Ferson, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist. The exhaustive report—which will be published as a book in April—is based on more than 1,000 interviews that Ferson and his team conducted during the Trump and Biden years.

Ferson argues that in recent decades the Democratic Party has developed an “elitist problem” that has caused it to lose its connection to many Americans. The migration of low-income, non-college-educated voters to the GOP has accelerated: Scores of Black and Latino Americans joined Trump’s coalition in 2024. Recent research suggests a significant shift in how voters perceive the parties; more people now believe that Republicans best represent the interests of the poor and working class, while Democrats are coming to be viewed as the party of rich elites. (Ken Martin has called this reversal “a damning indictment” of the Democrats “that’s got to change.”) Recent presidential-election trends illustrate this turnabout. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried voters earning more than $100,000 a year by 10 percentage points; in 2024, Kamala Harris won them by four points. In 2012, Obama won voters making less than $50,000 a year by 22 points; in 2024, Trump won those voters by two points.

In his report, Ferson describes conversations he had with people in the districts in and around Canton, Ohio, which have been decimated by plant closures and job losses. “I think the Democrats’ message to people in Canton, Ohio, is You should move,” Ferson told me, adding that many Canton residents think Democrats feel superior to them and their hometown. His research also confirmed how effective conservative media have been in reducing Democrats to caricatures. “By the time we knock on their door in Pennsylvania,” Ferson said, quoting a line from the Democratic media consultant Joe Trippi, “we’re a pedophile space alien who created AI to take their job away.”

Shortly after Martin became chair, he announced that the DNC would be producing its own report on the lessons of 2024. He purposely called it an “after-action review” and not an autopsy, to emphasize that the party is “not dead.” That was reassuring.

Whatever they’re called, the various post-2024 analyses all posed the same unavoidable questions: How had the party lost the working-class voters who were once the backbone of its coalition? Would Democrats be better served by running more moderate candidates to court persuadable swing voters? Or by running more firebrand, populist types, who are better at creating excitement?

The off-year results of 2025 offered something for everyone. “Your task is going to be not to impose litmus tests,” Obama told a room of giddy Democrats during a live Pod Save America podcast a couple of days after the victories. “We had Abigail Spanberger win, and we had Zohran Mamdani win, and they are all part of a vision for the future.” But Spanberger and Mamdani, who won the New York City mayor’s race, were well situated culturally and ideologically for the very different electorates they were running in. It is hard to imagine the Democratic Socialist Mamdani winning a statewide race in Virginia.

In October, Democrats nominated Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative and former progressive activist, in a special election for a U.S. House seat in a heavily Republican district in the Nashville area. Behn, who once described herself as a “radical” and campaigned with the very progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, was portrayed by her opponent as extreme. She wound up losing by nearly nine points to the Republican Matt Van Epps. Though Democrats celebrated this as another overperformance (Trump had carried the district by 22 points in 2024), a more moderate candidate, one not nicknamed “AOC of Tennessee,” likely would have done better. “The problem is that the left just is unalterably dedicated to this proposition that if you are more radical, you will turn out more voters,” Matt Bennett, of Third Way, told Politico. “And it keeps being disproven over and over and over.”

But parties are stuck with whomever their voters decide to nominate. “We have to stop acting like we’re casting parts in a play,” Spanberger told me. “Like, Oh, this person should run in Virginia, or this person feels like a good Texas Democrat.” Candidates are going to run regardless of whether some political operative or professional opinion-haver thinks they’re sabotaging the party’s chances. And primary voters tend to vote for the candidate they personally prefer, regardless of whether that candidate has the best chance of winning a general election.

Consider the scenario playing out in Texas, where Representative Jasmine Crockett, an unrestrained liberal media magnet, is running for the Senate seat held by the Republican John Cornyn. Crockett’s gift for profane insult comedy aimed at Republicans has made her a celebrated sound-bite warrior on the left. But it is not clear that she would have a better chance of winning in red Texas than State Representative James Talarico, a 36-year-old former seminarian and aspiring minister, whose viral speeches have raised his profile, as well as a stunning amount of cash. Talarico’s faith and his relative political moderation could make him more palatable to Texans than Crockett in a general election. In January, an Emerson College poll had Talarico performing slightly better against Cornyn than Crockett in a general-election matchup.

But what if the main divide among Democrats today is not, as so many assume, progressive versus moderate? Slotkin told me that “Is it Mamdani or is it Spanberger? ” is “kind of an outdated approach.” The more consequential split, she said, is between leaders willing “to fight and go on offense” and those content to wait Trump out.

Since Trump’s reelection, Democratic voters have shown a strong preference for the former. They’ve also made it clear that they think their current leaders have been soft and timid. Seventy-one percent of Democrats and 78 percent of all Americans believe that the party has been ineffective in standing up to Trump, according to a June CBS News/YouGov survey. And 62 percent of Democrats say the party needs new leadership, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found, also in June.

If Democratic voters perceive a candidate to be principled and unrelenting, they have been more than willing to look beyond acres of red flags. Graham Platner, a gravelly voiced oyster farmer who is running for Senate in Maine to supplant the Republican forever-incumbent, Susan Collins, offers a case in point: Platner, a political neophyte at 41, spent much of his adult life in the combat thickets of Iraq and Afghanistan before pivoting to mollusks. His campaign started off like gangbusters in August, attracting huge crowds and millions in donations. Reporters flowed to Sullivan, Maine, for an audience with the burly oysterman (just as soon as they were done with the Jesus-loving Democrat in Texas).

“My plan is to just bribe reporters with oysters,” Platner told me as he shucked a few fleshy ones from a cage he’d pulled in. It was a windy morning in early September, and we were out on the white-capped waters of Sullivan Harbor, near Acadia National Park. “Working-class populist” is how Platner described himself. “I’m a small-business owner. And I also own an immense amount of firearms.”

If this was a casting call, Platner nailed it: flannel shirts, weathered caps, a pro wrestler’s voice. “I’m a fucking oyster farmer from Sullivan, for God’s sake,” he told me at one point, which might as well go on a bumper sticker.

Platner seemed a far more compelling character than Maine’s 78-year-old governor, Janet Mills, the candidate preferred by the party establishment. To his excited supporters, Platner might just be the Democrats’ perfect populist insurgent for Maine.

Well, maybe not perfect. Okay, not at all perfect.

Like shellfish, political newcomers only stay fresh for so long before they start to smell. Old Reddit posts can surface. Such as the one where the candidate remarked that some white rural Americans were stupid and racist. Or the ones that were homophobic or misogynistic. Or the anti-police one. Platner, who called his Reddit comments “indefensible,” attributed the “dark feelings” reflected in them to his time in the infantry. Chairman Martin called the old posts “hurtful” but not “disqualifying.”

Next came a swell of questions about the large tattoo that Platner had on his chest, a skull and crossbones widely recognized to be a Nazi death’s-head. He claimed that he had been ignorant of the insignia’s Third Reich associations, and that he had gotten the ink done in Croatia following a drunken night out with his Marine pals in 2007. When the tattoo became a campaign issue, he hastily got it covered over.

It would be nice if Democrats could find a working-class-hero candidate who was not sullied by, say, a Nazi tattoo. But Platner’s early support has proved durable. His supporters blame the surfacing of his old comments on a smear campaign engineered by the establishment and the party’s rich patrons, who are scared of an unfiltered populist outsider who owes them nothing.

“I think he’s running a really good campaign,” Senator Bernie Sanders told me. “It saddens me very much that instead of engaging in a real debate about the future of America, we have some people in the Democratic leadership trying to destroy him.” Sanders said he believes that Platner “stands an excellent chance to be the next senator from Maine.”

As he navigated the choppy waters in his boat, Platner splashed from topic to topic. He talked about the finer points of oyster farming, his love of soccer and of Maine’s native osprey, how therapy had saved him after his return from combat, and various other things.

“I do love gays,” he said at one point. (Good to know!) “Somebody asked me where do I stand on LGBTQIA+,” Platner added.

Platner said that in an earlier speech, he’d just said “LGBTQ.” After thinking for a moment, he posited that the Q, I, and A stand for “queer, intersex, and androgynous.”

Platner’s broader argument is that although his campaign is focused on the “material conditions that people are living in”—hospital closures, housing shortages, affordability—he is not willing to compromise on social issues at the expense of vulnerable populations. “I don’t think there is any value, both morally but also politically, in selling people out,” Platner said.

His aide interjected with a correction: In fact, the A in LGBTQIA+ stands for “asexual,” not “androgynous.” The candidate regretted the error.

“It’s asexual, sorry,” Platner said. “It’s asexual.”

Though the Democrats may have been buoyed by November’s elections, it is hard to overstate how far the party had fallen.

At the start of August, the DNC had $13.9 million cash on hand, compared with $84.3 million for the Republican National Committee. A New York Times analysis found that from 2020 to 2024, Democrats lagged Republicans in new-voter registrations in all 30 states that track registrations by party. Polls kept drawing a bleak picture of the party’s popularity. Over the summer, Gallup measured the party’s approval rating at 34 percent, its lowest point since Gallup began tracking partisan approval ratings, in 1992; a Wall Street Journal poll had the Democrats at 33 percent approval; a CNN poll put their approval rating at a wretched 28 percent.

Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who co-leads the Democrats’ candidate-recruiting efforts for the House, told me Democrats need to project confidence in their policy positions: “People respond to confidence, and they respond to strength.” But because Trump and the Republicans have been so effective in slapping extreme liberal caricatures on their opponents, Democrats are gun-shy. “We can’t be apologetic for our own positions, and second-guessing ourselves, and being weak and timid about it,” Crow said.

“I’ve never seen the party so unsure of itself, and so kind of lacking its own footing,” Colin Allred, the former NFL player and representative from Texas who lost the 2024 Senate race to Ted Cruz, told me. Allred, who is running for a Dallas-area House seat, described the state of the Democratic Party’s brand as “terrible.”

“We are living through hell right now, let’s be honest,” Mallory McMorrow, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Michigan, told me. But McMorrow, a 39-year-old state senator and former bartender, sounded oddly buoyant, perhaps because she sees the 2026 midterm campaigns as a chance to clear out the old bones of the party establishment. The party “has not been prepared for this moment,” McMorrow said. “It is inexcusable to go on national television and say things like ‘Well, Democrats aren’t in charge right now, so we can’t do anything.’ Why would anybody vote for you?”

And yet, despite the Democrats’ abysmal approval ratings—and their repeated, self-parodying demonstrations of why they might deserve them—voters have shown a consistent preference for them in recent months. Since Trump took office, Democrats have flipped 25 state legislative seats that had been held by Republicans, while Republicans have flipped zero seats held by Democrats. For all their dysfunction and malaise, Democrats have this key dynamic going for them: The party in power tends to overreach, mess up, and then take most of the blame when voters get cranky. This is a far more reliable blueprint for a party’s resurrection than anything drawn up at a think tank.

True to form, voters have overwhelmingly blamed Republicans for what they see as a gloomy state of national affairs. Americans broadly disapprove of how Trump has handled the economy, immigration, and the cost of living—the three issues most responsible for putting him back in the White House. The Republican policy agenda has proved disastrously unpopular: A November Gallup poll put Trump’s approval rating at 36 percent, a low for his second term, and at just 25 percent among independents.

But none of this should be confused with a national wave of love for the opposition party. On the contrary, Democrats in Congress scored a particularly dismal 18 percent approval rating in a Quinnipiac University poll released in mid-December, a record low.

Yet the DNC apparently prefers to tune this out. The day after the Quinnipiac poll was published, Martin announced that the committee’s deep-dive review of the 2024 debacle would not be released after all. In other words, while the Democratic brand continued to flatline, the autopsy itself was declared dead in the cradle—this despite DNC officials having conducted more than 300 interviews and Martin having previously called the autopsy a crucial exercise.

I’d spoken with several Democratic politicians and operatives who hoped that the memorandum, which would benefit from the DNC’s resources and access to party officials, could be an important addition to the canon of wonkery. It could help determine, for instance, which candidate profiles would work best in certain districts and states, how much blame Joe Biden deserved for 2024, and what, if anything, Kamala Harris could have done differently. But what the DNC essentially declared at the end of 2025 was Never mind. Releasing the DNC report, Martin suggests, would distract from the party’s work. Martin also seemed intent on cramming as many buzz phrases (and banned words) as possible into his official statement about the decision to scuttle the project: “In our conversations with stakeholders from across the Democratic ecosystem, we are aligned on what’s important, and that’s learning from the past and winning the future.” He continued, “Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”

Here is Martin’s north star, based on his first year at the DNC: proceed with extreme caution and commit no microaggressions.

Martin’s decision to bury the DNC’s findings invited suspicion and derision. Simon Bazelon, the lead author on the “Deciding to Win” project, told The New York Times that the aborted autopsy is sadly consistent with the Democratic leadership’s general penchant for complacency, risk aversion, and avoidance.

“It’s reflective of a broader problem within the party,” Bazelon said. “We are scared of ever making anybody in our coalition upset.”

Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona was on the phone, and I was telling him what I kept hearing about his party. Gallego, a former Marine and an Iraq War veteran, did not disagree. This was no surprise, because he has cultivated a reputation for bluntness, and the media have held him up as the Democrats’ ambassador to the regular-bro types who supported Trump by large margins.

During his winning Senate campaign in 2024, Gallego held events in boxing gyms and touted the appeal of a “big-ass truck” (apparently his attempt to buck the perception that Democrats drive only puny-ass Priuses and Jettas). Gallego is confident that none of the pejoratives affixed to Democrats—weak, feckless, timid—applies to him.

“I just called the president an idiot on national TV, so I’m not exactly the person to talk about it,” he told me.

Gallego, who is 46, prevailed in his Senate race despite a rough performance by Democrats nationally. Latino men supported him by 30 points, despite Trump carrying about half that group across the country. Everyone was asking who the Trump-Gallego voters in Arizona were, Gallego said. “A lot of them were just men who said, ‘Ruben Gallego is a fighter.’ ”

I intentionally used that word because I’d heard so many others use it to describe Democrats, typically while conveying how impotent their elected leaders have been in standing up to Trump’s serial abuses. “Yes, exactly, I totally agree,” Gallego said. But he was hesitant to be quoted using that word specifically, and he asked to go off the record.

Back on the record, Gallego told me he’d won in Arizona because those Trump-Gallego voters said, “Ruben is not a wussy like these other Democrats.” One could see why a politician would not want to utter pussy on the record, given its crass anatomical connotation (Gallego wussed out). These are sensitive times, after all, even for big-ass-truck-loving fight-fans.

Being a Democrat can be exhausting sometimes. So many considerations, so many shifting sensitivities and cancelable offenses.

Trump’s steamrolling of anything, including the Constitution, that might impede his authoritarian project has made the limpness of the Democratic opposition more conspicuous.

“What we’ve allowed to become normalized is completely deviant,” California Governor Gavin Newsom told me in the fall. “This is code red.” Newsom said that although he longs for the “When they go low, we go high shit,” this is no time for the usual political bromides and tactics. Democrats need to go beyond writing a concerned “op-ed that lands in The New York Times,” he added, which “we can retweet—to the 12 of us—and say how proud we are about our prose.”

Newsom said the Democrats need to get out of their own heads and enclaves and start acting with a desperation commensurate with the moment. If the Democratic Party remains weak, “we will get rolled,” Newsom said. “Weakness is the toxicity of our brand.”

Among nationally known Democrats, it is Newsom’s political standing that may have risen the most amid the dark Trumpian doings of 2025. The governor’s willingness to mock the president through aggressive social-media parody elevated him to de facto resistance leader. Given voter impatience with wimpy party leaders, a righteous showdown with Trump is not a bad situation for an ambitious Democrat to be in. Newsom was also willing, at great risk to himself politically, to counter GOP efforts to gerrymander red-state House districts. He blew up California’s nonpartisan redistricting laws and led a successful ballot initiative to redraw the state congressional map to favor the Democrats.

As I spoke with Newsom, I realized that pretty much everything he said was some variation of “Desperate times call for desperate measures.” Conversations with him on this topic tend to be a bacchanal of profanity and exasperation. “Wake the fuck up; wake the fuck up,” he kept saying. “This thing is being torn down.”

Newsom’s aggressive trolling of Trump has helped combat the long-standing view of him as a slick opportunist and has won him new admirers. “When people see someone fighting, they get really, really excited, and when they see someone folding, they get really, really demoralized,” Beto O’Rourke, the former representative from Texas and onetime presidential candidate, told me. “Gavin Newsom, who frankly I just wasn’t necessarily a big fan of before, I’m a big fan of right now. That guy’s a fighter.”

There’s a need for fighters, O’Rourke said, because Trump is now a “cornered animal”—one that happens to be “the most powerful animal in the country, who controls the House, the Senate, the White House, the Supreme Court, the National Guard, and has a secretary of defense who is in concert with him on using American cities as the training grounds for the military. So this is some dark stuff.”

I couldn’t help noticing that O’Rourke’s voice acquired a kind of dreamy cadence as he described the darkness. Nothing like a potential Armageddon for American democracy to get a graying former golden boy—he is now 53—excited. “It’s also this extraordinary moment,” O’Rourke continued, “where all of us who are alive today get this chance to save the country. We’re going to be tested in a way I don’t think you and I can even imagine.”

One recurring resentment among Democratic voters is the disconnect between the party’s red-alert anti-Trump rhetoric and the musty vehicles—Biden and Harris, as well as Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer, and the various other dust-gatherers—it keeps deploying to resist him. “People continue to say, ‘Oh my God, Trump is an authoritarian; the world’s going to end,’ all this stuff,” David Hogg, the 25-year-old gun-control activist and advocate for recruiting young progressive leaders, told me over the summer. Hogg, who had a brief and tumultuous stint as a DNC co–vice chair in early 2025, is contemptuous of the party’s lingering cohort of elder leaders.

“It’s like, ‘Okay, look who your members of Congress are: Some of them literally cannot stand for a press conference,’ ” he said. “You cannot credibly tell the American people that democracy is in danger and the world is ending, and the people that you are putting up on the front lines of fighting back against that genuinely belong in a nursing home.”

On that note, I headed to a Bernie Sanders rally.

“We are living in a moment that is unprecedented in the modern history of this country,” Sanders roared. The socialist senator from Vermont was speaking to a packed theater of about 3,000 people in Wheeling, West Virginia. “We have got to act in an unprecedented way in response.”

Sanders, who turned 84 in September, seems to have earned immunity from the party’s anti-gerontocratic agitators. When I saw him this past summer, he was making a stop on the Fighting Oligarchy tour, which has consistently drawn fiery hordes across the country. At times, he’s been joined by Democratic Socialists of America luminaries such as Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez. The three of them filled a stadium in Queens for a raucous rally in October, which featured chants of “Tax the rich.” Two of the Senate candidates drawing the most enthusiasm from the left—Platner in Maine and Abdul El-Sayed in Michigan—are Sanders acolytes.

These days, the far left is attracting a lot of the party’s money, media attention, and crowds. But whether this energy on the left represents the Democrats’ path to restoration or to electoral doom depends on whom you ask (or which white paper you read). A remarkable 66 percent of Democrats say they have a positive view of socialism, compared with only 42 percent for capitalism, according to an August Gallup poll.

Sanders strolled onstage in Wheeling to protracted applause and chants of “Bernie!” “I was told that West Virginia was a conservative state,” Sanders said as he hunched over a small podium. It was certainly a Trump state: The president won 70 percent of the vote there in 2024, his second-biggest margin in the country, behind Wyoming.

But West Virginia is a proletarian locale that until not long ago was a Democratic stronghold. Bill Clinton carried it twice in the ’90s; in 1988, it was one of the 10 states that Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis won in his otherwise thumping defeat at the hands of the patrician George H. W. Bush.

“We are losing working-class voters—the core of our coalition since the New Deal—to a corrupt billionaire with a gold toilet,” Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama adviser, wrote in his Message Box newsletter. A critical mass of working-class voters has deemed said gold-toilet user to be their kind of tough; they like that he professes to fight for them, and they don’t care that he fights dirty.

A lot of working-class voters prefer Trump, Graham Platner told me, because they believe he intuitively understands that they feel screwed by the world, just as Trump—the billionaire president—himself does. But running against a “rigged deal” was once the main Democratic message. Sanders had been delivering it for decades before Trump came along; the Fighting Oligarchy speeches are essentially the same ones Sanders has been giving for five decades. What’s happening in America today, Sanders declared, with several million working-class people at risk of losing their health care, is an acceleration of what has gone on for half a century: Life gets better and better for the wealthiest Americans—and worse for everyone else.

“You know what happens when people can’t go to a doctor when they need to?” Sanders asked the crowd.

Keep hope alive this is not. But the audience was on its feet and in full frenzy as Sanders revved up his rhetorical bus and set his sights on … Kamala Harris. Why had she lost?

“One of the reasons,” Sanders said, “is she had too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working class of this country.”

The line drew the loudest cheer of the evening.

A big thing for Democratic politicians these days is to swear a lot, as if by appearing pissed off and profane, they will show how raw and real they are. Since February 2025, they have sworn more often than their Republican counterparts, according to a Washington Post analysis of social-media posts and public remarks. (The big wins, they just keep piling up for the Democrats.)

One detects in this penchant for profanity a whiff of overcompensation—an effort by Democrats to prove that they can talk working-class. Ken Martin says that the party needs to stop being so cautious. “The problem we have as Democrats is we throw a punch, and then we pull it back,” he told me. “We don’t want to get canceled by someone in our party.” I was eager to test this proposition, given that Martin is steeped in the cautious language of the Democratic big tent; God forbid he ever utter something hurtful or make someone feel (double God forbid ) unsafe or triggered.

So I asked Martin: What about Biden? Specifically, his fiasco of a presidential campaign. Didn’t he wait too long to bow out, and wasn’t it dumb for him to have run in the first place?

“It’s an academic exercise,” Martin said, ducking the question. “Do you have a time machine?”

“The point is,” Martin continued, “we don’t know for sure whether he should’ve or shouldn’t have, and we can’t change it.”

“What I’m interested in are things that will inform the next election.”

A few minutes later, Martin was back to talking tough about the importance of speaking freely and not caring about whom he antagonizes.

“I don’t give a fuck who I offend,” Martin declared.

“Listen, that has nothing to do with offending him or not,” Martin said. He reiterated that he is not in his job for glory. “All you do is get pissed on all the time,” he reminded me.

I was struck by how often Biden came up in my conversations with Democrats around the country. Specifically, people mentioned that his refusal to step away despite his obvious decline—and the refusal of Democratic leaders to acknowledge this decline until it was too obvious to ignore—was a betrayal that the party has yet to reckon with or recover from. “If their line was As long as the president’s not senile—I just have a higher bar than that,” James Talarico said.

“When you tell people that the thing that they are seeing isn’t true,” Graham Platner said, “they’re going to stop fucking believing you. Because you’re obviously lying.”

The lie has become a proxy for distrust of Democratic leaders on issues across the board. It’s a big reason Democrats have lost significant ground with a constituency that was once solidly theirs—the youth vote. “When we told them the president is too old, they told us, ‘No, he’s not; look how strong he is,’ ” David Hogg told me.

To his supporters, Trump approximates what “strong” looks like and what a “man” looks like (and even what a “strongman” looks like). Despite his constant whining and incessant lies, Trump embodies for his base blunt honesty and brutish masculinity.

Let’s pause for a second to appreciate the richness of the irony here: Nearly every elected Republican in Washington who is not named Trump has allowed himself or herself to be effectively neutered by him. Republican “leaders” might fashion themselves as a pack of alpha dogs, but in fact they have proved themselves to be a pack of panting poodles. “They love to call us cucks,” Ken Casey, the lead singer and bassist for the punk band the Dropkick Murphys, told The Atlantic this past summer. “Which I find ironic because there’s a good portion of MAGA that would probably step aside and let Donald Trump have their way with their significant other if he asked.”

Ruben Gallego said that “if I was bullied as much as these Republicans are by President Trump and his followers, I would be so ashamed to see my family.”

The gap between how Trump is perceived by some Republicans (strong and confident) and his actual persona (overwrought and histrionic) is large. “He has built this sort of whole infrastructure around assuaging an insecurity that he has,” Abdul El‑Sayed, the Senate candidate from Michigan, told me. “He is so fragile that he builds this simulacrum of strength.”

I asked El‑Sayed what he meant by that. “It looks strong, and it’s enforced by other people thinking it’s strong,” he explained. “But if you actually got in a physical fight with Donald Trump, you’d kick his ass.”

For the record, El‑Sayed, who is 41, looks like he could kick most people’s asses, certainly mine. A former high-school wrestler and football player, he attended the University of Michigan, and then Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship; he was later appointed executive director of Detroit’s health department. He ran for governor in 2018, losing in the Democratic primary to the eventual winner, Gretchen Whitmer.

We were sitting in a café not far from El‑Sayed’s home in Ann Arbor. Fresh from his Saturday-morning workout, beads of sweat on his forehead and massive arms bulging through a tight black T-shirt, he was sipping a weird energy concoction containing espresso and wheat germ or something. El‑Sayed speaks bluntly about the need for a more muscular Democratic Party that fights harder, shows less mercy, and refuses to cede “masculinity” to the cartoonish version modeled by a president who plans to host an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout next summer at the White House. “If they go low, we don’t go high,” El‑Sayed told the crowd at a rally with Sanders that day in Kalamazoo. “We take ’em to the mud and choke ’em out.”

El‑Sayed is one of the many Democratic candidates and officials I spoke with who readily acknowledged that their party has been actively, albeit inadvertently, repelling men. “Every time you heard the word masculinity in Democratic spaces, it was always preceded by a particular adjective—toxic,” he said. “And if you condemn a whole group of people as toxic, don’t expect them to be like, Yeah, I want to be part of that.”

“When we say ‘The future is female,’ I get where that’s coming from,” Talarico told me. “But to a young guy, that kind of sounds like the future is not for them.”

It was the middle of October, and Talarico and I were talking in the lobby bar of a hotel in Arlington, Texas. Part of his political momentum has been grounded in novelty—Look, Democrats have found a guy they think can talk to Christians in Texas—but Talarico is legitimately talented. Even though he is in many ways more moderate than his primary opponent, Jasmine Crockett, if Talarico wins the nomination, Republicans will inevitably do what they’ve become so adept at: turn him into a one-dimensional embodiment of a radical Democrat and make the race a referendum on “woke” pronouns, DEI, and transgender issues.

Talarico might be especially vulnerable to this because of a remark he made in 2021, during a legislative debate. “God is nonbinary,” Talarico said, in a video clip that resurfaced this past fall. (Josh Barro, a political commentator who left the Republican Party in 2016 and is now a centrist Democrat, promptly weighed in with a Substack essay titled “The First Step to Winning Back the Senate: Don’t Nominate Anyone Who Said ‘God Is Non-Binary.’ ”)

When I mentioned to Talarico that statements such as “God is nonbinary” could present a problem for him, he said he thinks Republicans would have a much harder time turning his race into a referendum on divisive cultural issues in the way they did in 2024, because the dominant issues of 2026 will be the economy and the cost of living. “We’re always focused on what happened in the last election,” Talarico said. Especially, he noted, the stream of out-of-town reporters in their shiny new cowboy boots. Talarico said he can predict what the national press is going to ask: “It’s trans athletes, the ‘God is nonbinary’ thing.” (I felt seen. Or exposed.)

Focusing on cultural issues would be akin to “fighting the last war,” Talarico concluded, perhaps wishfully. But Spanberger’s campaign in Virginia last year provided validation for this. More than half of Republican ad money in her race was spent on anti-trans themes. “The attack ads were trying to do some sort of othering, right?” Spanberger told me. “It worked with Harris, and so then they presumed it could work with me.”

It didn’t. Spanberger figured—correctly—that every ad Republicans ran “talking about a bathroom, or trying to vilify kids, was a moment that they weren’t talking about the economy.” A poll conducted in the final weeks of the campaign found that transgender issues in schools were the top concern for only 4 percent of voters.

Talarico argued that Democrats should not curse the uncertainty they have endured, or treat this period as pointless. “There’s an opportunity here to redefine the Democratic Party,” he told me. “And you can’t do that if the brand is super set, or if there’s a strong leader at the top of the party.” This, he said, should excite anyone who wants to see the party grow and evolve. “The wilderness is where new ideas and new leaders and new movements come forth.”

As Talarico and I talked, a woman from the hotel front desk approached our table to warn us that a coyote had been spotted on the patio earlier. She showed us a picture of the creature on her phone, and we assured her that we would be careful.

Talarico remarked that the nasty interloper would provide good color for my story, and then recalled the time that former Governor Rick Perry had encountered a coyote while running outside Austin—and shot it dead.

“He jogs with a gun” was Talarico’s takeaway.

You never know what you’ll come across in the wilderness.

Although quantifying morale and momentum is hard, by the end of 2025, the Democrats were enjoying an upturn in both. Their message felt more focused, and their resolve stronger, than it had in a long time. Those off-year election wins helped, and so did Trump’s ongoing obfuscation of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which gave Democrats a righteous fight to engage in.

The president helped by continually serving up gold-plated symbolism: He demolished the East Wing of the White House so he could build a $400 million ballroom, and threw a Great Gatsby–themed party at Mar-a-Lago in the midst of a protracted government-shutdown fight that jeopardized health-care subsidies and SNAP benefits for tens of millions of Americans.

At the same time, Trump’s National Guard deployments and immigration-enforcement offensives in Democratic-run cities became more aggressive—and more unpopular. Social media served up a daily video deluge of heavily armed agents randomly manhandling dark-skinned people. Opposition to these incursions catalyzed a more determined resistance than Democrats had shown before. Trump’s approval ratings on immigration, which had been his strongest issue, have tanked.

In early November, I traveled to Chicago, the first midwestern blue city Trump had targeted for his immigration crackdowns. J. B. Pritzker, the Illinois governor and a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, found himself in an ongoing Chicago beef with federal authorities, trying to serve as resistance leader against Trump while keeping a volatile situation from exploding in America’s third-largest city.

The president had recently called for Pritzker to be jailed—a status symbol among high-profile Democratic governors who might run for president. (Pritzker and Gavin Newsom could wind up sharing both a jail cell and a debate stage.) I visited him on a sparkling fall day in Chicago. Or, as Trump called it, a “war zone” and “the most dangerous city in the world.”

At the time we spoke, Pritzker had been urging citizens to blow whistles when they saw federal agents in the area so potential targets could flee. (Really? I thought. Has it come to this? ) He was spending his days fielding insults from the president (the sturdy governor endured a lot of fat jokes) while suggesting that Trump himself was “suffering dementia.”

A former venture capitalist and an heir to the Hyatt-hotels fortune, Pritzker kept spitting out dire admonitions. He predicted that the presence of Trump-controlled security forces in Chicago and other cities might foreshadow federal tampering with the 2026 elections. “I think that all the pieces of something nefarious seem to be occurring, and I’m just putting the pieces together,” Pritzker said. “I’m hopeful I’m wrong, but I don’t think we can assume that I’m wrong.”

He was disappointed that it had taken so long for a robust resistance to Trump to coalesce. “My complaint is not about regular folks,” Pritzker said. “What I’ve been frustrated by is people who hold leadership positions. And I’m not talking about elected Democrats only. I’m talking about CEOs of companies. I’m talking about boards of universities. I’m talking about people who have influence, who have the ability to stand up, but are afraid.”

Pritzker talks a lot about Nazis. He does not hesitate to compare Trump’s authoritarian gambits to the rise of the Third Reich. A descendant of Jewish refugees whose family fled Ukrainian pogroms, Pritzker was talking like this even before the Chicago raids. In February 2025, he gave a speech about how “it took 53 days for the Nazis to tear down a constitutional republic,” he told me. “Authoritarianism happens fast.”

Pritzker is a billionaire—not exactly a beloved species among Democrats these days. Other than Trump and his court-flatterers, billionaires are probably the most agreed-upon class of boogeyman that Democrats have. In his 2018 run for governor, Pritzker said, one challenge was “overcoming” that.

“Overcoming being a billionaire?” I asked.

This seemed to irritate him. “In a Democratic primary,” he said, yes. He asked me to consider the challenges he’d surmounted in running for governor two years after Bernie Sanders had gotten half the vote in the Illinois Democratic primary with a “Billionaires are evil” message. Pritzker had weathered his billionaire status to defeat Republican Governor Bruce Rauner. If he ran for president in 2028, Pritzker said, he would have to face that “obstacle.”

Pritzker said he’s proud of the fact that many of Sanders’s 2016 supporters in Illinois have become strong supporters of his, despite his wealth. Like Newsom, Pritzker exemplifies how using competence and combativeness against Trump plays well with constituents—and can wipe out all kinds of political deficiencies.

While in town, I stayed at the Hilton Chicago, a 1,544-room landmark, built in 1927, on South Michigan Avenue. The hotel overlooks Grant Park. The last time I’d been there was 2008, when I covered Obama’s Election Night rally, one of the most unforgettable experiences of my career. The wholesome pride in Chicago was palpable that night: hometown pride and American pride, as well as a strong sense—or illusion, it turned out—of national unity. The Ethiopian cabdriver who drove me to O’Hare the next morning kept bursting into tears because, he said, he never expected that the people of his adopted country would elect a Black president.

Obama’s ascendancy that night also represented a 21st-century high point for the Democratic Party. Hope, change, all of those things. (As well as the racial backlash, prominently abetted by Trump.) That was a long time ago, and feels longer. The arc of the moral universe is complicated.

My last stop on the tour was a café in Toledo, Ohio, about two weeks before Christmas. Former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown was hosting a roundtable featuring seven Ohioans sharing stories about the financial pain that bloated health-care costs had inflicted on their families, compelling them to scale back their medical care.

One after another, the participants described, at times tearfully, how their struggles had been exacerbated by the Trump administration’s policies, especially the so-called big, beautiful bill that Republicans passed over the summer.

This was a classic Democratic campaign event, centered on the party’s most solid policy terrain—health care. It was also classic Sherrod Brown, a now-rare breed of working-class progressive who had managed to get himself elected three times to the Senate and seven times to the House, in a state that veered to the right during the Trump years. Brown, 73, finally saw his luck run out in 2024, when he lost his campaign for a fourth term to Bernie Moreno, a MAGA disciple.

When he lost, he assumed that his political career was over. “I really was not going to do this again. My wife didn’t want me to do it again, and my kids didn’t want me to do it again,” he told me. But when Trump returned to office and started wreaking even more havoc than he had in his first term, Brown saw an opening. He is now running for a seat held by a Republican incumbent, Jon Husted. “I’m going to win this race because the state is so different,” he said.

“Different from what it was last year,” Brown said, when Trump 2.0 was more popular, the Democrats were a mess, and it looked like Brown’s brand of nuts-and-bolts liberal politics was cooked. Now Trump is so much less popular that the abiding Democratic disarray might not matter.

I wanted to end this journey with Brown because he is not flashy or a media magnet or a handwringer or (bless the man) someone who gets hung up on white papers about why Democrats are adrift. He is simply seizing an opportunity the Republicans have handed him: Large majorities of voters are losing patience with Trump.

Last year, James Carville was criticized in some circles for his argument that Democrats would be best served by staying out of the way, suppressing their penchant for self-harm, and simply waiting for Trump and the Republicans to self-immolate. Which is essentially what they’ve done. Carville’s theory was and remains controversial—his critics point to the lasting damage Trump has inflicted everywhere since his rapacious return to office while the Democrats have looked on haplessly. But as the 2026 midterms approach, Carville’s advice seems likely to be vindicated.

Essentially: Do no harm, strive to remain at least in the ballpark of “normal,” and bank on one huge built-in advantage—opposition parties typically do well in midterms. Also, the past 10 years have shown repeatedly that Republicans vote far less reliably when Trump is not on the ballot. Finally, for all the blundering, there remain just two viable political parties in the United States, and the Democrats are still one of them, despite themselves. No party wants to “lose America,” as the white papers put it. But when the other side is destroying it, there are worse things to be than the alternative.

That&#39;s what happened when they gave my uncle ivermectin to treat COVID. He died that night. They need to ban ivermectin and sue the doctors that prescribed it.

What he is mocking is bullshit, and it should be mocked. And so should cowards.

Think that&#39;s bad, I ended up with Gavino&#39;s head!

Such a pity modern medicine gave you a chance to survive, without it we&#39;d be without you and with an improved gene pool.

Cool story, bro. But you need to work on the lie. A death the next day is not even remotely credible. Just claim he dies a week later. You may also want to replace &quot;heart strain&quot; with something else, because if you actually get that from one shot (which is very, very rare), you will NOT get a second one.

Did you write that will eating McDonalds and sucking on a Zyn pouch?

To make this still a success. Irrationality is not everywhere in power. And a better flu shot is overdue.

Mexico, please provide medical assistance to US. at least to its citizens who long for the days when we believed in science.

The gates foundation, which is no longer the bill and Melinda Gates foundation since she had her name taken off of it for Bill-gave-her-an-STD-from-Epstein-Island (or perhaps ranch) reasons, is very effective at making Bill Gates rich again. And isn&#39;t that what philanthropy is all about?

Anti-Vax attitudes have gotten people killed

Excessive &quot;group-think&quot; type stupidity always gets people killed. The sad fact is that these are often not part of the stupid. We have way too many malicious people in the human race.

The biggest lie in your post is when you said you could read.

No. You were banned from spreading lies. There is a difference, even if you are clearly far too deep in delusion to be able to understand that. Or you are just a fundamentally corrupt and deeply malicious person. Would not rule that out.

We&#39;ll spend a century claiming we are Canadian when we travel abroad. At least we got practice under &quot;Ireq&quot; Bush.

And it seems we have these to avoid.https://www.dailykos.com/stori... [dailykos.com]

And in actual reality, no actual expert ever claimed it would &quot;prevent&quot; the spreading. Because that is not how things work. It is about slowing things down and reducing the death toll, and not just by a bit.

You are a clueless asshole. Please shut up before you get more people killed.

It is buried in the story, but the objection is that Moderna wants to compare their new product&#39;s safety against their last product, and not against an inert placebo.

For anyone who has ever built anything, you know that you must always measure from the same baseline, and never measure from your last hole.  When you are mentoring a young person, you tell them &quot;Don&#39;t stack your errors.&quot;  Try building a cabinet some time by putting the holes for the shelf pins an inch from the previous hole instead of X inches

First, phase 3 studies are by definition not safety studies, but efficacy studies on a large number of test subjects. Safety studies are phase 1.

Second, ethics guidelines stipulate that you must provide state of the art care for those subjects which do not get the new vaccine, with very tight exceptions. For flu shots, it means that everyone gets a shot, either with a traditional vaccine or the new one, since it is universally accepted outside the new FDA that a classical shot is better than placebo.

I don&#39;t want to seem like I&#39;m being evasive, but I don&#39;t think people should be taking medical advice from me.&quot; https://www.cbsnews.com/news/r... [cbsnews.com]

Discord is a target of &#39;child safety&#39; spyware demanded by the governments of the world, and a target of users who realize Discord tracking them, makes them a victim.

Funny, when my Kia had nothing but McDonald&#39;s wrappers and old copies of Hustler in there, I never had a break-in.  Once I started keeping my expensive tools and collection of rare Labubus in it, nothing but trouble.

Concern over FISA orders in situations like this is way overblown.  You should be concerned about orders available in any lawsuit, like OpenAI being ordered to hand over lots of its chat logs in the NYT copyright lawsuit.  You should be concerned about sales of access to information, like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.  You should be concerned about compromise of material in a jack by criminals or a nation-state.  Unless you are a terrorist or foreign intelligence asset, the risk of those dwarfs the risk

you have no clue what you are talking about. There is no way they decided to do this on their own. I have been writhing software for 50 years. Not once ever has any one come come up with something like this unless they were told to do it.

This is Trump bullshit he wants to know who says what.

perhaphs a pki-like verification system that a &quot;trusted&quot; 3rd party verifies age without giving id/personal data to a known leaker,

This is by far the easiest.  One goes to an age clearinghouse, get a certification so they can link an account, even if it is their troll shit-post account... who cares... it just shows that the account is over 18.

However... dataz.  Being able to sell to age groups is a big thing, because kids buy a lot of stuff, especially at the vulnerable times where imprinting them with needing to buy items or wear products in order to be accepted into daily society is a must.  Everyone wants that age data, either to se

... too complex bloatware for instant messaging wants personal information? i smell big brother, and since i am irl big brother, one is enough.

Plus nitro. They&#39;ve been mad at pushing nitro everywhere. Makes you want to vomit every time you see it.

Most countries that introduced age verification requirements state that verification must be &quot;highly effective&quot;. Would this predictive profiling be enough in the court of law?

It&#39;s probably stuff like the age of the account. If it&#39;s 10 years old, the chance that the owner is under 13 and registered it as a toddler is quite small. If they have made purchases with a credit card, or linked a phone number to it, that sort of thing.

Level of language, types of topics, age of account, etc.

We&#39;ve covered the accuracy of predictive profiling time and time again. The amount of insight you can gain from someone&#39;s behaviour is truly immense. Remember the case of Target being criticised for sending pregnancy related products to a teen girl based purely on purchasing behaviour, only for it later to come out that she was pregnant despite her not telling anyone?

Highly effective is a word distinct from &quot;perfect&quot;. I think it would be an easy bar to pass algorithmically given the information platforms sl

i am not a discord user, does discord monitor the app usage/conversations are not private? i thought the servers were private enclaves without giving access to discord the company?

... than yet another glorified and way overrated IRC/XChat clone like Slack or other candidates - will only take me a few minutes. As soon as they get more annoying than convenient I&#39;m out. For all I care they might as well just go broke already, since they&#39;re still not profitable. No need to try to gain any mass by starting this uber-surveillance thing. It won&#39;t pan out anyway, so they might aswell just give up.

It&#39;s easy to replace Discord if no one wants to talk to yoiu.

My daughter plays Roblox. They are asking her to take a selfie to get assigned to an age group.

https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/... [roblox.com]

Seriously, they are planning to use some AI doodad to place you into a group &quot;Your estimated age helps place you in the appropriate age group (5-8, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20, and 21+) to customize your experience on Roblox&quot;. I&#39;ve known people that have baby faces in their 30&#39;s, and I&#39;ve seen preteens that have started showing off beard. And this is all based on some image recognition thingamajick?

Most countries at least in EU have some sort of governmental identity mechanism, that allows you to make strong identification to any service. Why does this have to be some sort of AI magic that steals your data, when this all could be handled by a simple federated identity tokens. Just go to your government site, ask it to generate a signed token that states &quot;On this day, holder of this token is X years of age&quot;, lifetime of token can be like 15 minutes. No need for government to learn what were you visiting and no need for the service to know all other details either.

They are already utilizing some third party to do the selfie recognition and evaluation, why couldn&#39;t the same third party pass a token between gov website and the service with the same price?

No method (regardless how clever) and solve the root problem: A child can ask its 18 year old friend to unlock the account.You can find ways to prove age, but there are no reasonable ways to prove the current user is the person who proved to be 18+

At least the video-thing. They stated processing locally only and nothing about storage. That means, at least in Europe, they are not legally allowed to do any storage and they must keep the data local or being in direct, non-accidental violation of the GDPR. Fines go up to 5% of annual global (!) turnover and, for repeat offenders, a prohibition to process or store any personal data.

Now, I have zero trust in their integrity or honor. But people will be looking and exfiltrating that video data or storing it

They already had a leak of data they were supposed to have deleted. I wouldn&#39;t trust them.

Now every user needs to think about if they behave like an underage user.Better not login at times pupils have free time. Login early on holiday days to prove that you&#39;re not a child sleeping long at the day off. Make sure not to click like on silly memes. Join some servers that look boring to kids.That&#39;s just another way to make users self-censor.

You know, when you put it like that I realize Discord might be massively improved if users are given incentive not to act like they&#39;re underage and immature.

You just ask for age verification. At that time, if they find you to not be underage, they do not ask again. As reverse ageing is not a thing, that makes sense.

According to reddit, users are approaching this by:

why the fuck doesn&#39;t someone pursue criminal charges of neglect against parents for allowing their children unsupervised access to a known dangerous place (i.e., the internet).

Their damned kids would be safe if they were properly supervised.

We went from privacy consciousness and being scared of government bugs planted everywhere to giving ALL our information away for practically free AND running as many bugs and cameras in and around our houses, voluntarily.

It is absolutely more than enough to slap an extensive form or a prompt in front of somebody and they will happily enter all their information. Even games are now allegedly-AI-scanning your face to create your in-game avatar and people actually do this. Then they film and publish their live

..are always a bit unevenIt takes a while for stability to mature

Yeah, I guess, it is a bit uneven and unstable if it leaves you free time.

The even and stable implementation when it arrives will work like that ole Matrix, you&#39;ll be born plugged in and working overtime while receiving false dreams to keep you happy - until you&#39;re worn off and they flush you out.

Dunno about the article, but I&#39;ve seen the &quot;tools&quot; and it is as if they are hand-coded by imbeciles who have never done more than hobbyist coding. The so-called &quot;agentic architecture&quot; is just moronic, as if a drunk freshman vibe-vomited right after the final exams for the fall session.

It is as if all knowledge of client-server architectures was lost and the teenagers that play with this shit have to reinvent the wheel and the bicycle again.

But we know why everyone needs 500 datacenters powered by 50 nuclear

I think the idea that people are going to replace real client server software with this stuff is off base.  What it is actually great for is automating shorter lived process.

Hey can we just collect this data and maybe separate it in to useful fields like in a sharepoint list or something and when the developers get a real ERP module completed we can import the data. Better yet lets figure out what the process looks like with this stuff then create proper software to support after we know what the real world

I just found out the most interesting thing I can do with copilot at work: turn it off. In VS code, the bottom right copilot button has a &quot;snooze&quot; option. I use it because inserted garbage comments break my train of thought.

I don&#39;t say it&#39;s not useful. But it does drive me nuts sometimes.

has been utter shit for decades. It glorifies overtime over everything else - including over metrics that could be improved with less overtime, such as quality and efficiency.

AI is just more of the same: turbocharged shit.

I&#39;m saying this as an American expat living in Europe and actually having a quality of life and work/life balance I never had stateside.

Itâ(TM)s not privilegeâ¦itâ(TM)s a choice that requires effort and work to unlock. Itâ(TM)s a lot easier than most people think.

Disclaimer: former US American citizen turned European here

The system and culture in the US is pretty broken in key parts, that&#39;s for sure. Europe is aging and has a demographic bomb coming up, but by and large quality of living is higher by default these days. Healthcare, safety nets and a (somewhat) sane system of taxation are all part of this. I hope any US revolution that might be upcoming will be peaceful and that some basics will be factory-reset to some saner defaults.

The employees&#39; to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.This phrase implies that AI made them more efficient (and the only problem they had was to have realistic limitations).

This phrase implies that AI made them more efficient (and the only problem they had was to have realistic limitations).

Be thanked for being more productive by getting more tasks. Then wonder why you burn out, when you do 100 things fast instead of 10 slow.

Echos of this have been around in the past.  The computer allowed people to get a lot more done, so they spent more time on it.  Same with the Internet.  When you have a tool that is a force multiplier, you want to hit the gas on it and see what it can do.

This is normal.  In the past, force multipliers for me have been getting a central Git system in place, a central documentation system, a ticket system, from there working with reports.  AI helps accelerate that even more.

So they&#39;re rediscovering what any artist who create for a living has learned - you can&#39;t produce good work all the time by the hour.

... Chillout time. No joke. My productivity has gone 5x in the last 6 months, especially with the newest models and them spitting out boring but maintainable boilerplate code for me and explaining the details of what they&#39;re doing, but overall my life has become more chill. I&#39;ve started taking naps at noon when I&#39;m in homeoffice.

Then again, I&#39;m an experienced senior webdev, the new product we&#39;re building has is architecture 100% designed and maintained by me alone and with AI I basically have a team 5 junio

That&#39;s the point, but not always what they achieve. Abstractions are always well intended but rarely well done.

The news has been filled with articles about companies proclaiming how they are going all in on AI.I wonder how long until we see the first articles about companies proclaiming they are ditching AI and the benefits / competitive advantage they seek to reap from doing so?

I work the same hours. I just have one more tool in the toolbox.

Sounds like a case where one could accurately say &quot;you&#39;re holding it wrong&quot; ...

A corporation is not physically capable of appreciating you.

You exist to be used and discarded. There&#39;s another one like you waiting for a job.

Doesn&#39;t matter, the US bases would probably in uninhabited regions of Iceland anyways. He&#39;ll just get it cheaper after AMOC collapse.

There&#39;s already a NATO base here, at Keflavík (conjoining the international airport). It was abandoned in 2006 but it&#39;s been moving toward increased usage.  That would surely be the primary base if the US invaded us.

I take talk of potential US invasions of us deadly seriously.  Defending Greenland against European counters - and in general excluding European control of the North Atlantic as a whole - would be vastly easier if the US captured Iceland. Maintaining a major airbase in Iceland is *far* easi

I don&#39;t think la Presidenta thinks that far ahead. And there&#39;s little chance of piping Iceland&#39;s geothermal energy to Greenland. It would make more sense to ship the crap to Iceland and refine it there. So that asshole has to invade two islands.

la Presidenta also hasn&#39;t figured out Greenland is covered in ice, lots of it. He sees the word &quot;Greenland&quot; and is imagining a tropical paradise. Any mineral recovery would be expensive and very damaging to the environment. Of course, he might go for it just for the

I don&#39;t think la Presidenta thinks that far ahead.

It&#39;s not about what he thinks, it&#39;s about what his advisors think.

For a long time, he consistently referred to Greenland as Greenland.  Then suddenly, in a press conference out of the blue, he kept calling it Iceland.  Lead theory in the press here is that some of his advisors were discussing Iceland during a meeting about Greenland, and thus caused his confusion.

And there&#39;s little chance of piping Iceland&#39;s geothermal energy to Greenland.

Ah, would that be Greenland you&#39;re thinking of?

My take on this story is that Iceland is predicted to be less of a green land, whereas Greenland is probably going to be even more of an ice land.

Even if their island becomes 100% hostile to all life, the Icelanders can always power artificial life with the free energy they&#39;re blessed with: the uninterrupted source of heat coming from the bowels of the Earth.

They&#39;re in a quasi-unique position of not really having to worry about climate change, if worse comes to worst.

Right. Meanwhile down in the tropics they could just use the free energy from the sun to power the A/C if the heat becomes too extreme.

Were you born this stupid or do you have to practice at it?

It depends on how fast it happens.  Our buildings are not built for temperatures that low.  A typical January day has a high just above freezing and a low just below it.

If change happens at the same sort of speed that housing is replaced / new infrastructure is built, yes, we can adapt.  But I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;re supposed to bear the cost of renovating every building in the country at once and dramatically expanding our energy production, if it were to happen quickly. There&#39;s also what it would do to our e

_And_ other places will get hotter, as less heat is transported away by the AMOC. So those places may become uninhabitable by being so hot and humid that humans will just overheat and die from heat stroke.

... northern Europe and the northern Atlantic in the unique position of becoming the earths new coldest point on earth. Iceland would be affected, as would Scandinavia, Germany and some other regions. Given that Germany enjoys a relatively moderate climate considering its latitude position on the globe these assumptions are plausible. If the gulf stream goes away, Germany will get colder.

As mentioned, that is pretty unique, globally speaking.

Global warming is going to make things colder?Yes, potentially. The effects of global warming on AMOC and the consequences have been explored in the scientific literature since the 1970s.

A country looks into the future and sees something bleak. Then they begin to plan for it.

Imagine how stupid they would be if they just denied it, turned a blind eye, and then actively attempted to accelerate directly toward it.

I mean, to be fair, Denmark nearly did order Iceland evacuated during the Mist Hardships after the eruption of Laki.

We tend not to get &quot;geologically-catastrophic&quot; eruptions here like, say, Yellowstone.  But we get &quot;historically-catastrophic&quot; eruptions surprisingly often, once every 100-200 years or so.  For example, the largest lava flow on Earth in the entire Holocene is in Iceland, the jórsárhraun, from Bárðarbunga.

Take Laki for example.  A 25 kilometer long fissure &quot;unzipped&quot;. Lava fo

It says in the summary that you can upload audio as well. Bytedance actually demonstrated the audio bit years ago. They had about 10 seconds of speech, and from that it could extrapolate a reasonably believable artificial voice. Scammers have been using the tech for years.

Yes, presumably the AI gets confused when you start adding different countries into the equation. If you have identical twins growing up in different places - Scotland and Australia, say - how is the AI going to account for the large differences in accents?

“Sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt you guys.” The man crunches his way toward us, through this snow-covered field and past rows upon rows of identical wooden tombstones, then gestures back in the direction he came from. “I wanted to make sure you’re aware that there’s ICE right there.”

This is how it happens, I was told the day before. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moves fast in Minneapolis, the way you have to when an entire city is against you. Volunteers call in license plates to volunteers who check those plates against databases created by other volunteers. Once identified, these agents have minutes at best before residents with whistles and horns and furious loud voices gather to alert their neighbors to the threat in their midst. If you’re more than five minutes away from a sighting, odds are you’ll be too late. No, the best way to find ICE in Minneapolis is to stay in one place. Go about your day. Eventually, you’ll see them.

I am standing with two Minneapolis residents who go by Tim and Star, looking out at the Say Their Names memorial. The art installation consists of over 100 tombstones, each with identical black fists and names I remember from 2020. Philandro Castile. Ahmaud Arbery. And, of course, George Floyd, who took his final breath two blocks south of here. Minneapolis is no stranger to tragedy, or to the white-hot spotlight of international media attention, or to banding together in the face of a crisis.

“In some ways, it primed the pump,” Tim told me, referring to the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Like everyone I spoke to, Tim and Star ascribe Minneapolis’ successful mobilization to lessons learned during that time.

“We have a lot of media coming in and asking, ‘Oh, what’s your organization? Who are you with?’ And it’s like, we don’t have an organization. We’re not with anyone,” Star told me.

“We’re just neighbors. That’s how we know each other,” Tim confirmed. “We live here.”

Star nodded. “ One of the things that I’m not sure that people are realizing outside of Minneapolis: The headlines say that Alex Pretti was a protester,” they say. “He wasn’t at a protest. He wasn’t at—”

And then we turned to watch the man approaching us through the snow—the man now telling us ICE has pulled up by an apartment building across the field. “We’ve got the block, we’re situated,” he says. “I just want to make sure—in case anybody’s targetable or something like that.”

None of us are targetable. Tim and Star want to help, and I want to see the action.

Just as roadkill summons vultures, so too does human misery summon journalists, who travel across the country to shove cameras and recorders at people enduring things no one should experience. People in Minneapolis broadly understand that documentation is important, that the world needs to know what’s happening, that journalists can help spread the word. But the line between journalism and pornography grows vanishingly thin at times like these. Newsworthy tales of ICE atrocities can easily become violent entertainment for a ravenous national audience; action-movie sequences carried out by caricatures, grief and trauma commodified for mass consumption.

Star offers me a 3D-printed orange whistle and I open my mouth to say that as a journalist I can’t participate—but the words won’t come out. A sudden vision of myself in the future, talking to grand-nieces and -nephews: Yes, I had a chance to warn people about the secret police coming to abduct them, disappear them, or release them into this dangerous cold without a coat or cell phone, but journalistic ethics, you see …

At last, the cars arrive. The bearded man gives us a count: One, two, three …

The noise is deafening: Horns blare, whistles pierce the piercing cold. “ICE OUT!” the residents chant, over and over again. “We are all Minneapolis!” someone shouts. “We are all Minnesota! We are all the motherfucking United States of America!”

The world might breathe a sigh of relief, but Minneapolis can’t afford it. ICE is here, and ICE has killed, and ICE may kill again. Here the city stands: residents with whistles standing against men with guns and flak vests.

The ICE SUV stays put despite the unrelenting noise and a neighborhood now on high alert. I start shivering five minutes in; the man in sweatpants and Crocs appears unbothered. There are over 30 people here now; residents have heeded the call or arrived from rapid-response patrol. A white Toyota stops between the crowd and the SUV and a man with a mustache leans out the passenger window with a camera: no words, no eye contact, just the indifferent glassy eye of a zoom lens and fingers to focus it on people as they do something others have died doing.

Someone has brought a megaphone; residents take turns leading chants. “My grandmother was a sharecropper in Arkansas, and I know that this is the same thing,” a man shouts at one point as whistles shrill and a handheld siren wails. “The same fight that my people fought, the same fight that my grandma fought, is the same fight that we are fighting to protect our undocumented migrant neighbors!”

ICE-watch reports more agents incoming, but the crowd has only grown and no one is going anywhere. Five minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 15. “All right folks, we’re going to sing ‘We are not afraid!’ ” someone shouts into the megaphone, and so they do; not shouting or chanting but singing, in tune and with one voice:

We are not afraid We are not afraid We are not afraid today

Oh, deep in my heart I do believe That we are not afraid today

And then, to the sound of sporadic laughter, the amplified voice sings a slightly altered version:

ICE will leave ICE will leave Oh, deep in my heart I do believe ICE will leave RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MINNEAPOLIS! THIS IS OUR FUCKING STREET!

Laughter and cheers and the handheld siren wails and the man with the megaphone keeps shouting: “The people are not with you! The people are with us! And they want you to get the fuck out of our city!”

A few minutes later, the SUV lurches forward, then drives slowly down the street. The residents cheer and taunt and follow from a safe distance. Whatever the bastards had planned for the apartment complex will have to wait for another day. “That’s the most exciting laundry I’ve ever done,” a man with a gray beard says dryly, then walks back into everyday life, to the extent that everyday life is possible anymore.

Why do people continue to push back, knowing what it might mean? It’s the question I’m here to ask, and so I approach two people and ask it. “ I’d love to know what inspires you to come out here, knowing that people have been killed doing this shit. You can also tell me to fuck off.”

The resident studies me for several seconds. “I’m not going to tell you to fuck off,” she says at last. “But I don’t think I want to answer.”

“It feels like the only way through it is through it,” Tim says when I ask him the same question a few minutes later. “Some of this is—it’s happening to us. And it’s a choice to stand up, but—” He pauses. “We don’t have a lot of options.”

The day before this standoff on 37th and Columbus, I spent all day in a rapid-response chat with dozens of volunteers: people who had to excuse themselves to pick up kids from school, people on their way home willing to spare an hour to keep their community safe. The tone was matter-of-fact, direct, resolute, but moments of fear crept in. I could hear it in the voice of a woman who reported an ICE agent getting out of his car, and in two watchers who declined to follow an agent who drove “aggressively” toward them in his car. “Stay safe,” they told each other by way of goodbye, with the kind of intensity reserved for people who understand that might not be possible.

Later that night, I went to a “Hotel Wide-Awake” demonstration outside the four-star Hilton in downtown Minneapolis where ICE has rented a block of rooms. Hundreds of protesters stood outside in subzero temperatures and made as much noise as possible—banging pots, blowing whistles, drumming on buckets, blowing trombones and trumpets. Police in riot gear stood menacingly in front of the hotel, then eventually dispersed the protest by force around 10 p.m.

“I’m not as afraid as I thought I would be,” a woman who goes by L told me at the Hilton Wide-Awake. She wore a backpack with a piece of paper taped to the back that said “Free Supplies”: first aid, handwarmers, earplugs. “I guess I just feel like I can take it, so I want to put myself as a body here. They can’t hurt all of us if it’s really big, and there are a lot of people who can’t necessarily be out here or don’t want to take the risk. But because I feel like I can accept that risk, I have to.”

In three days, I will drive out of Minneapolis and back to my home in New York City. Tim, and Star, and the man with the beard, and the woman who did not want to answer—these people are already home. No one asked them if they wanted to be on the front lines of the fight against ICE. They did not volunteer for this assignment. The assignment came to them.

“I wish I had the answer for why are we doing it,” Star says. “It’s an act of service. I don’t know. And it’s—so you can’t save everybody, right? And you maybe can’t even save anybody. Like maybe all we do is frustrate. You know, give someone one more day with their daughter or their dad. But if you lost your dad, or you lost your daughter, you would give anything to have one more day with them. And that’s what we can do.”

President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign seemed to hit a horrifying crescendo in the last month, with chaos in the streets of Minneapolis stretching the city’s populace to a near-breaking point. Unfortunately, the situation is about to get worse. On Friday, two far-right judges greenlit the Trump administration’s radical reinterpretation of federal law that would sweep millions more immigrants into mandatory detention, potentially expanding the mass deportation machinery in new and horrifying ways. Their 2–1 decision for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would transform the entire United States into a permanent border zone where unauthorized immigrants can be jailed indefinitely without bond, even years after they arrived. It supercharges the administration’s push to build an archipelago of mass detention centers larger than any existing jail or prison in the country. These mega-warehouses—which are not designed for human habitation—will hold up to 10,000 immigrants each, with little oversight and little recourse for detainees whose rights are violated. Even as public outrage over Trump’s mass deportation campaign intensifies, the legal and physical infrastructure of the plan are rapidly falling into place.

The 5th Circuit’s Friday decision gives new legal muscle to the Stephen Miller–orchestrated mass deportation campaign by endorsing the administration’s audacious rereading of a 1996 immigration law governing the detention of unauthorized migrants. For nearly 30 years, both the executive branch and the federal judiciary have understood this statute to draw a sharp line between migrants “seeking admission” at the border and those already in the country. The former are subject to mandatory detention without bond (with a few narrow exceptions). The latter, by contrast, can seek release on bond. If that request is denied, they can demand a bond hearing before an immigration judge. Most of the roughly 11 million immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. today fall into this second, bond-eligible group.

In July, the Trump administration collapsed the long-standing distinction between new arrivals and everyone else. It announced that it had “revisited” its view of the law and concluded that unauthorized immigrants already present in the United States are subject to mandatory detention, just like migrants encountered at the border. To reach that result, the government asserted that anyone who was never legally admitted to the country must, by definition, be “seeking admission” today. Under its theory, an immigrant who has lived here for decades is subject to the same harsh rules as someone who tried to cross the border yesterday. This shift empowered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain exponentially more immigrants without bond, prompting a flood of habeas petitions from those detainees challenging their confinement. Indeed, according to ProPublica, noncitizens have filed more of these petitions in the last 13 months than in the last three administrations combined.

Although the Trump-stacked Board of Immigration Appeals swiftly adopted the administration’s distortion of the statute, federal judges have overwhelmingly rejected it and freed detainees in habeas proceedings. As Kyle Cheney reported in Politico, at least 360 judges have spurned the government’s reasoning in more than 3,000 cases. They’ve done so in increasingly alarmed terms. Last week, Judge Thomas E. Johnston, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote: “It is appalling that the government insists that this Court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” deriding the administration’s theory as “dystopian absurdity.”

The problem, as these judges have explained, is that an unauthorized immigrant who’s already present in the country is not “seeking admission” at all; they are seeking to remain here. Yet ICE is detaining them under a statute reserved for new arrivals. By doing so, the agency is flagrantly breaking the law. So judges keep ordering ICE to release detainees—orders the agency has repeatedly flouted, prompting scathing judicial rebukes around the country.

On Friday, however, the administration finally caught a break at the 5th Circuit, the nation’s most reactionary appeals court. Justice Department officials maneuvered to ensure that the court would take up the question as quickly as possible, evidently hoping to notch a win. Two far-right judges, Edith Jones and Kyle Duncan, were happy to oblige: They embraced the administration’s reinterpretation on an expedited schedule, over a furious dissent by Judge Dana Douglas, who warned: “The border is now everywhere.” With this decision in hand, ICE can enforce the mandatory detention policy in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the three states covered by the circuit. (The agency had been funneling migrants from other jurisdictions into these states already, perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling.)

Jones and Duncan’s rush to bless this mandatory detention policy smooths the path for another component of Trump’s mass deportation push: The use of mega-warehouses to detain up to 10,000 noncitizens each and supplement the much smaller facilities that currently house detainees. ICE has been buying up these warehouses over the last few months—reportedly above market value to speed up the transactions—and converting them into makeshift detention camps. More than a quarter of the proposed sites fall within the 5th Circuit. As the American Immigration Council’s Aaron Reichlin-Melnick has pointed out, these detention facilities will house far more people than any jail or prison in the U.S. today.

Reichlin-Melnick told me on Tuesday that the mandatory detention policy now supported by the 5th Circuit is “a key part of the plan to fill these warehouses.” To achieve “the broader project of mass deportation,” Reichlin-Melnick said, “you need both the legal authority and physical space.” The government’s draconian rereading of immigration law “provides the legal authority. Warehouses provide the physical spaces.”

The overarching goal is to condemn as many noncitizens as possible to these sites, then hold them there without bond until they are so desperate and miserable that they agree to be deported. ICE already subjects its detainees to horrific, degrading, and inhumane conditions while blocking attempts at meaningful oversight. The situation may grow even more dire once the agency begins locking hundreds of thousands of noncitizens—many of whom may have lived here for years with pending legal claims to resolve their status—in industrial buildings that were never designed to hold human beings. Those subject to abuse at the hands of ICE officers will have no real mechanism for redress.

Even before the mandatory detention policy, noncitizens faced an uphill battle when seeking bond before an immigration judge. Trump purged many of these judges (who lack tenure) for alleged leniency, replacing them with ideologically aligned substitutes. But release on bond was still a real possibility for those who could show that they did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Now the government has shut off that safety valve, and—at least in the 5th Circuit—the machinery of detention can run at full speed. A series of Supreme Court decisions have closed off the possibility of a nationwide injunction or class action that could put a stop to this regime all at once. Immigrants’ only hope is that SCOTUS will swiftly and definitively shoot down the government’s contortion of the statute.

There is some reason for optimism that it will. Just eight years ago, the conservative justices appeared to foreclose the conflation of new arrivals and longer-term residents, acknowledging that the latter group is eligible for bond. But this Supreme Court has repeatedly twisted the law for Trump, particularly in his quest to immiserate noncitizens, and there’s no guarantee it will resist this act of legal vandalism. The administration is proceeding as if it already has the justices in its pocket. Unless and until they intervene, each new warehouse moves the country one step closer to the president’s vision of an American gulag.

The past month has seen a barrage of election subversion stories that, taken individually, were alarming, but viewed together reveal a deeply disturbing new playbook emanating from the Trump administration ahead of the midterms. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick talked with election law gladiator Marc Elias, chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket. Their discussion, edited and condensed for clarity here, highlights a very clear pattern when it comes to Trump and voting: a project that seeks to normalize violence and to test drive the shattering of how elections are typically run. The work of the coming nine months? Keep a close eye on the encroaching lawlessness, don’t normalize election subversion, and organize now to protect your friends and neighbors.

Dahlia Lithwick: When Steve Bannon pledged last week that ICE is going to “surround the polls”—that the federal government is going to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to patrol polling stations during the midterms—is he trolling, or something we should be taking literally and seriously?

Marc Elias: I don’t think he’s trolling us, I think he’s quite serious. I think Donald Trump wants to maintain optionality here. Trump has put federal paramilitary forces in a number of American cities. Everyone’s focused on Minneapolis, but let’s be clear, it’s not only Minneapolis. Part of it is because he obviously has an anti-immigrant agenda he wants to pursue, but he also wants to normalize the idea of seeing people with flash-bang grenades and tear gas breaking windows and dragging people out of cars, and telling U.S. citizens that they’re being put in databases, and grabbing U.S. citizens and throwing them in the back of vans. Trump wants to normalize all of that because that has a number of side benefits, none so great as potentially using those same forces and same tactics around the midterm elections—not to go after noncitizens, and not even specifically focused on being right around polling places, but just more generally making it more intimidating to vote, making it more inconvenient to get to polling locations, and in its most extreme form, yes, surrounding polling locations and intimidating people or preventing voting altogether.

So I guess the follow-up is just my lawyerly question, which is: Of course it’s not lawful to deploy federal troops or armed federal law enforcement to polling places. The Brennan Center is very clear—it’s a crime for anyone in the military to interfere with elections. So doesn’t this discussion begin and end with the fact that you just can’t?

It doesn’t, for two reasons. First of all, we began the administration with people thinking, Oh my God, what if he puts the military at the polls? And I think Donald Trump has figured out that he’s better off with paramilitary forces than the actual U.S. military. The military may be too disciplined and too principled to do what he wants here, so he’s found other federal law enforcement personnel and agencies willing to do his dirty work. We’ve seen that progression between L.A.—where we saw the National Guard deployed—and now Minneapolis, where we’ve seen ICE and Border Patrol.

More fundamentally, though, what you have is a president who himself enjoys absolute immunity and will wield the pardon power, and that makes saying something is “illegal” a lot less of a credible threat. When you also have a Department of Justice that would never prevent them from doing those things, and in fact would go to court to enable those things … it doesn’t take law off the table, and I never want people to think that the courts are not able to address some of these things, because I think, in fact, the courts have proven the most capable of being checks on Donald Trump. I can promise you lawyers like me will be in court, and we will fight against this, and we may very well win, but it doesn’t mean that he won’t try or that he won’t actually get cooperation from his own administration to do these things.

Also last week, President Trump said the time has come to “nationalize elections.” Can you talk us through what lies beneath that threat? Is there some tangible plan he’s referencing, or is this just another one of his I want what I want and I want it now, and I want these 15 Democratic jurisdictions to be monitored by me.

I think a couple of things here are important. The first is that when he says he wants to “nationalize” the elections, I fear some people think that he’s talking about something like uniform standards across the country, some terrible but nevertheless uniform application of voting standards that would apply in Alabama equally as they would  apply in, say, New York.

But if you look at the broader quote, he’s making false claims about people coming to the country illegally to vote, and then he says, “It’s amazing that the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting.’ The voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” So I want to be clear, he’s not talking about nationalizing election administration. He is talking about Republicans taking over the voting, and then identifying that there would be specific jurisdictions in which they would take over that voting. We can assume that those 15 would grow to be beyond 15, and that it would be places with large concentrations of Democratic votes. He’s talking about a partisan takeover, not a federal-versus-state takeover.

The second thing is, I think that the big lie that he is selling in 2026 is his own power regarding these elections. What he’s really doing in this statement is he’s suggesting that the president has powers over elections that he doesn’t have. What we’re seeing is a progression and an escalation. I want everyone to go back in their heads and remember that 2020 didn’t start with a violent insurrection of the nation’s Capitol, it actually started with Donald Trump before the election, well before the election, saying that we can’t have all these mail-in ballots, right? He was railing against mail-in ballots, and then there was litigation before the election about mail-in voting, and in-person voting, and all kinds of stuff, and many in the traditional legacy media treated that as if it was the normal jockeying before elections, and people like me and you were saying, “No! This is actually not normal, this is actually quite extraordinary!”

Then Donald Trump loses the election, and he files not one lawsuit, but he and his allies file 64 lawsuits—which, again, completely not normal! If you go back, maybe in the totality of Bush v. Gore, with all of the subsidiary little issues, maybe there were a dozen cases? But that was one state involving a very, very close margin, decided by the Supreme Court. In 2020, this was a scattershot approach with a lot of bullshit legal theories. And when that didn’t work, he escalated. This is the pivot point that people sometimes look past. On Dec. 19, 2020, after the Electoral College met, the state of Texas filed a petition directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. You know how unusual that is? Texas didn’t go to the trial courts, it just went straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and said, We need you to throw out the election results in four states. This is unheard of. Mike Johnson, who is now the speaker of the House but was at that point a back-bencher, organized 126 Republican members of Congress to sign onto that brief as an amicus. That became a major pivot point, because it was as much a political organizing as it was a legal organizing, and it winds up building up to House Republicans trying to refuse to certify the election Jan. 6, and then the violence and the insurrection we saw on Jan. 6.

That was the progression in 2020. As we look today, we’re seeing the beginnings of the same progression: Donald Trump, first attacking voting, his Department of Justice bringing litigation, which they are losing. Now you see the seizing of ballots in Georgia, and you start to see the rhetoric from Steve Bannon about surrounding the polls. This is the progression that Trump goes through, and I think everyone needs to be really worried.

You just mentioned the FBI search of a warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia, last week, which followed persistent demands from the president, claiming without evidence that fraud cost him Georgia. They used the opportunity to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documents, all in the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who was on the scene for that raid. Can you explain why it’s a big deal, having the DNI present for an FBI raid in Georgia?

Yes, and there’s another fact that has been way too much overlooked: The prosecutor who sought this search warrant is in Missouri; this was not out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia. From reporting, it appears this U.S. attorney out of a district in Missouri has jurisdiction not only over the 2020 Fulton County matter (to the extent that it is a matter), but also some kind of nationwide jurisdiction over all election “things.”

When you take in his involvement and you take in Gabbard’s involvement, I think you need to recast this as not simply election nihilism about 2020, and not only as a fight about nostalgia—which would still be terrible, unprecedented, and dangerous—but that would be one thing. I think this raid is about proof of concept for the future. People are talking about seizing ballots and surrounding polling places and stealing elections as if somehow these things are easily done. These are conceptual frameworks that people in the administration have to get comfortable with; these are moral frameworks they have to get comfortable with. They have to contend with the Constitution and the law and judges and all that, but they also have to contend with just the sheer logistics of it all: How do we actually do this thing where there are ballots in the possession of a county official? And how are we going to get them, and how are we going to then count them in a way that is going to cast doubt on the outcome, or cast doubt on the outcome through other propaganda and disinformation campaigns? This Georgia raid is just as much about all that as it is about 2020.

Donald Trump and his administration actually managed to pull something off here. They actually did seize ballots, they actually got their hands on them. People can say “Oh, they had the wrong warrant and they had to go back,” but at the end of the day, Tulsi Gabbard was on a truck full of documents seized from an office, and those are now in the possession of the FBI and presumably a grand jury by this prosecutor from Missouri. That should be terrifying. In terms of alarm bells, this is off the charts. They faced a challenge in 2020 and were humiliated in how to subvert the outcome of an election, and Donald Trump told the New York Times that he wished he had seized the ballots in 2020. They have now shown they have a proof of concept, that they know logistically how to do this—including getting a federal magistrate judge to sign a warrant. That is not a small matter, that is a safeguard put in place to prevent the abuse of grand juries, the abuse of subpoenas, and the abuse of arrest warrants. They got through that process, and that is a learning exercise that they will use going forward to 2026, and it is the thing that I probably worry the most about.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/eu_drone_action_plan/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission wants to see stronger EU-wide cooperation over malicious drones via a new action plan. Proposals include a central counter-drone test facility, changing the current rules governing civilian use, and a development boost to Europe&#39;s own drones and counter-drone systems.

While EU countries suffer nothing like the constant drone attacks that Russia mounts against Ukraine, they are a stark reminder of the danger. Last year, drone incursions caused airport shutdowns in Oslo and Copenhagen, and it was suspected these came from Russia-owned ships passing through the strait between the two countries.

In response, the EC is unveiling its EU Action Plan aimed at countering the increasing threat to EU states from remotely operated aircraft.

This is described as an ambitious blueprint for stronger EU cooperation and solidarity, aimed at boosting detection capability, coordinating responses, and strengthening the region&#39;s defense readiness.

The EC&#39;s report notes that drones are evolving rapidly, with advances in speed, range, and payload, plus other aspects such as resistance to electronic countermeasures. Anti-drone systems must therefore keep pace with these developments.

The Commission proposes a new framework to boost development and production of drones and counter-drone systems. It says it will work with member states to define priorities regarding technologies and capacities to inform investment.

It also calls for new approaches to testing to move solutions from the lab to deployment faster. The EU will aim to build a network of multinational testing and expertise centers for drones across member states, and asks the latter to remove any obstacles that might prevent drone and counter-drone technologies being tested in specifically designated areas.

But perhaps most importantly, building these systems at scale will be key. The Commission says it aims to expand industry engagement by convening a drone and counter-drone Industrial Forum, building on the Drone Alliance initiative with Ukraine.

It also says it will assess the possibility of co-opting the forthcoming Industrial Accelerator Act, due for proposal later this month, and the European Defence Industry Programme to boost EU production of drone and counter-drone kit.

Existing rules on civilian use will be adapted to reflect new security realities, according to the EC. These will be addressed via a proposed Drone Security Package that will extend registration and identification requirements to all drones above 100 g (about 4 oz). It hopes to have this ready for approval by Q3 2026.

It will also support a more active implementation of U-space services, a European digital system developed to manage safe access to airspace for remotely operated systems. The EC also envisions an &quot;EU Trusted Drone&quot; scheme to identify secure equipment on the market.

The EU says it has already put in place a Critical Entities Resilience (CER) Directive, requiring member nations to have a national resilience strategy and conduct risk assessments on disruptive incidents. Now it wants to go further and is proposing stress tests to gauge the resilience of critical infrastructure against drone intrusion – if countries are willing, of course.

As for detecting and tracking drones, the EC says that Europe needs better situational awareness. This will mean integrating relevant data from existing sources into a single view. Based on frameworks such as U-space, it ought to be possible to establish systems to detect, track, and identify in near real time all legitimate drones.

The region&#39;s telecoms networks can also play a part, detecting 5G-connected drones by identifying unusual SIM card identities, types of data transmission or activities, the report states. Networks should provide alerts on fast-moving assets, perhaps using AI-based automated detection and alert systems. However, this method of detection would rely on a strong partnership between national authorities,and telecoms operators, the EC says.

But 5G networks can also detect non-connected drones by using cell stations as if they were radar sensors, able to locate flying objects, including balloons, it claims. In the short term, this could be deployed to monitor certain locations such as critical infrastructure, but in the long term, it could complement existing military aerial surveillance systems.

The EC also wants to see broader cooperation between civilian and military bodies to counter drone threats. But it concedes that protecting facilities such as airports, seaports, and energy infrastructure from low-cost drones cannot rely on the military alone.

This will require relevant procedures and lines of communication to be established between all the actors, including at EU level, and to test this, it wants to see a yearly EU-level counter-drone exercise involving both civilian and military responses.

The Commission says it is also taking forward the European Drone Defence Initiative, which aims to build out capability and industrial efforts at EU level. This work will draw on Ukraine&#39;s battlefield experience in areas of data management systems, including command and control, detection systems, and effector systems (the countermeasures).

&quot;Drone and anti-drone capabilities are central components in defending Europe and securing critical infrastructure,&quot; commented the Commission EVP for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, Henna Virkkunen.

&quot;Today, we are taking a major step toward enhancing security and developing these capabilities together with our member states. In the current geopolitical context, Europe must cultivate home-grown solutions to enhance its collective security. We have the talents, the technologies, and the industrial strength to protect our assets.&quot;

With the EU Action Plan unveiled, the Commission will enter discussions with EU member states on the proposed actions, which it says should be seen as a dynamic process likely to be adapted to changing circumstances and threats. ®

            <h2>How Microsoft's legal eagles wrangled Happy Days for Windows 95</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/chen_weezer_happy_days_windows/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft&#39;s Raymond Chen has revealed an unexpected use for the company&#39;s lawyers: securing permission from the cast of Happy Days so a Weezer music video could ship on the Windows 95 CD.

The video in question was to demonstrate the multimedia capabilities of Microsoft&#39;s successor to the Windows 3.x era. As well as all that 32-bit goodness, the operating system could play back a small, grainy video, and Microsoft included some music videos to emphasize the point.

One was Edie Brickell&#39;s &quot;Good Times&quot; and another was &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; from Weezer&#39;s debut album. Both tracks were recent, and Chen recalled the steps Microsoft had to take to get the latter in front of Windows 95 customers.

&quot;First, Microsoft had to secure the rights to the song itself, which was negotiated directly with Weezer&#39;s publisher Geffen Records, and apparently without the knowledge of the band members themselves,&quot; Chen wrote on his Old New Thing blog.

The band later said the initial disquiet they felt about their music appearing on Windows 95 was offset by the exposure from the operating system&#39;s huge sales.

However, that only accounted for the audio. The video, which took place in a recreation of the Happy Days television show, was a different matter. Happy Days was set in the late 1950s and early 1960s and broadcast during the 1970s and 1980s.

This presented Microsoft&#39;s lawyers with a problem. Since clips from the show had been spliced into the video, Microsoft had to get permission from the actors featured. Chen didn&#39;t recall if the lawyer in question had to talk to the actors directly, &quot;but I can imagine it being an interesting experience trying to find Henry Winkler&#39;s telephone number (or his agent&#39;s telephone number) with a chance of talking to The Fonz himself.&quot;

Happy Days was responsible for the phrase &quot;jumping the shark,&quot; from an episode in which the Fonzie character, on waterskis, jumped over a shark. It was subsequently used to describe a show or concept that has run out of ideas and resorts to increasingly implausible plot devices.

In other news, Microsoft has continued to load its product lines with AI features, and its flagship operating system, Windows (which has suffered a terrible start to the year with multiple out-of-band fixes), is set to become an agentic OS. ®

            <h2>Doctors told to give Palantir's NHS data platform the cold shoulder</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/bma_palantir_nhs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">British doctors are being urged to pull back from the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP) after their union called on members to stop non-clinical use of the Palantir-built system.

The British Medical Association&#39;s (BMA) recommendation follows the US spy-tech firm&#39;s recent work with US Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE). The union cited allegations that ICE used Palantir&#39;s bespoke Immigration OS platform to process and link formerly separate datasets, including medical records.

Tom Dolphin, BMA chair of council, wrote in a letter to the British Medical Journal (BMJ), a publication owned by the union: &quot;It is the view of the BMA that doctors working in the NHS can no longer provide the tacit endorsement that using a product implies and must immediately take steps to explore refusing any non-direct care usage of Palantir&#39;s Federated Data Platform, with a view to moving away from the platform entirely in time, when a suitable alternative can be put in place.&quot;

A Palantir spokesperson told The Register: &quot;Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering more NHS operations, helping Royal Navy ships to stay at sea for longer, and helping the police to tackle domestic violence.&quot;

Palantir won £60 million in non-competitive pandemic contracts, starting with an initial £1 agreement. The US vendor later secured a £330 million competitive tender to provide the FDP, which NHS England – the world&#39;s largest healthcare provider – said would be core to clearing its pandemic backlog.

Critics argued that allowing Palantir to carry over technical use cases from its COVID-era platform to the FDP may have skewed the competition. NHS England said the tender was fair and open.

The BMA represents more than 200,000 doctors in the UK and negotiates their pay and conditions with the government.

In his letter to the BMJ, Dolphin said: &quot;While Palantir&#39;s involvement supporting the work of ICE is nothing new, the doctrine and scale of ICE&#39;s role in the United States appears to have shifted dramatically over the past year with violence and deaths seen across the US. Given Palantir&#39;s increasing centrality to our NHS, we must pay attention to the role Palantir plays in facilitating ICE&#39;s activities and the implications this has for patient confidence in an NHS working in partnership with them.&quot;

&quot;Where the NHS uses technology suppliers to manage patient data, it is essential that patients are able to trust that their data is safe and that the NHS remains in control.&quot;

&quot;If patients no longer feel able to trust the NHS to handle their data confidentially or worry that the personal information they share with their doctor will be used for purposes which they do not expect, this will undermine public trust in a confidential health service. This will affect patients&#39; willingness to seek care or their willingness to be candid with their doctor – which would be to the detriment of the safety and effectiveness of their treatment and to public health more generally.&quot;

In a later interview with the BMJ, the BMA chief said: &quot;Given Palantir&#39;s track record, including controversies in the US involving immigration enforcement and the risks to patient trust, data security, and NHS independence, we believe there must be a complete break from Palantir technologies in the NHS and no further contracts awarded.&quot;

The Register has asked NHS England for comment. The soon-to-be-defunct quango previously said no company involved in the FDP would be able to access health and care data without the explicit permission of the NHS. All data within the platform is under the control of the NHS and will only be used for direct care and planning.

In 2023, an NHS England official likened patient data in the FDP to information in an online Microsoft Word document. They told The Register that the cloud operator has access to that document, but the user would not expect Microsoft to look at it. ®

            <div id="article-text">Exclusive When fraudsters go after people&#39;s paychecks, &quot;every employee on earth becomes a target,&quot; according to Binary Defense security sleuth John Dwyer.

In December 2025, managed detection and response outfit Binary Defense&#39;s threat research group ARC Labs investigated a security incident in which a thief redirected a physician&#39;s salary into their own account using a very simple attack that started with a help-desk call.

&quot;This was a combination of exploiting people and processes rather than technology,&quot; Dwyer, the deputy CTO and head of Arc Labs, told The Register in an exclusive interview. &quot;It&#39;s technology-adjacent. This was identity theft from pure-play social engineering into exploiting a weaker-than-advised process internally to gain access.&quot;

The attacker used compromised credentials belonging to a shared mailbox at a healthcare facility. Binary Defenses’ incident responders can&#39;t say for certain how the attacker obtained the credentials. Dwyer said his team found no evidence of phishing and assumes the miscreant obtained the email login info from an earlier breach.

Once the attackers gained access to the mailbox, they snooped around and determined whose identity to assume when calling the help desk to request a password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) reset.

In this case, the attacker pretended to be a physician locked out of their account and thus unable to treat patients.

&quot;The call basically went that this person can&#39;t log into their account, they have patients they need to see right now, they need to get immediate access,&quot; Dwyer said. The fake physician&#39;s name and access-level checked out, so the help desk employee reset the password and MFA token. This gave the attacker access to the account, which enabled the rest of the payroll scam to play out.

It&#39;s technology-adjacent. This was identity theft from pure-play social engineering into exploiting a weaker-than-advised process internally to gain access

&quot;And this is where things get very, very interesting,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;Over the last year where we&#39;ve seen these sort of incidents, it has followed traditional business email compromise attack flows.&quot;

In one such attack targeting university employees and documented by Microsoft, the digital thieves compromised employee accounts to gain access to HR platforms like Workday and then diverted employees&#39; direct-deposit paychecks. The attackers gained initial access through phishing emails, stole MFA codes via an adversary-in-the-middle phishing link, and then accessed the victims&#39; Microsoft Exchange Online inboxes before hijacking their Workday profiles and sending paychecks to attacker-controlled accounts.

&quot;Everything happens through that access, through that mailbox in that Microsoft account,&quot; Dwyer said, adding that the attack targeting the physician looked different. After &quot;recovering&quot; the medico’s identity from the help desk social engineering call, the attacker authenticated from the healthcare organization&#39;s own virtual desktop infrastructure, registered new authentication devices to the account, and logged into the Workday payroll system.

Once they had logged into Workday, the crook changed the banking and direct deposit details to re-route the physician&#39;s paycheck into an attacker-controlled account.

This is about process exploitation and the hijacking of identities, which makes it extraordinarily hard to identify malicious versus normal identity behavior

Using the company&#39;s own virtual infrastructure allowed the attacker to bypass security detections because the logins appeared to be a legitimate internal user with a trusted endpoint and internal IP address.

&quot;With this one, the big thing that really stood out is that the attackers seem to be aware of the detection strategies against them,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;This attack was carried out purely outside of email and leveraging the trusted access through the VDI infrastructure. By abusing the organization&#39;s own virtual desktop infrastructure, so from a security tools point of view, everything looks normal and trusted.&quot;

The organization wasn&#39;t even aware that it had been compromised until the physician asked why they hadn’t been paid.

&quot;It isn&#39;t always about technology hacking,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;This is about process exploitation and the hijacking of identities, which makes it extraordinarily hard to identify malicious versus normal identity behavior. Identity is the new perimeter, and this is a new threat vector in which your persona needs to be treated like a privileged asset, rather than just your computer or your phone.&quot;

In addition to underscoring the security threats around using shared mailboxes, this incident shows how payroll and HR platforms should be viewed as a high-value target for attackers, Dwyer added. For defenders, this requires treating payroll information as a telemetry stream for threat detection and treating payroll changes as high-risk financial events.

&quot;The good news is we already have a model around this – lessons learned from wire fraud and pay and accounts payable fraud applies here,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;Changes that are made to direct deposit information should have to be confirmed in some mechanism, there should be a temporary holding period while it goes through some sort of fraud detection review, or something along those lines.&quot;

While organizations have the technology to do this, they don&#39;t necessarily have the processes in place to address this type of security and business risk, he added.

&quot;Organizations need to consider direct deposit as a legitimate, viable threat vector,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;If I was a business leader, I would want to get ahead of this, because I wouldn&#39;t want to get into some sort of arbitration with an employee over a lost paycheck.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple fanbois are realizing what the Creator Studio subscription means for its productivity apps, and many are unhappy with the direction of travel.

On January 13, Apple introduced the Apple Creator Studio, which it called (with typical Apple modesty) &quot;an inspiring collection of the most powerful creative apps.&quot;

From January 28, the faithful could spend $12.99 (£12.99 in the UK) per month (or $129/ £129 per year) on a suite of applications that included &quot;intelligent features and premium content for Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and later Freeform for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.&quot;

&quot;[With] Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform, Apple Creator Studio subscribers can be more expressive and productive with new premium content and intelligent features across Mac, iPad, and iPhone,&quot; Apple enthused.

Except that Keynote, Pages, and Numbers have traditionally been free with macOS. That&#39;s not changing - but users wanting premium features, many powered by Apple Intelligence or OpenAI, will need to subscribe.

Apple is now pushing upgrade ads at users, prompting complaints in the company&#39;s own forums.

One put it bluntly: &quot;Apple apps are not supposed to be an ad-laden experience. We aren&#39;t here for that.&quot;

While there is nothing new about products urging users to pay for a subscription or to upgrade (see Microsoft), it is jarring for Apple users who likely hoped the company was above such things in its productivity apps.

In 2024, when questioned about charging for AI-enhanced services in an interview with WIRED, Apple boss Tim Cook said: &quot;We never talked about charging for it. We view it sort of like multitouch, which enabled the smartphone revolution and the modern tablet.&quot;

Clearly, Apple has talked about it since then.

What&#39;s New screen in Pages asking for an upgrade

Users were also not warned that an upgrade would include nagging about a premium subscription, which has stuck in their craw.

For context, users aren&#39;t required to subscribe, but pop-ups frequently suggest they should for various features.

Still, ads in Apple&#39;s productivity suite, even for its own services, feel like a slippery slope. As one user put it: &quot;makes me worry this is a creeping approach to a macOS bloatware strategy. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">VMware appears to have secured an early procedural win in the case it brought against German industrial giant Siemens over its alleged use of unlicensed software.

The case commenced in March 2025, when VMware alleged Siemens&#39; US operations provided it with a list of software for which it wanted to arrange extended support. That list, VMware claims, included plenty of software that Siemens had not licensed. Siemens later provided an amended list of the VMware software it uses.

VMware says it tried to conduct a license audit, but Siemens wouldn&#39;t participate. Siemens was upset that VMware did not honor what it felt was a right to acquire extended product support.

Siemens also referred to its contracts with VMware that it says state any dispute between the two must be heard in German courts. But VMware pointed out that as the alleged use of unlicensed software took place in the US, American courts were the appropriate jurisdiction in which to contest the matter.

On Tuesday, Magistrate Judge Laura D. Hatcher, of the Delaware District Court, indicated she likes VMware&#39;s argument, issuing a Report and Recommendation that Siemens&#39; attempt to move the case to Germany be denied.

Reports of this sort are documents US courts use to indicate the logic and precedents likely to inform a future decision. As is often the case with these documents, this one gives both parties 14 days to file objections but limits those submissions to ten pages, a restriction intended to focus litigants on the issues raised in the report rather than exploring new arguments.

VMware therefore appears to be in a strong position to have this case heard in its preferred forum.

The virtualization giant has settled similar cases, but its dispute with UK retail giant Tesco continues.

Dell, which is a party to the matter, last month filed its own claim stating it seeks almost £14 million in damages if Tesco prevails. ®

            <div id="article-text">The community around Meta’s giant new data center in North Louisiana was hit hard by a winter storm and freezing temperatures. How will the power grid hold up once the data center is online?

The community around Meta’s giant new data center in North Louisiana was hit hard by a winter storm and freezing temperatures. How will the power grid hold up once the data center is online?

Donna Collins lives about 20 miles from where Meta’s biggest data center is being built, in a house her family has lived in for five generations. Construction has thrown the small agricultural community in North Louisiana into the spotlight as a high-profile example of how the infrastructure behind generative AI could impact nearby residents.

For Collins, this place is “a little piece of heaven.” “It’s all I’ve ever known as a home. It’s quiet. It’s rural. It is beautiful,” she says. “We can’t imagine the changes that are coming.”

The region was particularly hard-hit by the recent cold snap that knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of Americans. Frigid temperatures raise electricity rates — as well as questions about how ready power grids will be for future disasters while straining under growing pressure from data centers. Louisiana has built back time and again from storm after storm, but now community members and advocates want assurances that energy-hungry data centers won’t add to the costs.

“We can’t imagine the changes that are coming.”

“We’re very nervous,” Collins says. “When the wind blows, electricity goes out here in a lot of these remote areas. We live in an area where electricity is kind of uncertain as is.”

The recent “icepocalypse,” as Collins described, arrived with a January 24th winter storm. The storm was only the start — forecasters had warned that persistent freezing temperatures would allow ice to build up on trees and energy infrastructure across a large part of the US east of the Rockies. The weight of that ice can bring power lines crashing down or snarl them with falling branches.

By February 5th, local utility Entergy Louisiana said that it had finished restoring power to almost 130,000 customers affected. Collins says her home, which is served by an electric cooperative, lost power for four days. She also owns a property she uses as an Airbnb, served by Entergy, which lost power for a few days.

Meta might be Entergy’s most controversial new customer in the area. The utility is building three new gas plants to supply enough electricity for Meta’s $27 billion AI data center in Richland Parish. The facility is expected to use three times as much electricity annually as the city of New Orleans. Meta’s data center and two of the gas plants are under construction, with the data center slated to be completed in 2030. It’s too soon for them to have had an impact on the power grid during this storm.

But consumer advocates are concerned about whether residents could get stuck with higher bills as a result of rising electricity demand and new infrastructure being built for Meta, and they are already pushing for stronger protections. Gas prices spiked as wells froze up while the cold snap increased demand for the fuel used in heating and electricity. In the coming months, those increased costs are likely to show up on residents’s utility bills. Advocates are worried that the price spike could be even higher as more energy-hungry data centers used for generative AI connect to the grid.

“In a world where those three new gas power plants [serving Meta] are online, that would be further upward pressure on the cost of gas and therefore on the cost of both home heating and the cost of electricity on the larger market,” Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy (AAE), tells The Verge.

Entergy didn’t respond to requests for comment. In a statement to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle said, “We worked closely with Entergy to provide additional protection for customers, which projects that the electricity payments for the Richland Parish Data Center will cut both grid upgrade customer costs and storm charges by about 10%, resulting in $650 million in customer savings over 15 years.”

But while Meta has agreed to pay for 15 years of the capital costs of the three new power plants, Burke says that’s an incomplete picture. There are more costs associated with upgrading transmission lines, for example, and Burke is still concerned about increased demand for gas and electricity raising utility bills for other customers.

Earlier this month, Burke’s organization and the Union of Concerned Scientists also filed a response to a grid stability analysis Entergy conducted, alleging it “fails to adequately assess the reliability risks of serving the data center.” Specifically, they’re calling on the utility to redo the analysis to more thoroughly assess what would happen to the grid if there were to be a large disturbance like a transmission line or power plant going down, as the state has already seen happen during major storms.

“People in North Louisiana are already facing a lot of outages, and there’s this new [project] that is being rushed through the process, not adequately studied in terms of impact on the grid,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It could potentially cause even more disruptions and cause even more harm if we don’t take this seriously enough.”

Across the US, local opposition to other data center projects — often driven by concerns about how much electricity and water they would use — have led to delays and cancellations. In North Louisiana, Collins says residents are worried about property costs, taxes, and rents going up, too.

Meta’s moving into a community where the landscape has been defined by farmland for generations. Collins hopes the company follows through on pledges to support local vocational training and hiring as local farmers find it harder to make a living. She has a nephew who’s a farmer who now works at the Meta construction site.“I’m not against progress,” she says. “But, you know… those of us that have lived here our whole lives have to be concerned about our water supply, our electricity cost, our property values and taxes. All of those are big concerns because we’re going to pay the price.”

            <div id="article-text">The popular anti-algorithm iPhone camera app benefits from some modern updates.

The popular anti-algorithm iPhone camera app benefits from some modern updates.

Something happens every time I try to use an iPhone camera like a real camera.

Here’s how it goes: I shoot RAW in addition to the default HEIC output, and since I have the RAW file I might as well edit it to my taste. And if I’m going to do that, I want to use Lightroom on my MacBook. You know, real software. Then I remember: iPhone photos hate real software. Moving image files between devices is mysterious. If I Airdrop them to my Macbook will the HDR gain map tag along? Why do my photos always come out of Lightroom looking different than my edit? Where did that gain map go? I lack the patience to find out, so I just live with what my phone camera produces on its own and leave the heavy lifting to my “real” camera.

This has its pros and cons. On the plus side, it’s way easier to deal with iPhone photos if they never leave the native camera app. But it also means leaving processing up to the iPhone, which tends to run amok with sharpening and raising shadows. I lean on the app’s built-in Photographic Styles (shout out to Rich Contrast, you’re a real one) to avoid this, but lots of people look to third party options like Halide’s Process Zero.

Halide introduced this mode to its popular iPhone camera app last year. Process Zero promises to strip away the excess processing the native camera pipeline applies to images, resulting in photos with deeper shadows and less aggressive sharpening. Sounds great if you’re sick of the processed-to-death phone camera look!

But I’ll admit to being a bit of a Process Zero skeptic. I lived through the pre-computational-photography era of crappy phone cameras, and I generally prefer the lower noise and usable low light photos you get with current camera tech. With a higher contrast photo style applied, it gets me close enough to the look I like, even if it feels like I’m taking pictures with a computer and not so much a camera. But Halide just released the second version of Process Zero in beta, adding a couple of features that got me interested: HDR support, and the ability to shoot in Apple’s RAW format.

If those sound antithetical to Process Zero’s whole deal, well, maybe they are. And if we’re being technical about it, there was already some processing going on in Process Zero — there’s no other way to turn a bunch of sensor data into a usable image. But here’s what I appreciate about version two’s upgrades. First of all, adding HDR support doesn’t mean it’s going to turn your photo into a Thomas Kinkade painting. It means that the brightest areas of your photo can be brighter, creating a greater contrast between light and dark areas of the image. It’s the exact opposite of the flat, HDR-ish look that phone cameras often produce to try and represent a wide range of tones for an SDR screen. Don’t take my word for it; listen to Marc Levoy, who pioneered computational photography on smartphones.

There’s also the option to shoot HEIC + RAW, meaning that in addition to the Process Zero image, you’ll have a DNG file that has been through some of Apple’s computational pipeline. Apple’s ProRAW format combines multiple frames to reduce noise, but retains all of the extra data you’d expect a RAW file to contain so you can apply your preferred tone mapping. You can turn this additional RAW capture on or off, and it doesn’t affect the Process Zero output, so you can treat it like a failsafe if you don’t like the default image.

Whether or not you shoot RAW, you’ll have an option to adjust tone mapping within the Halide app through a new feature called Tone Fusion. It essentially boosts shadows, but it’s in your control and it’s not as intense as Apple’s tendencies. Even when I crank it all the way up, it doesn’t try to shift a blown-out sky blue the way the native iPhone processing does, and I appreciate that.

I think an underrated benefit of Process Zero, or Adobe’s Project Indigo, is what it does for your mindset as you take photos. Sure, you could achieve the same kind of look by shooting with ProRAW in the native camera app, taking the photo into Lightroom, and adjusting contrast to your liking. But Process Zero provides appealing results straight out of the camera; it feels different knowing you’re going to get something you like right away, rather than a file you have to fight with first.

I also feel like it gives me permission to think of myself as a photographer for a little while, not just a person with a phone. I went on a little photo walk in Seattle’s Pioneer Square and International District neighborhoods, which I’ve done dozens of times over the past decade. Outside Union Station — an old train station-turned-transit-agency-headquarters — I noticed a sign I’d never seen before, noting that the building’s great hall was open to the public. I’m not sure I would have bothered if I was just out wandering around, but with a specialized camera app on my phone I felt more like I was out doing photography, so I went in. It’s stunning, as it turns out, and I don’t know how I went over a decade living in this city without setting foot inside.

And you know what? I do like the photos I got in there with Process Zero. Shooting with a ProRAW file in my back pocket, I knew I’d have something to work with if I didn’t like the default. But I haven’t touched those files, because the JPEGs are great. There was some late afternoon sun illuminating the station’s massive windows; rather than trying to bring those highlights down and boost every shadow, Process Zero lets the bright spots clip and keeps the emphasis on the interior. The HDR gain map lets the brightest parts of the scene pop, creating contrast between the fully illuminated windows and the slightly-less-bright golden sunlight filtering in against the wall. HDR is good, y’all.

Process Zero v2 is part of a public preview of Halide’s larger Mark III update, so things might change before it’s finalized. But I like what I’m seeing, especially for Process Zero. The computational photography era has offered us a lot more than some over-processed JPEGs — the fact that we can take decent photos in basically any light conditions with the tiny sensors on our phones is nothing short of a technological triumph. Updating Process Zero to incorporate some of those benefits, if and when you want them, doesn’t detract from the minimalist experience; it’s an enhancement. And it’s enough to convert a skeptic like me.

            <div id="article-text">The Pokémon Company, Koei Tecmo, and Game Freak’s new life sim game is more than a charming spin on Animal Crossing.

The Pokémon Company, Koei Tecmo, and Game Freak’s new life sim game is more than a charming spin on Animal Crossing.

Though catching monsters and making them fight have always been core elements of the Pokémon brand, spinoffs like the Pokémon Snap and Detective Pikachu series have stood out by approaching the franchise from different angles. In different (and often small) ways, recent mainline Pokémon titles like Sword / Shield, Scarlet / Violet, and Legends: Z-A have acknowledged that there are some players who would much rather spend their time hanging out and taking pictures with their monster friends.

That leisurely approach to enjoying the Pokémon world doesn’t exactly gel with the main games’ focus on becoming a competitive champion, but it is exactly the sort of mindset you should have when you start playing Pokémon Pokopia for the Nintendo Switch 2. Co-developed by The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, and Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force division, Pokopia feels like Nintendo taking another stab at everything that makes Animal Crossing so enjoyable while experimenting with features from other crafting-forward games, like Minecraft.

Pokopia uses conventions from the core Pokémon series to make its spin on classic life simulation game mechanics like building and nurturing relationships feel distinct. It’s a fun, cute game that plays just differently enough from Animal Crossing to say that Pokopia isn’t simply a Pokémon-themed New Horizons. But what delighted me most when I recently spent some hands-on time with the game was how — when you look past its bright, island-y vibes — Pokopia’s story seems to be teasing something dark and ominous about the Pokémon world.

In Pokopia, you play as an unusual Ditto that has somehow ended up on an island after getting separated from its trainer. This Ditto isn’t great at transforming into other pokémon, and it doesn’t remember what happened to its partner. But after finding its lost trainer’s pokédex, the Ditto uses its powers to assume their form (the game’s character customization options are surprisingly robust), and it starts to explore the land around it.

When I first started playing, I knew that Pokopia was focused on a Ditto in human drag making friends with other pokémon, like Professor Tangrowth, and creating unique habitats to attract more monsters. But I was surprised and intrigued when the grass-type professor explained that it hadn’t seen another living human or pokémon out in “the desolate world” for a very long time.

After teasing me with the mystery of what happened to everyone, Pokopia dropped me right into a simple bit of gameplay involving a dehydrated Squirtle that covered the basics of how things work on the island. By meeting certain pokémon with special moves like Water Gun, Ditto can copy them and use their powers to affect terrain in the game. When selected, each move — which can only be used a certain number of times before you have to eat to recharge your Power Points — displays a grid of squares letting you know the areas it will affect when used.

Hitting patches of dried-up grass with Water Gun turned them vibrant green, and when I’d created enough connected grass squares, they sparkled to let me know that I had created a patch of Tall Grass. In Pokopia, your Pokédex registers pokémon and areas like Tall Grass as different kinds of habitats where specific monsters might show up. A timid but friendly Charmander popped out of my first patch of Tall Grass, and its powers were exactly what I needed to start a campfire. The deeper you get into Pokopia, the more complex creating new habitats becomes.

Some pokémon would only spawn if I created patches of grass shaded by large boulders, while others required me to cultivate fertile ground with wheelbarrows nearby. I had to have already met certain pokémon in order to use the moves necessary to create the conditions that would attract new monsters. And it wasn’t always guaranteed that the exact pokémon I wanted would spawn when their habitat requirements were met.

The more pokémon you befriend on the island, the more Pokopia begins to open up in terms of space that you can explore and things you can build using Animal Crossing-style recipes and workbenches. I could easily imagine myself spending hours just making places for wild pokémon to relax, but Pokopia is also clearly a game that’s aimed at builders. With the right moves and transformations, you can start doing heavy construction to reshape your island’s geography or travel to other nearby landmasses. Full-on island overhauls might take a while to complete if you’re working by yourself, but the work can go much faster when you’re using Pokopia’s multiplayer mode.

During my demo run, my groupmates and I didn’t spend much time trying to complete the objective we were encouraged to focus on as a team because it was much more fun to run around transforming into Dragonites and flying through the air. But if we had been a little more goal-oriented, we could have built some buildings or snapped a few group photos with our conspicuously retro Pokédexes.

Aside from the foreshadowed desolation, what struck me most about Pokopia was how relaxing its interpolations of classic Pokémon songs were and how expressive the game’s monster animations are. Though the game isn’t voice acted, pokémon’s faces charmingly convey the emotions they’re feeling — sometimes they’re excited to talk to you, sometimes they’re in a bad mood and need cheering up — as you visit them in their new homes. And while I wasn’t able to get a look at just how many pokémon can be befriended in the game, it was clear that a sizable number of them can make appearances on the island.

Even though it’s clearly aimed at kids, Pokopia feels like the kind of game that’s going to be just as enjoyable for adult Pokémon fans when it hits the Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5th. And if the game’s deeper story is anywhere nearly as dark as it seems, it might be one of the franchise’s most fascinating side stories yet.

Hundreds of flights will be affected by the FAA’s sudden announcement.

The Federal Aviation Administration has closed the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas, grounding all flights in and out of the airport for the next 10 days. No explanation for the closure has been given, beyond a vague reference to “Special Security Reasons.”

The closure was announced late on February 10th in a notice on the FAA website, and applies until February 20th. A second notice lists a similar closure for nearby Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Airspace in a 10-mile radius around El Paso airport is included, though flights above 18,000 feet are unaffected, as is Mexican airspace.

El Paso operates flights from major US airlines including Southwest, Delta, United, and American. The New York Times reports that Southwest will be most affected by the closure, with 480 flights scheduled through the 10-day period. An unnamed spokesperson for the airport told the Times that the closure was issued “on short notice,” and in a social media post has told travelers to contact their airlines for more information.

“From what my office and I have been able to gather overnight and early this morning, there is no immediate threat to the community or surrounding areas,” El Paso congresswoman Veronica Escobar said in a series of posts on X. “There was no advance notice provided to my office, the City of El Paso, or anyone involved in airport operations. We have urged the F.A.A. to lift the Temporary Flight Restrictions placed on the El Paso area.”

﻿Live Translation will be available to beta testers ‘this Spring.’

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

T-Mobile is preparing to test a new AI feature that translates live phone calls into more than 50 languages. Live Translation is launching in beta “this Spring,” according to a press release, with registration for eligible T-Mobile customers available starting today.

“Some of the biggest barriers wireless customers face are the simplest ones — like being able to understand each other,” said T-Mobile CEO Srini Gopalan. “By bringing real-time AI directly into our network, we’re delivering more than connectivity — turning conversations into community, starting with Live Translation.”

Enabling it at the network level means users don’t need specific apps or devices to use the service. The only requirement is that translation must be initiated by a T-Mobile network user. The feature will be available on the carrier’s 5G Advanced network, but T-Mobile President of Technology and CTO John Saw told The Verge that Live Translation works over both 4G LTE and 5G:

“The key requirement is a Voice over LTE (VoLTE) connection, which allows the service to operate reliably across a wide range of devices and network conditions,” said Saw. “That flexibility is important because it ensures Live Translation works for customers wherever they are, not just when they’re on the latest network technology. Live Translation works over VoLTE, VoNR, and VoWiFi.”

T-Mobile says that beta participants can activate Live Translation “for as long as they need” by dialing 87, at no additional cost during the beta period. T-Mobile has not mentioned if Live Translation will be paywalled when it launches to the general public this year. Beta participants will also be able to activate Live Translation by saying “Hey T-Mobile” later this spring.

It’s worth flagging that the feature only works during an active call, and that T-Mobile won’t save call recordings or transcripts. “The service is designed to translate conversations in real time and then move on, without storing the content of those calls,” Saw said.

The new feature works with text or image prompts, but double-check your order before putting it through.

Uber announced a new AI feature called “Cart Assistant” for grocery shopping in its Uber Eats app.

The new feature works a couple different ways. You can use text prompts, as you would with any other AI chatbot, to ask it to build a grocery list for you. Or you can upload a picture of your shopping list and ask it to populate your cart with all your favorite items, based on your order history. You can be as generic as you — “milk, eggs, cereal” — and the bot will make a list with all your preferred brands.

And that’s just to start out. Uber says in the coming months, Cart Assistant will add more features, including “full recipe inspiration, meal plans, and the ability to ask follow up questions, and expand to retail partners.”

But like all chatbots, Uber acknowledges that Cart Assistant may make mistakes, and urges users to double-check and confirm the results before placing any orders.

It will also only work at certain grocery stores, with Uber announcing interoperability at launch with Albertsons, Aldi, CVS, Kroger, Safeway, Sprouts, Safeway, Walgreen, and Wegmans. More stores will be added in the future, the company says.

Uber has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate Uber Eats into its own suite of apps. But Uber spokesperson Richard Foord declined to say whether the AI company’s technology was powering the new chatbot in Uber Eats. “Cart Assistant draws on publicly available LLM models as well as Uber’s own AI stack,” Foord said in an email.

Uber has been racing to add more AI-driven features to its apps, including robotaxis with Waymo and sidewalk delivery robots in several cities. The company also recently revived its AI Labs to collaborate with its partners on building better products using delivery and customer data.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How next-generation nuclear reactors break out of the 20th-century blueprint

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste.The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI is changing gymnastics judgingThe 2023 World Championships last October marked the first time an AI judging system was used on every apparatus in a gymnastics competition. There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics. The question now is whether it really makes it fairer. Read the full story.

Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.

There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.

But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in Nature Energy.

“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.

The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.

EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.

For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)

Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.

One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.

Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.

In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.

The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.

Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.

Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.

For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

As of December 2025, ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to The Information. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.

“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”

MIT Technology Review reached out to three employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.

Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of The Prof G Pod. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.

“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”

Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.

QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.

QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”

“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told MIT Technology Review. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.

The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.

Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.

“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

Making AI Work, MIT Technology Review’s new AI newsletter, is here

For years, our newsroom has explored AI’s limitations and potential dangers, as well as its growing energy needs. And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as coding and running scientific experiments.But how is AI actually being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work? These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter. Read more about it, and sign up here to receive the seven editions straight to your inbox.

“There is no Plan B, because that assumes you will fail. We’re going to do the start-up thing until we die.”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Databricks is having one of those years that most enterprise software companies would quietly envy. The data and AI platform says it has reached a $5.4bn annual revenue run rate, growing 65% year over year, at a time when growth across the sector has cooled noticeably.

For a private company, that pace is rare. And it helps explain why investors have continued to pour money into Databricks, even as funding has become more selective.

The company says it has now raised more than $7bn in total capital, including recent equity funding that values the business at $134bn, alongside a large debt facility to support long-term expansion.

What’s driving the numbers isn’t just classic data analytics. Databricks says around $1.4bn of its revenue run rate now comes from AI-related products, reflecting how quickly companies are trying to turn large datasets into something usable for machine learning and generative AI. Instead of building separate stacks for data and AI, many customers are opting for platforms that combine both.

In practice, that means Databricks is leaning into tools that make complex data systems easier to use. Products like Genie, which lets people query data using plain language, and Lakebase, a new operational database designed for AI-driven applications, are meant to lower the barrier between raw data and real-world use.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

While Databricks is still private, its scale increasingly puts it in the same conversation as public cloud giants.

“We’re seeing overwhelming investor interest in our next chapter as we go after two new markets,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “With this new capital, we’ll double down on Lakebase so developers can create operational databases built for AI agents. At the same time, we’re investing in Genie to let every employee chat with their data, driving accurate and actionable insights.

Databricks’ numbers also cut through a lot of the noise around enterprise AI. While many companies are still talking about transformation, this growth suggests businesses are already spending on the unglamorous parts, cleaning data, connecting systems, and making AI usable inside real organisations.

If that trend holds, the next phase of AI won’t be defined by new models or flashy demos, but by which platforms quietly become impossible to replace. Databricks is clearly betting it can be one of them.

            <h2>Allonic is rebuilding robotics from the inside out</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based energy software company Tem has closed a $75 million Series B round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with additional funding from AlbionVC, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Schroders Capital, Voyager Ventures, Allianz, and others.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.
