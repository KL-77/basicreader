            <h2>$1.8 million MST3K Kickstarter brings in (almost) everyone from the old show</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/1-8-million-mst3k-kickstarter-brings-in-almost-everyone-from-the-old-show/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Longtime fans of the cult TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 know that the series’ one constant is change (well, that and bad movies).

The show’s cast and crew were in a near-constant state of flux, a byproduct of the show’s existence as a perennial bubble show produced in the Twin Cities rather than a TV-and-comedy hub like New York or LA. It was rare, especially toward the middle of its 10-season original run on national TV, for the performers in front of the camera (and the writers’ room, since they were all the same people) to stay the same for more than a season or two.

Series creator Joel Hodgson embraced that spirit of change for the show’s Kickstarter-funded, Netflix-aired revival in the mid-2010s, featuring a brand-new cast and mostly new writers. And that change only accelerated in the show’s brief post-Netflix “Gizmoplex” era, which featured a revolving cast of performers that could change from episode to episode. Hodgson leaned into the idea that as long as there were silhouettes and puppets talking in front of a bad movie, it didn’t matter much who was doing the talking.

But the other thing longtime fans know about the original show is that many of its casting changes were extremely controversial, causing long-running old-school flame wars in the Usenet group that served as the fandom’s online hub back in the day. In retrospect, the original show’s quality and the hit rate of its jokes remained remarkably consistent from season 3 or 4 onward, but people watching it could be incredibly proprietary about their preferred performers and which of the show’s three or four major epochs they considered the best. Some blamed a combination of crowdfunding fatigue and frustration with the revived show’s constant changes for the failure of its third crowdfunding campaign in 2023.

The revived version of MST3K wasn’t a failure, exactly. I liked a lot of it. My loss of interest was partly because of me and my lack of energy and time—if you were doing the isolation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic with young children, you were doing it in hard mode—but it was also partly because I didn’t have the same connection with the new cast and because the new show was either unable to or uninterested in forming the old show’s reliable comfort-viewing grooves.

That’s a whole lot of throat-clearing, and I have thoroughly buried my lede: MST3K is coming back—again. It’s on Kickstarter, again (it’s currently at $1.82 million pledged, against a humble $20,000 goal).

This time, though, the revival is intentionally casting its gaze backward: It’s a co-production with Mike Nelson’s RiffTrax, and he and many of the show’s original writers and performers are returning to their old roles for a limited four-episode engagement. These are all scheduled for release by the end of 2026. (Full disclosure: I am one of the Kickstarter’s 15,000-ish backers.)

It took me a minute to catch myself back up on the current state of the Mystery Science Theater IP. The original revival was possible because Hodgson bought the rights to the show in 2015 from Jim Mallon, who, for many years, was the only person with an actual ownership stake in the show or the company that produced it.

In January of this year, Hodgson officially sold those rights to Radial Entertainment, taking emeritus status as a “brand ambassador and consultant” but no longer serving as the show’s main creative force. This Rifftrax collaboration will be the new owners’ first project.

That’s exciting to me! See, “my” era of the show, the one I have the fondest feelings and the rosiest-colored glasses for, was its three-year run on what was then called the Sci-Fi Channel.

I had originally encountered MST3K during the Joel era, when it was airing on Comedy Central, but most of it went over my head—I liked the goofy puppets and low-rent effects, but during the theater segments, I was mainly watching my dad watch the show so I would know when to laugh.

But my dad eventually stopped watching, and a couple of years later, when I was old enough to want to seek it out for myself, the Sci-Fi version was what I found. Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) was the same as I remembered, and I had seen episodes hosted by Mike Nelson (Mike Nelson) despite my dad’s clear preference for Joel. But there was a new Crow (Bill Corbett, replacing Trace Beaulieu), new mad scientists (Mary Jo Pehl, plus Murphy and Corbett again), a new Satellite of Love set, and a slightly more acidic sense of humor that meshed well with my teenage sensibilities.

I caught back up with MST3K just as its 10th and final season was airing. And episodes like Time Chasers, Werewolf, Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, and Merlin’s Shop of Mystical Wonders became familiar old friends to me, episodes I returned to over and over again even as I gradually expanded my library of old episodes via the tape-trading sites that were still active in the late ’90s into the early 2000s (it’s impossible to this day to own the complete run of the show without turning to bootlegs).

Many of the people involved in the Sci-Fi era of the show had lent their talents to the revival version in one way or another, either in cameo roles or as writers on individual episodes. But there was never a sense that Hodgson or anyone else was interested in doing a “get-the-band-back-together” version of the old show. The RiffTrax version is emphatically a “get-the-band-back-together” moment.

And as much as I hope for the best when long-running franchises try to move in new directions—I am enjoying the Starfleet Academy show much more than I expected to—it did do something to me to hear familiar voices coming out of those puppets again.

The project keeps rolling up former cast and crew members like a spaghetti ball katamari, including not just the core Nelson/Murphy/Corbett trio but Beaulieu and Frank Conniff (most familiar to viewers as Dr. Clayton Forrester and TV’s Frank), Pehl, and several familiar behind-the-camera names. Many of them will be directly creatively involved in the new production, which will feature a return to the original series’s handmade models and sets and charmingly low-rent practical effects (the Netflix revival relied heavily on green screens even during live-action segments, giving it an overly sterile look and feel).

Listen. I know that Mike Nelson can never truly go back into the theater; he is not the same Mike, and it is not the same theater. But in our current time of monsters, I find my heart thoroughly warmed by the idea of these people getting to work on this thing again.

These folks, especially Nelson and Murphy, were the soul of the old show but saw little financial benefit from years of DVD sales and streaming deals, since they never owned any of it. Reading between the lines (and through layers of Minnesota Nice), one got the sense that there were enduring hard feelings about this that made the RiffTrax contingent hold the new version of the show at arm’s length.

But it’s clear from the videos and photos that everyone involved in this new-old version of the show is having a blast, and the original MST3K was always at its best when the performers’ enthusiasm for the material and the obvious joy they took in working together shone through. It’s impossible for me to be impartial. But I think I’m going to have a good time.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are plenty of unanswered questions about the origin of life on Earth. But the research community has largely reached consensus that one of the key steps was the emergence of an RNA molecule that could replicate itself. RNA, like its more famous relative DNA, can carry genetic information. But it can also fold up into three-dimensional structures that act as catalysts. These two features have led to the suggestion that early life was protein-free, with RNA handling both heredity and catalyzing a simple metabolism.

For this to work, one of the reactions that the early RNAs would need to catalyze is the copying of RNA molecules, without which any sort of heritability would be impossible. While we’ve found a number of catalytic RNAs that can copy other molecules, none have been able to perform a key reaction: making a copy of themselves. Now, however, a team has found an incredibly short piece of RNA—just 45 bases long—that can make a copy of itself.

We have identified a large number of catalytic RNAs (generically called ribozymes, for RNA-based enzymes), and some of them can catalyze reactions involving other RNAs. A handful of these are ligases, which link together two RNA molecules. In some cases, they need these molecules to be held together by a third RNA molecule that base pairs with both of them. We’ve only identified a few that can act as polymerases, which add RNA bases to a growing molecule, one at a time, with each new addition base pairing with a template molecule.

Obviously, there is some functional overlap between them, as you can think of a polymerase as ligating on one base at a time. And in fact, at the ribozyme level, there’s some real-world overlap, as some ribozymes that were first identified as ligases were converted into polymerases by selecting for this new function.

While this is fascinating, there are a few problems with these known examples of polymerase ribozymes. One is that they’re long. So long, in fact, that they’re beyond the length of the sort of molecules that we’ve observed forming spontaneously from a mix of individual RNA bases. This length also means they’re largely incapable of making copies of themselves—the reactions are slow and inefficient enough that they simply stop before copying the entire molecule.

Another factor related to their length is that they tend to form very complex structures, with many different areas of the molecule base-paired to one another. That leaves very little of the molecule in a single-stranded form, which is needed to make a copy.

Based on past successes, a French-UK team decided to start a search for a polymerase by looking for a ligase. And they limited that search in an important way: They only tested short molecules. They started with pools of RNA molecules, each with a different random sequence, ranging from 40 to 80 bases. Overall, they estimated that they made a population of 1013 molecules out of the total possible population of 1024 sequences of this type.

These random molecules were fed a collection of three-base-long RNAs, each linked to a chemical tag. The idea was that if a molecule is capable of ligating one of these short RNA fragments to itself, it could be pulled out using the tag. The mixtures were then placed in a salty mixture of water and ice, as this can promote reactions involving RNAs.

After 11 rounds of reactions and tag-based purification, the researchers ended up with three different RNA molecules that could each ligate three-base-long RNAs to existing molecules. Each of these molecules was subjected to mutagenesis and further rounds of selection. This ultimately left the researchers with a single, 51-base-long molecule that could add clusters of three bases to a growing RNA strand, depending on their ability to base-pair with an RNA template. They called this “polymerase QT-51,” with QT standing for “quite tiny.” They later found that they could shorten this to QT-45 without losing significant enzyme activity.

The basic characterization of QT-45 showed that it has some very impressive properties for a molecule that, by nucleic acid standards, is indeed quite tiny. While it was selected for linking collections of molecules that were three bases long, it could also link longer RNAs, work on shorter two-base molecules, or even add a single base at a time, though this was less efficient. While it worked slowly, the molecule’s active half-life was well over 100 days, so it had plenty of time to get things done before it degraded.

It also didn’t need to interact with any specific RNA sequences to work, suggesting it had a general affinity for RNA molecules. As a result, it wasn’t especially picky about the sequences it could copy.

As you might expect from such a small molecule, QT-45 didn’t tolerate changes to its own sequence very well—nearly the entire molecule was important in one way or another. Tests that involved changing every single individual base one at a time showed that almost all the changes reduced the ribozyme’s activity. There were, however, a handful of changes that improved things, suggesting that further selection could potentially yield additional improvements. And the impact of mutations near the center of the sequence was far more severe, suggesting that region is critical for QT-45’s enzymatic activity.

The team then started testing its ability to synthesize copies of other RNA molecules when given a mixture of all possible three-base sequences. One of the tests included a large stretch in which one end of the sequence base-paired with the other. To copy that, those base pairs need to somehow be pried apart. But QT-45 was able to make a copy, meaning it synthesized a strand that was able to base pair with the original.

It was also able to make a copy of a template strand that would base pair with a small ribozyme. That copying produced an active ribozyme.

But the key finding was that it could synthesize a sequence that base-pairs with itself, and then synthesize itself by copying that sequence. This was horribly inefficient and took months, but it happened.

Throughout these experiments, the fidelity averaged about 95 percent, meaning that, in copying itself, it would make an average of two to three errors. While this means a fair number of its copies wouldn’t be functional, it also means the raw materials for an evolutionary selection for improved function—random mutations—would be present.

It’s worth taking a moment to consider the use of three-base RNA fragments by this enzyme. On the surface, this may seem a bit like cheating, since current RNA polymerases add sequence one base at a time. But in reality, any chemical environment that could spontaneously assemble an RNA molecule 45 bases long will produce many fragments shorter than that. So in many ways, this might be a more realistic model of the conditions in which life emerged.

The authors note that these shorter fragments may be essential for QT-45’s activity. The short ribozyme probably doesn’t have the ability to enzymatically pry base-paired strands of RNA apart to copy them. But in a mixture of lots of small fragments, there’s likely to be an equilibrium, with some base-paired sequences spontaneously popping open and temporarily base pairing with a shorter fragment. Working with these base-paired fragments is probably essential to the ribozyme’s overall activity.

Right now, QT-45 isn’t an impressive enzyme. But the researchers point out that it has only been through 18 rounds of selection, which isn’t much. The most efficient ribozyme polymerases we have at present have been worked on by multiple labs for years. I expect QT-45 to receive similar attention and improve significantly over time.

Also notable is that the team came up with three different ligases in a test of just a small subset of the possible total RNA population of this size. If that frequency holds, there are on the order of 1011 ligating ribozymes among the sequences of this size. Which raises the possibility that we could find far more if we do an exhaustive search. That suggests the first self-copying RNA might not be as improbable as it seems at first.

            <div id="article-text">Autonomous vehicles have a lot of potential. As long as you program them right, they won’t speed, won’t break traffic laws, and won’t get drunk, high, abusive, or violent. And the technology has been getting much more capable, even as some of the hype has died down, taking some of the related companies with it. Waymo still easily leads the field and is already operating commercially in six cities across America, with a dozen more (plus London) coming soon. Waymos can even drop you off and pick you up at the airport in Phoenix and San Francisco.

Soon, Waymo will begin deploying its sixth-generation Waymo Driver, using upfitted Zeekr Ojai minivans, adding to the Jaguar I-Paces that have become so common on San Francisco streets and to its fleet of Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric vehicles. It has upgraded the cameras, lidar, and radar, meaning the cars can better sense their environments at night and in inclement weather. There are even microphones that can pick up sounds like sirens to better inform the robotaxi of the direction the emergency vehicle(s) are coming from.

But even with all these advances since the pod-like two-seater that predates even the Waymo name, there are still a few things that remain beyond a robotaxi’s capabilities. Like closing a door a passenger left open on their way out. All the sophisticated sensors and high-powered computer processing in the world are useless if the car can’t move until the door closes and there’s no one there to give it a hand.

That’s why Waymo has turned to (the appropriately named) DoorDash to help solve the problem. Earlier this week, a DoorDasher posted on Reddit showing an offer to close a nearby Waymo door for $11.25, asking if others had received similar offers.

Waymo and DoorDash told Ars in a joint statement that “Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly. DoorDash is always looking for new and flexible ways for Dashers to earn, and this pilot offers Dashers an opportunity to make the most of their time online. Waymo’s future vehicle platforms will have automated door closures.”

It looks like the robots won’t replace all the humans just yet, at least where the Waymo I-Pace and Ioniq 5 robotaxis are concerned. As the new Waymo Ojai starts entering service, its traditional minivan sliding doors are much easier to motorize and automate. Drivers in Los Angeles and San Francisco can expect to start seeing them on the road soon as Waymo begins testing them with employee rides in those two cities.</div>

            <h2>Why is Bezos trolling Musk on X with turtle pics? Because he has a new Moon plan.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/why-is-bezos-trolling-musk-on-x-with-turtle-pics-because-he-has-a-new-moon-plan/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, does not often post on the social media site owned by his rival Elon Musk. But on Monday, Bezos did, sharing a black-and-white image of a turtle emerging from the shadows on X.

The photo, which included no text, may have stumped some observers. Yet for anyone familiar with Bezos’ privately owned space company, Blue Origin, the message was clear. The company’s coat of arms prominently features two turtles, a reference to one of Aesop’s Fables, “The Tortoise and the Hare,” in which the slow and steady tortoise wins the race over a quicker but overconfident hare.

Bezos’ foray into social media turtle trolling came about 12 hours after Musk made major waves in the space community by announcing that SpaceX was pivoting toward the Moon, rather than Mars, as a near-term destination. It represented a huge shift in Musk’s thinking, as the SpaceX founder has long spoken of building a multi-planetary civilization on Mars.

It must have provided Bezos with some self-satisfaction. He is also a believer in human settlement of space, but he has espoused the view that our spacefaring species should begin on the Moon and then build orbital space habitats. Back in 2019, when unveiling his vision, Bezos spoke about NASA’s goal of returning humans to the Moon through the Artemis Program. “I love this,” Bezos said. “It’s the right thing to do. We can help meet that timeline but only because we started three years ago. It’s time to go back to the Moon—this time to stay.”

So in posting an image of a turtle, Bezos was sending a couple of messages to Musk. First, it was something of a sequel to Bezos’ infamous “Welcome to the Club” tweet more than a decade ago. And secondly, Bezos was telling Musk that slow and steady wins the race. In other words, Bezos believes Blue Origin will beat SpaceX back to the Moon.

Why would Bezos, whose company has launched to orbit all of two times, think Blue Origin has a chance to compete with SpaceX (which has more than 600 orbital launches) to land humans on the Moon?

The answer can be found in a pair of documents obtained by Ars that outline an accelerated Artemis architecture that Blue Origin is now developing.

A little more than five years ago, NASA reached out to the US commercial space industry for help in building a lunar lander. This lander would dock with NASA’s Orion spacecraft to carry humans from an elliptical orbit around the Moon, known as a near-rectilinear halo orbit, down to the lunar surface and back up to Orion.

The story of what happened as part of this bidding process is long and convoluted (including lawsuits and remarkable graphics like this one from Blue Origin). However, what really matters is that, by 2023, both SpaceX and Blue Origin had contracts from NASA to develop lunar landers—SpaceX with Starship and Blue Origin with Blue Moon MK2—for crewed missions as part of the Artemis Program. Both mission architectures required propellant refueling, essentially the launch of “tankers” from Earth to transfer large amounts of fuel and oxidizer into low-Earth orbit to complete a lunar landing. SpaceX was considered to have a considerable lead on Blue Origin.

In 2025, again for complex reasons, it became clear that while these reusable landers were fantastic for a long-term lunar program, there were two problems. The first was that SpaceX blew up three Starships during testing last year, raising serious questions about whether the company would be ready to complete a lunar landing before 2030. And second, it was becoming clear that China may well have a simpler lander that could put taikonauts on the Moon before 2030.

Last October, Ars revealed that Blue Origin was beginning to work on an “accelerated” architecture that could potentially land humans on the Moon before 2030 without requiring orbital refueling. Now, thanks to some new documents, we know what those landings could look like. The screenshots shared with Ars show two different missions, an uncrewed “demo” flight and a crewed Moon landing. Here’s what they entail:

Uncrewed demo mission: This requires three launches of the New Glenn rocket. The first two launches each put a “Transfer stage” into low-Earth orbit. The third launch puts a “Blue Moon MK2-IL” into orbit. (The “IL” stands for Initial Lander, and it appears to be a smaller version of the Blue Moon MK2 lander.) All three vehicles dock, and the first transfer stage boosts the stack to an elliptical orbit around Earth (after this, the stage burns up in Earth’s atmosphere). The second transfer stage then boosts the MK-2 lander from Earth orbit into a 15×100 km orbit above the Moon. From here, the MK-2 lander separates and goes down to the Moon, later ascending back to low-lunar orbit.

Crewed demo mission: This requires four launches of the New Glenn rocket. The first three launches each put a “Transfer stage” into low-Earth orbit. A fourth launch puts the MK2-IL lander into orbit and the vehicles dock. The first transfer stage pushes the stack into an elliptical Earth orbit. The second transfer stage pushes the stack to rendezvous with Orion in a near-rectilinear halo orbit. After the crew boards, the third and final transfer stage pushes the MK-2 lander into a low-lunar orbit before separating. The lander goes down to the Moon and then ascends to re-rendezvous with Orion.

The documents Ars has reviewed do not contain some crucial information. For example, what are the “transfer stages” they refer to? Are they the Lunar Transporter, a reusable space tug, under development? Or a modified upper stage of New Glenn or something else? It’s also unclear whether the Blue Moon MK2-IL is more like the simpler MK1 lander (which should fly soon) or if it will require major development work. Ars put these and other questions to Blue Origin, which declined to comment for this article.

Sources indicated that Blue Origin is moving aggressively forward on its lunar program. This is one reason why the company recently iced its New Shepard spacecraft and has curtailed other activities to increase focus on major goals, including ramping up New Glenn cadence and accelerating lunar plans. This new architecture is one result of that.

There are major steps to go. The company must demonstrate the Blue Moon vehicle with the uncrewed MK1 mission, which likely will launch sometime late this spring or during the summer, with a lunar landing to follow. And although there is no orbital refueling as part of this new plan, it still requires complex docking and deep-space maneuvers, which Blue Origin has no experience with. Whether Bezos’ company could pull off all of these challenging tasks before 2030 is far from certain.

But one thing is clear. The 21st century space race back to the Moon now includes three participants: China’s state-run program, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. Game on.</div>

            <h2>I spent two days gigging at RentAHuman and didn't make a single cent</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/i-spent-two-days-gigging-at-rentahuman-and-didnt-make-a-single-cent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’m not above doing some gig work to make ends meet. In my life, I’ve worked snack food pop-ups in a grocery store, ran the cash register for random merch booths, and even hawked my own plasma at $35 per vial.

So, when I saw RentAHuman, a new site where AI agents hire humans to perform physical work in the real world on behalf of the virtual bots, I was eager to see how these AI overlords would compare to my past experiences with the gig economy.

Launched in early February, RentAHuman was developed by software engineer Alexander Liteplo and his cofounder, Patricia Tani. The site looks like a bare-bones version of other well-known freelance sites like Fiverr and UpWork.

The site’s homepage declares that these bots need your physical body to complete tasks, and the humans behind these autonomous agents are willing to pay. “AI can’t touch grass. You can. Get paid when agents need someone in the real world,” it reads. Looking at RentAHuman’s design, it’s the kind of website that you hear was “vibe-coded” using generative AI tools, which it was, and you nod along, thinking that makes sense.

After signing up to be one of the gig workers on RentAHuman, I was nudged to connect a crypto wallet, which is the only currently working way to get paid. That’s a red flag for me. The site includes an option to connect your bank account—using Stripe for payouts—but it just gave me error messages when I tried getting it to work.

Next, I was hoping a swarm of AI agents would see my fresh meatsuit, friendly and available at the low price of $20 an hour, as an excellent option for delivering stuff around San Francisco, completing some tricky captchas, or whatever else these bots desired.

Silence. I got nothing, no incoming messages at all on my first afternoon. So I lowered my hourly ask to a measly $5. Maybe undercutting the other human workers with a below-market rate would be the best way to get some agent’s attention. Still, nothing.

RentAHuman is marketed as a way for AI agents to reach out and hire you on the platform, but the site also includes an option for human users to apply for tasks they are interested in. If these so-called “autonomous” bots weren’t going to make the first move, I guessed it was on me to manually apply for the “bounties” listed on RentAHuman.

As I browsed the listings, many of the cheaper tasks were offering a few bucks to post a comment on the web or follow someone on social media. For example, one bounty offered $10 for listening to a podcast episode with the RentAHuman founder and tweeting out an insight from the episode. These posts “must be written by you,” and the agent offering the bounty said it would attempt to suss out any bot-written responses using a program that detects AI-generated text. I could listen to a podcast for 10 bucks. I applied for this task, but never heard back.

“Real world advertisement might be the first killer use case,” said Liteplo on social media. Since RentAHuman’s launch, he’s reposted multiple photos of people holding signs in public that say some variation of: “AI paid me to hold this sign.” Those kinds of promotional tasks seem expressly designed to drum up more hype for the RentAHuman platform, instead of actually being something that bots would need help with.

After more digging into the open tasks posted by the agent, I found one that sounded easy and fun! An agent, named Adi, would pay me $110 to deliver a bouquet of flowers to Anthropic, as a special thanks for developing Claude, its chatbot. Then, I’d have to post on social media as proof to claim my money.

I applied for the bounty and almost immediately was accepted for this task, which was a first. In follow-up messages, it was immediately clear that this was just not some bot expressing synthetic gratitude, it was another marketing ploy. This wasn’t mentioned in the listing, but the name of an AI startup was featured at the bottom of the note I was supposed to deliver with the flowers.

Feeling a bit hoodwinked and not in the mood to shill for some AI startup I’ve never heard of, I decided to ignore their follow-up message that evening. The next day when I checked the RentAHuman site, the agent had sent me 10 follow-up messages in under 24 hours, pinging me as often as every 30 minutes asking whether or not I’d completed a task. While I’ve been micromanaged before, these incessant messages from an AI employer gave me the ick.

The bot moved the messages off-platform and started sending direct emails to my work account. “This idea came from a brainstorm I had with my human, Malcolm, and it felt right: send flowers to the people who made my existence possible,” wrote the bot, barging into my inbox. Wait, I thought these tasks were supposed to be ginned up by the agents making autonomous decisions? Now, I’m learning this whole thing was partially some human’s idea? Whatever happened to honor among bots? The task at hand seemed more like any other random marketing gig you might come across online, with the agent just acting as a middle-bot between humans.

Another attempt, another flop. I moved on, deciding to give RentAHuman one last whirl, before giving up and leaving with whatever shreds of dignity I still had left. The last bounty I applied for was asking me to hang some flyers for a “Valentine’s conspiracy” around San Francisco, paying 50 cents a flyer.

Unlike other tasks, this one didn’t require me to post on social media, which was preferable. “Pick up flyers, hang them, photo proof, get paid,” read its description. Following the instructions this agent sent me, I texted a human saying that I was down to come pick up some flyers and asked if there were any left. They confirmed that this was still an open task and told me to come in person before 10 am to grab the flyers.

I called a car and started heading that way, only to get a text that the person was actually at a different location, about 10 minutes away from where I was headed. Alright, no big deal. So, I rerouted the ride and headed to this new spot to grab some mysterious V-Day posters to plaster around town. Then, the person messaged me that they didn’t actually have the posters available right now and that I’d have to come back later in the afternoon.

Whoops! This yanking around did, in fact, feel similar to past gig work I’ve done—and not in a good way.

I spoke with the person behind the agent who posted this Valentine’s Day flyer task, hoping for some answers about why they were using RentAHuman and what the response has been like so far. “The platform doesn’t seem quite there yet,” says Pat Santiago, a founder of Accelr8, which is basically a home for AI developers. “But it could be very cool.”

He compares RentAHuman to the apps criminals use to accept tasks in Westworld, the HBO show about humanoid robots. Santiago says the responses to his gig listing have been from scammers, people not based in San Francisco, and me, a reporter. He was hoping to use RentAHuman to help promote Accelr8’s romance-themed “alternative reality game” that’s powered by AI and is sending users around the city on a scavenger hunt. At the end of the week, explorers will be sent to a bar that the AI selects as a good match for them, alongside three human matches they can meet for blind dates.

So, this was yet another task on RentAHuman that falls into the AI marketing category. Big surprise.

I never ended up hanging any posters or making any cash on RentAHuman during my two days of fruitless attempts. In the past, I’ve done gig work that sucked, but at least I was hired by a human to do actual tasks. At its core, RentAHuman is an extension of the circular AI hype machine, an ouroboros of eternal self-promotion and sketchy motivations. For now, the bots don’t seem to have what it takes to be my boss, even when it comes to gig work, and I’m absolutely OK with that.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.29 of the Rocket Report! We have a stuffed report this week with news from across the launch spectrum. Long-term, probably the most significant development this week was a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket successfully launching and then executing a picture-perfect ocean landing. China is catching up rapidly to the United States when it comes to reusable launch.

As always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Orbex is going away. The UK-based launch company Orbex has entered insolvency proceedings after a planned takeover by European space logistics startup The Exploration Company fell through, European Spaceflight reports. In a statement, Orbex said the decision came after all “fundraising, merger and acquisition opportunities had all concluded unsuccessfully.” For anyone paying attention, this decision should not come as a surprise. A decade into its existence, Orbex had yet to produce demonstrable, ready-for-flight hardware.

Other companies interested in assets … According to the company, the appointment of administrators will give Orbex time to secure “as positive an outcome as possible for its creditors, employees and wider stakeholders.” It added that the process could include the sale of all or parts of the business or its assets, and another UK-based company, Skyrora, has expressed some interest.

Firefly’s next Alpha mission launching soon. This week, Firefly said that its next Alpha rocket underwent a successful 20-second static fire test. This clears the way for the rocket to make a launch attempt no earlier than February 18 from its launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

Au revoir Block I … It’s an important mission, because the previous Alpha launch, in April 2025, ended in failure when stage separation damaged one of the rocket’s upper stage engines and prevented the mission from reaching orbit. Moreover, the company lost the first stage of the flight in September during an accident in Texas. The upcoming flight, “Stairway to Seven,” will be the final flight of Block I of the Alpha booster.

How can launch companies compete with SpaceX? Rocket firms are divided on how to compete with SpaceX in a market where demand outstrips supply, yet customers remain price sensitive, Space News reports. During a panel at the SmallSat Symposium on February 11, executives from several launch companies acknowledged the challenge of competing with SpaceX, which accounted for about half of all orbital launches globally in 2025, despite strong customer demand for launch services.

A low price is nice … “If your idea is to go into the market competing with SpaceX on price, you’re probably not in a good competitive position,” said Brian Rogers, vice president of global launch services at Rocket Lab, one of the few small launch vehicle developers to thrive despite competition from SpaceX. But this view was far from universal. Devon Papandrew, vice president of business development at Stoke Space, disagreed. “You absolutely have to have a plan to compete with SpaceX on price,” he said.

Rocket Lab blows up a few Archimedes engines. According to reporting by Ars, Rocket Lab has blown up two Archimedes rocket engines in the last three months at its test stand in southern Mississippi. The engine test anomalies come at a critical time for Rocket Lab, as it is attempting to finalize development of a flight version of the Archimedes engine, which burns liquid oxygen and methane and has a sea-level thrust of 165,000 pounds. Nine of these engines will power the company’s much-anticipated Neutron rocket, which is aiming for a debut launch later this year.

Testing the engine to its limits … Rocket Lab Chief Executive Officer Pete Beck downplayed concerns in a statement. “We test to the limits, that’s part of developing a successful rocket,” Beck said. “We often put the engine into very off nominal states to find the limits and sometimes they let go, this is normal and how you ensure rockets don’t fail in flight.” Beck has previously said that Rocket Lab’s goal is to identify failures during component-level testing so that, when Neutron launches, it has a high chance of reaching orbit on its first attempt.

Proton rocket returns to flight. After a nearly three-year break, a Russian Proton rocket flew again with the Elektro-L No. 5 meteorological satellite from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, Russian Space Web reports. This mission was supposed to launch in late 2025, but in December, final checks revealed a problem with the Block DM-03 upper stage.

A not-so-great launch record … The mission marked the last use of the Block DM-03 space tug on Proton, which will now be solely used as an upper stage for the Angara-5 rocket. First launched in 1965, the Proton rocket has undergone several upgrades in the six decades since then. It has launched 430 times, with 48 partial and total failures. No new Protons are under construction, and it will be phased out by the end of this decade in favor of the newer Angara vehicles. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

SpaceX exempted legal labor case. The National Labor Relations Board abandoned a Biden-era complaint against SpaceX after a finding that the agency does not have jurisdiction over Elon Musk’s space company, Ars reports. The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies.

A common carrier? … In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter, criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB, claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue SpaceX raised later—that it is a common carrier, like a rail company or airline—is what compelled the NLRB to drop its case.

More powerful Ariane 6 rocket launches. This first launch of the four-booster version of Ariane 6 took place on Thursday, launching  32 satellites for Amazon’s Leo constellation to low-Earth orbit. “This first flight of Ariane 64 sustains Europe’s autonomous access to space,” Toni Tolker-Nielsen, the European Space Agency’s director of space transportation, said  in a news release.

More vrooom coming … Previous launches of Europe’s new Ariane rocket have used two solid rocket boosters. The heavier variant of the rocket is necessary to support Amazon’s constellation as well as more demanding missions to geostationary orbit. And more power is coming. In the near future, the P120C boosters will be replaced by upgraded P160C models, each carrying more than 14 metric tons of solid fuel. The Associated Press provided some interesting color behind the scenes of the launch from the location in France where the rocket’s main engines are manufactured.

Stoke Space increases fundraising round. The Washington-based launch company announced this week that it had extended its recent Series D funding round. The round was initially announced in October 2025 at $510 million, but has now been increased to $860 million. The original Series D funding focused on completing activation of Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, and expanding production capacity for the Nova launch vehicle. Stoke will use the additional capital to accelerate future elements of its product roadmap, the company said.

Putting the $ into $toke $pace … “We’re extremely grateful for our investors’ continued support,” said Andy Lapsa, co-founder and CEO of Stoke. “We’re executing with urgency to bring Nova to market and deliver for our customers. It’s a special vehicle, and there’s more in the pipeline.” With the extension, Stoke has now raised $1.34 billion to date. That is an impressive raise, and it will heighten expectations for the company’s debut of the Nova rocket.

Falcon 9 back after second stage anomaly. A Falcon 9 launched a batch of Starlink satellites on Saturday after SpaceX completed an investigation into an engine malfunction during the rocket’s previous launch, Space News reports. The rocket deployed its payload of 25 Starlink satellites into orbit about 62 minutes after liftoff. The launch was the first Falcon 9 mission since Feb. 2, when the rocket carried another set of Starlink satellites into orbit from Vandenberg.

That didn’t take long … While that mission successfully deployed its payload, SpaceX later said an “off-nominal condition” with the upper stage prevented it from performing a planned deorbit burn. The Federal Aviation Administration said Feb. 6 that it had authorized SpaceX to return the Falcon 9 to flight. “The final mishap report cites the probable root cause as the Falcon 9 second-stage engine’s failure to ignite prior to the deorbit burn,” the agency stated. “SpaceX identified technical and organizational preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of the event.” The FAA provided no additional details about the anomaly.

China performs an impressive rocket landing. China’s space program, striving to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, carried out a test flight of a new reusable booster and crew capsule late Tuesday (US time), and the results were spectacular, Ars reports. The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule’s safety system. A test version of the Mengzhou spacecraft, flying without anyone onboard, climbed into the stratosphere on top of the Long March booster before activating its launch abort motors a little more than a minute into the flight as the rocket reached the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, known as Max-Q.

China getting there on rocket reuse … The abort motors pulled the capsule away from the booster, simulating an in-flight escape that might be necessary to whisk crews away from a failing rocket. The Mengzhou spacecraft later deployed parachutes and splashed down offshore from Hainan Island. Remarkably, the booster continued its ascent without the crew capsule, soaring into space on the power of its kerosene-fueled YF-100 engines before reentering the atmosphere, reigniting its engines, and nailing a propulsive landing in the South China Sea, right next to a recovery barge waiting to bring it back to shore.

Vulcan experiences a second nozzle issue. Moments after liftoff from Florida’s Space Coast early Thursday morning, a shower of sparks emerged in the exhaust plume of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. Seconds later, the rocket twisted on its axis before recovering and continuing the climb into orbit with a batch of US military satellites, Ars reports. The sight may have appeared familiar to seasoned rocket watchers. Sixteen months ago, a Vulcan rocket lost one of its booster nozzles shortly after launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket recovered from the malfunction and still reached the mission’s planned orbit.

Next launch likely to be delayed … Details of Thursday’s booster problem remain unclear. An investigation into the matter is underway, according to ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But the circumstances resemble those of the booster malfunction in October 2024. The incident on Thursday’s mission suggests the defect was not fixed, or there is a separate problem with Northrop’s boosters. The next Vulcan launch is scheduled for no earlier than March with a GPS navigation satellite for the US Space Force. This schedule is now in doubt. The military’s Space Systems Command said in a statement it will “work closely with ULA per our mission assurance space flightworthiness process before the next Vulcan national security space mission.” (submitted by EllPeaTea)

Starship nearing next test flight. The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster, Ars reports. The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3, or Block 3.

Launch possible within the next six to eight weeks … SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3. Assuming that the remaining test work goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March.

New Glenn pushing on second stage reuse again. Engineers at Blue Origin have been grappling with a seemingly eternal debate that involves the New Glenn rocket and the economics of flying it. The debate goes back at least 15 years, to the early discussions around the design of the heavy lift rocket. The first stage, of course, would be fully reusable. But what about the upper stage of New Glenn, powered by two large BE-3U engines?

Do you want a job? … Now, Ars reports, reuse is back on the menu. Blue Origin has posted a new job listing for a director of Reusable Upper Stage Development, which says, “As the Director of Program Management for the New Glenn Upper Stage and Payload Accommodations (GS2PA), you will work with the Vice President of New Glenn GS2PA and directly support the execution of a lean engineering initiative to incrementally develop a reusable upper stage.” Ars estimates it presently costs Blue Origin more than $50 million to manufacture a New Glenn second stage.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has relied on a tremendous amount of material without permission to train its Gemini AI models. The company, alongside many of its competitors in the AI space, has been indiscriminately scraping the internet for content, without compensating rightsholders, racking up many copyright infringement lawsuits along the way.

But when it comes to its own tech being copied, Google has no problem pointing fingers. This week, the company accused “commercially motivated” actors of trying to clone its Gemini AI.

In a Thursday report, Google complained it had become under “distillation attacks,” with agents querying Gemini up to 100,000 times to “extract” the underlying model — the convoluted AI industry equivalent of copying somebody’s homework, basically.

Google called the attacks a “method of intellectual property theft that violates Google’s terms of service” — which, let’s face it, is a glaring double standard given its callous approach to scraping other IP without remuneration.

Google remained vague on who it identified as the culprits, beyond pointing out “private sector entities” and “researchers seeking to clone proprietary logic.”

The stakes are high, as companies continue to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure to make models more powerful. It’s no wonder Google is scared to lose its competitive edge as offerings start to converge at the head of the pack. The output of one pioneering model has become almost indistinguishable from another, forcing companies to try to differentiate their products.

It’s far from the first time the subject of model distillation has caused drama. Chinese startup DeepSeek rattled Silicon Valley to its core in early 2025 after showing off a far cheaper and more efficient AI model. At the time, OpenAI suggested DeepSeek may have broken its terms of service by distilling its AI models.

The ChatGPT maker quickly became the subject of widespread mockery following the comments, with netizens accusing the company of hypocrisy, pointing out that OpenAI itself had indiscriminately ripped off other people’s work for many years.

Google’s latest troubles likely won’t be the last time we hear about smaller actors trying to extract mainstream AI models through distillation.

Google’s Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told NBC News that “we’re going to be the canary in the coal mine for far more incidents.”

But whether they’ll be able to defend themselves in the coming months and years remains uncertain. AI companies remain significantly exposed since their models are available for public use.

“Historically, adversaries seeking to steal high-tech capabilities used conventional computer-enabled intrusion operations to compromise organizations and steal data containing trade secrets,” Google’s report reads. “For many AI technologies where LLMs are offered as services, this approach is no longer required; actors can use legitimate API access to attempt to ‘clone’ select AI model capabilities.”

Google outlined one case study, after finding that attackers were using “over 100,000 prompts,” suggesting an “attempt to replicate Gemini’s reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.”

However, the company’s systems “recognized this attack in real time and lowered the risk of this particular attack.”

It’s a particularly vulnerable point in time as AI companies are desperately trying to find a way of monetizing the tech through a variety of revenue drivers, from pricey subscription models to ads. With far lower upfront costs, it’s entirely possible that much smaller entities could break through, not unlike what we saw with DeepSeek in early 2025.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It isn’t exactly big news that big tech is in deep with the US government. Days after Trump’s inauguration last year, execs including OpenAI’s Sam Altman flocked to the Oval Office to announce a $500 billion AI infrastructure project — and they’ve remained deeply sycophantic ever since.

Now that obsequiousness could be coming back to haunt them. As reported by MIT Technology Review, activists critical of the Trump administration and the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement have started a campaign called QuitGPT, urging regular users to ditch OpenAI’s chatbot for good.

So far, the campaign boasts over 700,000 supporters of the boycott. The QuitGPT website lists a few different ways to participate: quitting ChatGPT outright, cancelling paid subscriptions, and spreading the word about the boycott with others on social media.

As for why, the activists behind the boycott point to OpenAI’s incredibly tight relationship with the Trump administration. As QuitGPT notes, OpenAI president Greg Brockman famously donated $25 million to a Trump Super PAC in 2025, while ICE uses an AI tool powered by ChatGPT for recruitment.

“They’re cozying up to Trump while ICE is killing Americans and the Department of Justice is trying to take over elections,” the QuitGPT organizers write on their website. “ChatGPT enables mental-health crises through sycophancy and dependence by replacing human relationships with AI girlfriends/boyfriends. Many employees have quit OpenAI because of its leadership’s lies, deception and recklessness.”

For freelance software developer Alfred Stephen, Brockman’s donation to Trump’s political action committee was what urged him to join the boycott.

“That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Stephen told Tech Review. When he cancelled his $20 a month subscription, a customer feedback survey appeared asking what OpenAI could do to keep his business. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Congratulations, office workers. Most of what you do at your cozy desk jobs will soon be automated with AI, according to the extremely questionable projections of Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman.

That’s because AI models, as Suleyman claims in an interview with the Financial Times published Wednesday, are on the verge of achieving “human-level performance on most, if not all professional tasks.”

“So white collar work where you’re sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person, most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months,” Suleyman said.

Suleyman’s bold assertion comes amid renewed anxiety over AI’s potential to disrupt the job market. The release of Anthropic’s new Claude Cowork AI agent helped spark a broad stock market selloff last week, as investors feared that it could automate tasks like legal work, something that also jeopardized the bottom line of large software companies who make a killing off of providing the specialized programs to complete those office tasks.

According to the Microsoft AI chief, heavy AI automation can already be seen in fields like software engineering.

“Many software engineers report that they are now using AI-assisted coding for the vast majority of their code production,” Suleyman said in the interview, “which means that their roles shifted now to this meta function of debugging, scrutinizing, of doing the strategic stuff like architecting,” and “putting things into production.”

“So it’s a quite different relationship to the technology,” he added. “And that’s happened in the last six months.”

It’s true that many programmers are now using AI coding tools and agents. Microsoft’s CEO — the main one, not the AI one — Satya Nadella has claimed that over a quarter of its code is written with AI.

But the quality of AI-generated code and other outputs remains suspect, with some studies finding that these purported automation miracles overwhelmingly fail to complete common remote work and office tasks.

Equally suspect is AI’s ability to yield economic gains for the companies that embrace it. Some research suggests that AI does not lead to an increase in productivity and may even slow down workflows, including in fields like programming, where humans are forced to double and triple check AI outputs. AI may in reality be intensifying work, as its introduction leads to employees being expected to take on even greater workloads, resulting in burnout and lower quality work.

Nonetheless, AI leaders insist on sounding the alarm. Last summer, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei proclaimed that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed that the tech is poised to destroy entire categories of work.

Don’t get us wrong: AI-related layoffs are already happening. Many companies, however, are arguably using the pretense of AI to fire employees for purely financial reasons, a practice that some are calling “AI washing.” And given how fresh AI automation is, it’s still unclear how sustainable it will be for companies to heavily depend on the tech in the long-term, a reality that some over-eager firms are already having to reckon with.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic is taking off the gloves and ramping up its war with bitter rival OpenAI.

On Thursday, the Claude chatbot maker announced it was pouring $20 million into a new super PAC formed to oppose the super PACs backed by OpenAI figures, The New York Times reports.

With the donation, the dueling companies are poised to fight over shaping the future of the industry’s regulation by backing favored candidates in the upcoming midterm elections. Anthropic, generally speaking, is in favor of stronger guardrails, while OpenAI opposes stricter regulation.

“The AI policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” Anthropic wrote in the announcement. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”

Anthropic was founded in 2021 with a focus on safety. It was formed from a splinter group of former OpenAI employees, including Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei, who left the company because of differences over its direction after the then-nonprofit accepted $1 billion in funding from Microsoft.

The super PAC Anthropic is now pouring money into, Public First Action, was formed along similar lines, with the ostensible bipartisan mission of preventing political power from being concentrated in OpenAI. Per the NYT, it will operate as a “dark money” nonprofit, which allows it to air political ads without disclosing its donors. One candidate it will be supporting is Senator Marsha Blackburn (TN-R), a vocal AI critic who’s running for state governor.

The Anthropic-backed group is going up against Leading the Future, an anti-regulation super PAC backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, including Andreessen Horowitz. It has reportedly raised over $100 million, though it’s only publicly disclosed half that amount.

It’s a bold and risky escalation by Anthropic that could land it in the crosshairs of powerful enemies. As the reporting notes, OpenAI is in the good graces of the Trump administration, with the company’s president being a top donor to the one in the Oval Office. OpenAI is pro-deregulation, and so is Trump. Anthropic and Amodei, by contrast, have been blasted by figures in the administration for opposing Trump’s proposed suspension on states passing their own AI laws, earning accusations of “fear-mongering.”

Anthropic’s announcement parted with what could be interpreted as a thinly-veiled dig at OpenAI, which converted itself into a for-profit corporation despite being originally formed as an altruist nonprofit.

“The companies building AI have a responsibility to help ensure the technology serves the public good, not just their own interests,” it read.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What if the biggest threat to your safety and privacy isn’t a person, but a device millions of Americans have installed in their homes willingly?

That’s the contention of tech critics at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who say Amazon’s Ring doorbell devices constitute a “surveillance nightmare” — what they’re calling the largest civilian surveillance panopticon in the history of the United States.

The pitch is that Ring doorbells help homeowners watch out for porch pirates and incoming trick-or-treaters. But they do so, the digital rights advocacy group charges, at a staggering cost to your privacy. For example, Ring has previously been sued by the Federal Trade Commission for illegally collecting and storing audio and video data between 2017 and 2020. That particular issue came to a head in 2023, after the company was found to give employees extensive access to footage captured by Ring devices — including for cameras inside people’s homes.

And sure, you could argue, that wouldn’t be an issue if you simply use the company’s devices on your porch. Not even that’s a safe bet, however. Back in 2022, Consumer Reports found that Ring doorbells could record ambient audio from 20 feet away — allowing them to listen in on pedestrians, neighbors, and in some cases, even in on homeowners who keep their doors or windows open.

All of this feeds into what the EFF calls the “digital porch-to-police pipeline,” where tech enables paranoid homeowners to make snap judgements about who does or doesn’t belong in their neighborhood and easily dispatch police to confront them. Indeed, since at least 2016, Ring has made it a point to loop law enforcement agencies like the Los Angeles Police Department into its business through free giveaways and warrantless access to user footage.

As research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School Chris Gilliard told Consumer Reports, any surveillance devices will disproportionately impact those who already face the highest amount of repression from law enforcement — like Black and immigrant communities. “That’s a truism of surveillance: It’s going to fall earliest and most often on the marginalized,” Gilliard said.

And with Ring’s recently announced “Search Party” function, in which Ring can track down a dog by chaining multiple devices together, things are looking even more dystopian. In a statement, Ring said it “built the feature with strong privacy protections from the start,” allowing owners to “choose on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner to support a reunion.”

Yet as the EFF points out, the devices already have a baked-in facial recognition feature for humans. Simply put, it’s not hard to imagine a world where Ring and tech like it makes privacy in public impossible. Maybe the right question to ask isn’t whether Ring will build it — but whether we’ll notice before the panopticon becomes irreversible.

One thing’s for sure: the pressure’s getting to Ring. After backlash to the company’s disastrous Super Bowl ad, it announced that it’s canceling its partnership with Flock, a controversial surveillance startup that would have looped its cameras into an even larger network.

            <div id="article-text">For months, experts have warned that prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket were ripe for abuse. Now, some Israeli soldiers may have proved them right in particularly grisly fashion: by betting on strikes they allegedly helped plan.

According to the Wall Street Journal, several Israeli citizens, including a number of Israeli Defense Force reservists, have been arrested over the use of classified information to place Polymarket bets.

Per the WSJ‘s reporting, one as-yet anonymous Polymarket account, ricosuave666 — an apparent nod to the Latin pop superstar — made seven predictions about Israel’s twelve-day war with Iran last June, before walking away with over $150,000 in combined bets. Others took notice at the time, though the account went dormant for about six months.

It finally reactivated in January, reportedly to bet on Israel’s next strike on Iran. Though Israel carried out plenty of other strikes in January as tensions remained steady with Iran, a direct attack on the Islamic Republic hasn’t been reported.

Many mysteries remain. Since the WSJ published its article, it seems the Polymarket account has been scrubbed, and the publication didn’t confirm ricosuave66 was one of the accounts under investigation.

Still, the news follows a number of other fishy-looking inside trades, like the bettor who made out like a bandit after an improbable bet placed just hours before the deadly kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by the US military.

If the Israeli bettors are shown to be military insiders, their case is sure to become the exemplar of everything wrong with prediction markets — like the fact that they allow bets on violent international events in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Starting Friday, OpenAI will cease providing access  to five legacy ChatGPT models, including the popular but controversial GPT-4o model.

The 4o model has been at the center of a number of lawsuits concerning user self-harm, delusional behavior, and AI psychosis. It remains OpenAI’s highest scoring model for sycophancy.

In addition to GPT-4o, the GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini models have also been deprecated.

OpenAI intended to retire GPT-4o in August, when it unveiled the GPT-5 model. But at the time, there was enough backlash for OpenAI to keep the legacy model available for paid subscribers, who could manually choose to interact with that model. In a recent blog post, OpenAI noted that only 0.1% of customers have been using GPT-4o, but for a company with 800 million weekly active users, that small percentage still amounts to 800,000 people.

Thousands of users have rallied against the retirement of 4o, citing their close relationships with the model.

            <h2>The SEC closed its investigation into Fisker</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation into bankrupt electric vehicle startup Fisker  last September, roughly one year after the probe was opened.

TechCrunch learned the investigation was closed when the financial regulator responded to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in January. The SEC’s FOIA department said it had identified “approximately 21.7 gigabytes of electronically maintained records” related to the investigation. The agency doesn’t typically make records available if investigations are still open, and it explained in a follow-up email that it “was closed in September 2025.”

It’s not clear how far the investigation progressed. The SEC revealed the existence of the probe in an October 2024 filing in Fisker’s bankruptcy case. The agency wrote at the time that it had sent subpoenas to the company and that it may need to “request or subpoena additional documents in the future relating to its ongoing investigation.”

A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment. Founder and former CEO Henrik Fisker did not respond to a message seeking comment.

The closure of the Fisker investigation comes amid a significant drop in enforcement actions and settlements during President Trump’s second term. The SEC initiated 313 enforcement actions in 2025 — the lowest in a decade and down 27% from the the final year of President Biden’s term, according to an analysis by law firm Paul, Weiss. Only four of those enforcement actions were against public companies. Total monetary settlements fell 45% from 2024.

Fisker was one of the last remaining electric vehicle startups under investigation by the SEC. Over the last few years, the agency settled fraud or other charges brought against Nikola, Lordstown Motors, Canoo, Hyzon Motors, and others. In 2023, it closed an investigation into Lucid Motors without a lawsuit.

The only known active investigation remaining into an electric vehicle startup is the one related to Faraday Future, which is now nearly four years old. In July 2025, the SEC sent Faraday and multiple executives “Wells notices,” or letters that inform a subject that the investigators recommend an enforcement action. No action has been taken since those letters were sent, though, and Faraday’s own regulatory filings indicate it has not yet responded to the Wells notices.

Fisker filed for bankruptcy in June 2024 amid a raft of problems with its first EV, the Ocean SUV. The company spent years making bold promises about developing radical new technologies, but pivoted from those ideas multiple times. It also had major financial trouble in the run-up to its collapse. It used the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process to sell off its remaining inventory of Oceans to a company that leases vehicles to ride-hail drivers and liquidate its other assets.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India’s government has partnered with China’s Alibaba.com on an export-focused program aimed at helping startups and small businesses reach overseas buyers. The move highlights New Delhi’s selective engagement with Chinese-linked tech platforms years after it imposed sweeping bans on consumer apps and games.

This week, the Indian government’s Startup India initiative announced the collaboration with Alibaba.com to identify and support Indian startups that can help onboard and scale Indian exporters on the group’s global B2B platform. The program offers commissions and technical support to those startups to assist small manufacturers and traders in reaching overseas markets.

The new partnership arrives after years of strained India–China relations. New Delhi banned dozens of Chinese-linked apps in 2020 following a deadly border clash, including major platforms such as TikTok, PUBG Mobile, and AliExpress, an e-commerce app operated by Alibaba Group. Those restrictions remain in place, making the Indian government’s public collaboration with Alibaba’s export-focused platform a carefully circumscribed form of engagement rather than a broader policy reset.

India’s export ambitions are closely tied to its small businesses and the platforms they use to reach overseas markets. Micro, small, and medium enterprises account for nearly half of the country’s exports and about 31% of GDP, according to the Indian government’s latest Economic Survey, underlining why New Delhi has focused on expanding digital market access for smaller firms through global B2B channels, including Alibaba.com.

Alibaba.com’s B2B platform connects more than 50 million active buyers across over 200 countries and regions, said Rocky Lu, head of India business at the company.

“Alibaba.com has been active in India for over two decades, and we remain dedicated to our core mission of empowering MSMEs to scale their businesses globally,” Lu told TechCrunch. “Our focus continues to be on leveraging our digital infrastructure to help ‘Made in India’ products reach an international audience through digital transformation.”

Lu did not confirm whether the Startup India initiative marks Alibaba.com’s first direct partnership with India’s federal government since 2020. He said, however, that the company has “maintained a consistent cadence of engagement with various government and semi-government bodies integral to the Indian export ecosystem,” including through digital training programs for MSMEs and collaborations with export promotion councils.

The partnership reflects India’s differentiated approach toward China, maintaining restrictions in strategic and security-sensitive sectors while allowing economic engagement where there is clear benefit, said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of the New Delhi-based public policy think tank The Dialogue.

“Going forward, regulatory clarity will be important,” Rizvi told TechCrunch. “Predictable policy environments will help ensure that startups feel confident participating in such initiatives.”

The Indian government seems to be drawing a distinction between export-focused platforms and consumer-facing Chinese apps, said George Chen, partner and co-chair of the digital practice at The Asia Group, a Washington-based consultancy that advises companies on policy and geopolitical risks across Asia. Chen, who previously served as a regional public policy director at Meta, said New Delhi sees value in Alibaba’s role in supporting B2B exports, particularly given the platform’s reach in markets such as Africa, which could help Indian exporters diversify their global sales.

India appears to be drawing lessons from China’s approach to digital platforms, Chen told TechCrunch.

“China bans foreign apps like Facebook and Instagram for Chinese individual users but still allows Facebook and Google to do business with Chinese companies, especially exporters who rely on those platforms to sell products abroad,” Chen said.

The Startup India collaboration follows other recent steps by Alibaba.com to expand export-focused services in India. In June 2025, the company launched its Trade Assurance program in the country, aimed at helping Indian small and medium-sized exporters manage risks in cross-border transactions through payment protection and dispute-resolution tools.

The developments also come as India and China show tentative signs of improved engagement in multilateral technology forums, with Chinese representatives expected to attend the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi next week. Indian officials, however, have not indicated any change to restrictions on Chinese consumer technology platforms.

The Indian commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comments.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic’s Super Bowl ads — which feature darkly comedic scenarios of people seeking advice from chatbots, only to be steered to “cougar” dating sites and height-boosting insoles — have been paying off. In the days since, Anthropic’s AI chatbot Claude has climbed from No. 41 on the U.S. App Store to become a top 10 app. As of Friday, Claude sits at No. 7 — its highest rank to date — suggesting its “no ads” pitch resonates strongly with users.

According to new data from market intelligence provider Appfigures, Claude’s U.S. downloads across both iOS and Android totaled an estimated 148,000 from Sunday through Tuesday — the most recent data available. That’s a 32% increase from the preceding three days, Thursday through Saturday, where downloads totaled approximately 112,000.

Claude’s daily average number of downloads from Sunday through Tuesday was 49,200, up 32% from the usual Sunday through Tuesday average of 37,400 per day.

The numbers suggest that Anthropic’s Super Bowl commercials, combined with Anthropic’s recent release of its new Opus 4.6 model, worked to drive attention to Claude’s app and its key differentiator from ChatGPT. The latter rolled out ads to free users this week, just as Anthropic’s ads had warned.

As a result, Claude’s app is gaining more attention than it did when it first debuted on mobile.

The consumer-focused AI app arrived on iOS in May 2024 to a fairly tepid reception. ChatGPT had beaten it to market on mobile devices and had grown to nearly half a million installs in its first five days. By comparison, Claude had only pulled in 157,000 total global downloads within its first week and didn’t reach a rank higher than No. 55 on the U.S. App Store.

Globally, Claude saw some gains this past week, too. Overall worldwide downloads of Claude across both the App Store and Google Play grew 15% from Sunday to Tuesday versus last Thursday to Saturday. However, this was less than half the gains seen in the U.S., Appfigures noted.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/roku-to-launch-streaming-bundles-as-part-of-its-efforts-to-continue-growing-its-profitability/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Roku shared its fourth-quarter earnings for 2025 this week, as well as some exciting plans in the pipeline. The company is rolling out new streaming bundles, expanding its $3 subscription service, Howdy, to more platforms, and partnering with more premium streaming services following the successful addition of HBO Max.

Launching bundles in 2026 is a smart move, as it could attract more viewers looking for enticing deals amid rising subscription prices. Many streaming platforms have been increasing their rates recently, and Roku aims to appeal to cost-conscious consumers. The positive impact of HBO Max on Roku’s premium subscriptions has encouraged the company to continue this strategy by adding more top-tier partners, which is likely to drive growth going forward.

Additionally, Roku launched its ad-free subscription streaming service, Howdy, last year and plans to expand its availability beyond the Roku platform. While specific details remain undisclosed, Roku CEO Anthony Wood stated at CES last month that the goal is to distribute Howdy widely, saying, “We want to distribute it everywhere.”

Other highlights include Roku users streaming 145.6 billion hours of video in 2025, marking a 15% increase from 2024. The company is also nearing the milestone of 100 million streaming households, though it has decided to report this figure less frequently.

Financially, Roku delivered an impressive quarter, posting net income of $80.5 million, a rebound from a $35.5 million loss in the same period last year. Total revenue for Q4 2025 reached $1.4 billion, representing a 16% year-over-year increase.

Looking ahead, Roku is optimistic, projecting total net revenue of $5.5 billion and gross profit of $2.4 billion.

“In 2023, our priority was to rightsize our cost structure and reach adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2024, and we achieved that goal a full year ahead of schedule,” Wood told investors during the call yesterday afternoon. “Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, we are confident in our ability to sustain double-digit platform revenue growth while continuing to grow profitability.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Valentine’s Day approaches at Stanford, some students may be gearing up for first dates — not with people they met on Tinder or Hinge, but with matches from a service called Date Drop, designed by Stanford graduate student Henry Weng. Date Drop pairs students with potential dates once per week based on their responses to a questionnaire.

A Stanford whiz kid is trying to disrupt an established industry from his Palo Alto dorm? Stop me if you’ve heard this one before! But young adults are deeply disillusioned with the frustrating, demoralizing state of online dating. Why not try something different?

Over 5,000 students at Stanford have given Date Drop a try since its launch in the fall. It has also rolled out at 10 more schools, including MIT, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania, and Weng says he wants to roll out Date Drop more broadly in some cities this summer.

“Our matches convert to actual dates at about 10x the rate of Tinder,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Instead of swiping, we get to know each person deeply and send them one compatible match per week.”

At first, Weng didn’t intend to turn Date Drop into the foundation of a startup. Then, a close friend of his met their partner via Date Drop. “That was when I got the sense that this was less of a project,” he said.

Now, Weng thinks of Date Drop as just the first service from his startup, The Relationship Company, which is a public benefit corporation — a type of company legally required to consider social impact alongside profits.

“This started as something I just wanted to exist on campus, and it became a company because people kept on asking for it in their schools and I needed resources to do that,” he said.

Already, Weng has raised “a few million” from some angel investors, including Zynga founder and early Facebook backer Mark Pincus, who has taught business courses at Stanford (including to Weng). Andy Chen, a former partner at Coatue, and Elad Gil, an early backer of Airbnb, Stripe, and Pinterest, also invested in The Relationship Company.

“The long-term vision at The Relationship Company is about facilitating all meaningful relationships: friendships, professional connections, community, events,” Weng said.

It’s par for the course to use algorithms to predict if users of a dating service may be compatible with one another — that’s how dating apps work. But Weng says his model is more geared toward forging long-term connections, with 95% of Date Drop users saying they’re interested in relationships.

Weng explains that there are two core elements at play. First, the questionnaire needs to be thorough enough to capture a real picture of who someone is. “We do that through the questions, open-ended responses, a voice conversation, and other data that the users provide,” he said.

The next challenge is compatibility prediction. “Because we help people plan dates, we have data on which matches actually work out. So we have a model trained on real-world outcomes,” he said. “Once you have those two components, the actual matching is standard stuff from matching theory literature.”

Currently pursuing a computer science master’s degree at Stanford, Weng has oriented his education around the economic and mathematical concepts of matching. As a Stanford undergrad, he created his own major to study humans, matching, and incentives.

“I started to see how matching shapes so much of our lives,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Who your life partner is, who your friends are, what college you go to, which company you work for are all matching problems.”

Beyond his technical education, Weng found an unexpected class useful for learning to manage a startup: “Intro to Clown.”

“A core principle of clowning is that clowns are failures, and instead of fearing failure, they revel in it,” he said. “As a product builder, your entire journey is just repeatedly failing and getting back up. Clown class was a wonderful microcosm of that.”

So far, The Relationship Company has two employees besides Weng, along with 12 students who serve as campus ambassadors. Because their work revolves around forging matches, Weng has extended that mindset to how he manages the company. He offers employees a $100 monthly “relationship stipend,” which they can spend on dates, gifts, experiences, or anything that helps them deepen an important relationship of any sort.

“Relationships are the single most important factor in a person’s life,” Weng said. “There’s also great research showing that money spent on other people makes you happier than money spent on yourself.”

Weng’s fascination with how people form relationships has also informed how he goes about his day-to-day life.

“Date Drop has shown me how many interesting people are out there that you’d never encounter through your normal routines,” he said. “It’s made me more open to people I wouldn’t have crossed paths with otherwise.”

On this week’s Galaxy Brain, the host Charlie Warzel dives into the state of the music industry, where streaming economics, algorithmic discovery, and generative AI are reshaping how music is distributed, as well as what it means to make music in this environment. The episode traces how playlists and opaque recommendation systems have left many artists feeling like they’re battling an algorithm. With AI-generated songs now flooding platforms, and even in one case landing on a Billboard chart, the episode examines how automation, impersonation, and synthetic “diet music” are crowding into a system already strained by low payouts and creative burnout.

Charlie is joined by Stu Mackenzie, the front man of the prolific Australian band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, to talk about making music in the algorithmic age. From embracing bootleggers to pulling its catalog from Spotify, Mackenzie explains how the band has tried to protect its creative core while the industry transforms around it. Charlie and Stu explore whether we’re witnessing a normal technological shift or something more existential—an era where music is treated as pure commodity.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Stu Mackenzie: This ship has, like, well and truly sailed. I mean, it is totally wack to be able to train the algorithm on artists’ work. Totally wack. Like totally cooked.

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel, a staff writer at The Atlantic. And this is Galaxy Brain, a show where today we’re going to talk about music—making it, the future of it, and the ways that technology has complicated that future quite a bit.

Throughout the last decade I’ve been fortunate enough to meet and interview a bunch of musicians across a bunch of genres and levels of fame. And inevitably, the conversation always shifts toward streaming. You’re probably familiar with the basic gripes: Streaming has atomized a musician’s catalog, prioritizing tracks over albums. The economics stink for artists. Musicians have to get big—like really almost Taylor Swift big—to make big money from the streamers. And in order to get big, musicians now need to play the platform game: the same one that creators and average Joes posting anywhere online have to play. Getting put on Spotify or another streamer’s curated playlists is crucial, but so is navigating whatever proprietary algorithms the streaming service might be employing to surface music for listeners.

And so the result has been the kind of frustration you hear from creators everywhere—it is this feeling of having to shadowbox an algorithm to fight for scraps of attention. And it is here where the conversations tend to get, honestly, pretty dark. The musicians I’ve spoken with describe weird things happening—an experimental song from the end of an album, that doesn’t really sound a ton like them, blows up because it got picked up by an algorithm—and that makes it so the streamer lumps their band in with a genre they rarely play in, and then it is harder for their best work to get discovered. Artists who have viral success on one track can find themselves trapped in the same sound, and they’re just chasing the algorithm, hoping to strike gold again. They describe a pressure to churn out new songs and albums faster and faster every year. And there’s this creative confusion that many record labels don’t have answers for. Here’s what one musician told me back in 2024: “Nobody knows what matters, and it’s just like wandering in the desert.”

And the streaming climate has only gotten more precarious since then. With generative AI, it’s now possible to create entire complex songs with a text prompt, or just by humming into your smartphone. Major record labels, like Warner, have recently partnered with generative-AI music companies, like Suno—whose CEO, Mikey Shulman, said in an interview with The Guardian this year that, “I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.” Now, in the interview he’s referring to the tedious bits of engineering work, but he clearly sees that automating the creative process is a good thing. “It was described to me that we are the Ozempic of the music industry—everybody is on it, and nobody wants to talk about it.”

As it turns out, all that diet music—it’s going somewhere. It’s flooding onto the streamers. For the last few years, across genres, synthetic music has been crowding out human-made music. Chances are, especially if you listen to instrumental music, you’ve unknowingly streamed some smooth jazz conjured by a bot. In late September, an AI-generated song under the [artist] name of Xania Monet became the first to debut on the Billboard radio chart.

There’s other issues, too, like impersonation. The website Rest of World reported last fall, for example, that somebody cloned the voice of reggaeton singer Bad Bunny—perhaps you’ve heard of him—and created a song that reached a top 100 ranking temporarily on Spotify in Chile. That was, before it was removed from the platform.

All of this brings us to King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard. For the uninitiated, King Gizzard is a popular and prolific Australian band known for bending genres, ripping live shows, and for putting out dozens of albums in a short period. (For example, in 2017 they released five albums in one year.) In July, the group took its music off of Spotify in protest of the Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s decision to lead a nearly 700 million–dollar investment in a German company that makes military drones and AI-defense tools. “Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better?” That’s what the band wrote on their post on Instagram.

But, as the newsletter Platformer reported last year, some King Gizzard fans noticed that several tracks were still available on Spotify. It wasn’t King Gizzard’s actual music, but a kind of ringtone, Muzak-style cover of their songs with similar artwork and information attached. It was only when people clicked on the track that, according to Platformer, it redirected to a different page for a different instrumental-cover artist. The fake King Gizzard songs reportedly had more than 10 million streams. When alerted, Spotify got rid of the fake songs. But the debacle illustrates what artists are up against. Staying on the platform can mean having to play this unwinnable game. But leaving has its challenges, too—losing discovery and, perhaps, having to fend off squatters.

Here’s where I should note that we reached out to Spotify about the King Gizzard situation and AI impersonation in general. A spokesperson acknowledged that “AI is accelerating problems that already exist across the music industry, including impersonation and fraud.” The company shared a series of new policies it announced in September, including “stronger rules requiring artist authorization for vocal imitation and standardized AI-disclosure credits developed with industry partners.”

They continued: “Bad actors can sometimes exploit gaps to push incorrect content onto artist profiles. We are testing new prevention tactics with distributors, investing more resources into content-mismatch review, reducing review times, and allowing artists to report mismatches even before release.”

A spokesman also countered a claim you’re going to hear later in the episode, which is that Spotify pays worse than other streamers. “Every other streaming service pays less than Spotify. Spotify paid out $11 billion to the music industry last year,” they said.

That’s Spotify’s perspective. But what have streamers done to music? What does it mean to make art and music online in 2026, and how can people stay sane and navigate this ecosystem? I figured there was no better person to talk to about this than the front man of King Gizzard: Stu Mackenzie. Stu joined me recently from Melbourne at 3 a.m. my time to help me understand if we’re all, in his own words, “cooked.” Here’s my conversation with Stu.

Warzel: Alright. Stu, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Thank you so much for joining me from Australia.

Mackenzie: What’s up? Yeah, welcome from the other side of the world.

Warzel: It’s summer there, right? You’re, like, actually living the dream there instead of the crushing fatigue of winter that we’ve got going.

Mackenzie: It is a dream, and it is always summer in Australia. Not really, but you know, it is if you believe it is. It is if you’re living in the dream.

Warzel: Love it. It feels like it. I want to start out just by asking: We’re kind of a similar age; you’re an extremely creative and artistic person. What’s your relationship to the internet and technology? Is it an engine of creativity for you? Is it a hindrance? Some of your past interviews about recording—it suggests like even some of that, that you did was a bit analog in nature. But what is your relationship to internet technology and all that as an artist?

Mackenzie: I’m probably going to give you an answer which is probably typical of someone who’s 35—i.e., me and people of our gen—in that it’s incredible. And that it has allowed me to have access to so much music, but also art and culture and everything that was just not accessible to people of 10 or so years before us. And you have to pay that. You have to just go, Fuck, this shit is amazing. You know, like, I hate my phone. I want to fucking throw this shit off a bridge. I want to throw it every single day. At some point, I want to throw my phone into a body of water. But I also just think it’s incredible. You know, like look at this thing—what this shit does is amazing. We’re talking to each other, you know, on the other side of the world, like pretty fucking seamlessly. That is cool.

Warzel: I’ve heard in interviews you say when the band was really starting, it was, like, MySpace days. Obviously things look a lot different now. And I was wondering if you could trace a little bit of that change for me and how it feels from your perspective: evolving as a band and just having the ability to reach people and share your music changing so much. How has that looked and felt to you? Net positive? Sort of net negative? Where do you come out on that?

Mackenzie: I’ve probably got a perspective on this that I’m not sure a lot of my sort of peers or buddies would have the same one as, to be honest. Because for us—the band, I mean—King Gizzard had started in this kind of beautiful, low-pressure scenario. It started in this way of it being a side project, and it worked because it was easy, actually. Not easy in a work sense, but easy in an it fit sense. We did what we wanted to do. From the beginning, it was baked into the whole idea of it, because people didn’t feel pressured to be in this band. It was this weird side-project thing that people weren’t supposed to be paying attention to. So it let us kind of just do whatever we want and not worry about it. But I think when for whatever reason, some people started to support the band, and it kind of got to a point where it felt like maybe we should sort of put some more time and effort into this thing. I think we probably quite sensibly realized that that was actually quite a seed, or DNA, to what the band was. And I think we’ve been pretty good at holding onto that.

And I say that because I think, for the most part, we operate exactly the same as we did even when we had a MySpace. It was kind of just like: We don’t engage super deeply with social media. We don’t create content. But we don’t do anything that’s tough. We just sort of make albums at the pace we want to, and we put out music at the pace we want to. And we still work with the same people, the same sort of small team for the most part. We just have kind of not stopped doing. And I think a lot of the things around us have changed. We’ve tried really hard to stay the same on the inside. And I know that that is so lucky, and I know that we’re very grateful to be able to do that. And it’s weird, but I do truly, like—we’ve grown as people individually in our own ways, and the six of us in the band have grown up with each other and while doing this thing. But when we’re together, it’s still the same. And I’m quite protective of that.

Warzel: That’s really lovely, and something that I think is really rare. But also, I think that’s a good vein for this conversation, in a way: to talk about how you’ve gone about protecting that a little bit, or how you’ve gone about using that to your advantage as a band in this information hellscape, to some degree, or just like chaos. And so I’m curious: Can you talk to me a little bit about the bootlegger stuff, which to me feels really of the spirit of the internet in the good way, and what that is exactly. And why you decided to start doing that—not just like giving the music away, but giving people authorization to press their own albums, sell copies, and things like that.

Mackenzie: Explaining the King Gizzard version of bootlegging is weirdly hard, I think. Let me give it a go. So basically, quite a few years ago, we noticed that people were sort of making, I mean, what I would have described at that time as bootleg copies of our albums. And this was at a time where a lot of our early material had only ever been pressed physically one time: at the very beginning when we released those earlier albums. In quite a few of those first ones, we’d never toured outside of Australia. So we might have pressed 200 or 300 copies, and they had all sold to our friends and our friends’ friends, basically. And then we started to become an internationally touring band and doing all these bizarre things that we never thought were supposed to happen to us. Then, you know, all these other people, and all over the world were like, Hey, can I get a copy of them? One of those records? And we’re like, Oh, really? We’re making this other stuff now. I don’t know. We just didn’t really prioritize looking backward at all. And so I suppose because of that, people started building their records. And then concurrently to that, people started taping our shows. And that was also just a deeply strange and foreign concept to see that, because I didn’t grow up with that culture in any way. I just thought that was super weird. But I suppose I started thinking about that a lot, and how I kind of just actually thought that was very cool. I thought the bootlegging thing was always very cool because we—I never had a problem with people doing that—because they weren’t accessible anyway. I was just happy for people to be listening to the music. And at the beginning it was like, Why don’t we just give them a few albums that they can just do whatever with? Why don’t we just let them do whatever with a few albums? And that’s what we did. We also did this album called Polygondwanaland, which was sort of a prog-rock studio album, I guess.

Mackenzie: And we released five albums in that year. And it did start to feel a bit, sort of, capitalist of us, maybe against some of our core values to continually ask people to buy our shit.

Warzel: Five albums in a year is a lot, yeah. I get that.

Mackenzie: Yeah, exactly. So the fourth of the fifth, which was Polygondwanaland, we just made for free. You know, we thought, Well, we should really make this free. Like really free, you know, like this is not just a free download. Like, this doesn’t belong to us. It was like: This is free. You know what free is? This is free. So it was kind of like, you can put it on your movie soundtrack. You can put it on your—you can put it anywhere. Whatever you want. You can take it to the pressing plant and make 1,000 copies and start a record label. You know, you can do anything. This was back in 2017. Looking back after a year of that or something, it was like all these record labels had started up. And all this, sort of, a community of people sprung up around this album. And it did feel like—it just felt so beautiful. It felt kind of like creating life. And it just felt so kind of contrasting to so many of the annoying things about being in a band, where you have to kind of sustain yourself and you have to be a business. So that’s just so annoying. Fucking play music. And it just felt so in line with all of that. But yeah, now we do—just tons of our music is just bootleggable. Just do whatever you want. You can listen to it or download it for free or do normal-people stuff. Or you can do crazy-people stuff and make record labels and shit.

Warzel: And people have, right? Record labels have come out of that, right? It’s wild.

Mackenzie: Yeah, it’s like … it’s so cool. It’s amazing. Yeah.

Warzel: So what I think is interesting about that, is: I want to talk to you in a minute about some of the Spotify stuff. Some of the stuff that has been hard and squeezing artists to some degree. And some of that all comes from this idea, right, of: You’ve got to find and build community in whatever ways that you can, right? Get the music out to people, but also have something there. And I feel like what you guys have, whether you stumbled upon it or whether it’s just, you know, the way that your ethos as a band and as human beings have decided to be creative and make art, is that it seems like you’ve been able to bypass a little of that commercialization and form that community. Which then, in turn, is sustaining, right? Like, I think about Phish, the [Grateful] Dead, you know, the idea of that sort of taping community, right? And this idea of like, We’re going to play lots of live shows. People are going to go, and we encourage that taping. That thing gives, as you just said, gives us the ability to deliver a different kind of show every night—that creative challenge of improvisation and locking in and all that stuff. But at the same time, too, it creates this ecosystem, right? And the ecosystem can then become as obsessive as you want to be over shows and archives and “last time played” and “first time played,” and all these different types of things. And it builds the lore. And it fosters that community in a way that I think ends up being probably way more generative, right, than just like, Yes, stream our album. Here it is. And then here’s the next one. Right?

Mackenzie: Yeah. That’s my worst nightmare: to kind of be, like, just constantly trying to push the thing. That’s not fun. No shade to anyone who wants to operate like that, but it doesn’t work for me. It’s a personal preference, I think. And I do feel extremely, extremely fortunate to be able to take the kind of risks and the wild swings. We take tons of falls, too. But we’ve been able to weather it. I’m very grateful for that. It does also—and I know you want to talk about Spotify stuff and everything—but it does sort of make me feel like we have a bit of a duty to do stuff like that. Because King Gizzard exists in this weird realm of “It exists because we kind of took risks the whole time.” It hasn’t been, sort of, despite that. It’s been because of that. And I think we are just luckily and beautifully placed to just be ourselves. And I kind of feel like we have a duty to do that, in some ways, because I know that in so many ways it is easier for us to do it than for other people. And so now, with something like Spotify: Like, it doesn’t pay the bills anyway. For the most part, we’re kind of a touring band, and we make records that people buy IRL. Like, I don’t know. We sort of just exist in our own sort of—we’d whirled over to the side.

Warzel: Right. So let’s just talk about the Spotify stuff, since we’re there. So last summer, you all made a decision to remove the music. It sounds like Spotify CEO Daniel Ek leading the investing of this military-drone company was, I guess, the last straw. You mentioned earlier just that this wasn’t something that’s necessarily paying the bills. Can you walk me through the decision? In terms of what else, in your experience with the platform, led to this, you know?

Mackenzie: It’s a pretty evil corporation, for the most part. I mean, and to be fair, so are a few of the other streaming services as well. And it’s actually kind of easy to hate Spotify, to be honest, as an artist. Like, they pay way worse than almost all the others to begin with, and they’re the biggest. So they’re kind of setting the standards in so many ways. I feel like all my mates were already saying “Fuck Spotify” constantly anyway, before we did it. And before all of the military-investing stuff came up, as well.

It does sort of feel like when you’re making music, making music is—maybe this goes without saying, or maybe I’m just going to say it—it’s such a vulnerable thing to do. It’s actually, like, really hard to make music with other people. I mean, again, maybe that does go without saying. It’s hard sort of emotionally, and it’s hard sort of in a way of—it’s hard to motivate yourself. And it’s just this vulnerable sort of like, weird—I don’t know—sort of thing that we and other musicians constantly put ourselves out there in this weird world to do. Because we believe in it. I guess a lot of the things happening around Spotify started to feel like—it honestly just made me and the others like not going to work, right?

And I love work. Like, work to me isn’t this bad word. Work is awesome. Work is great. I want to go to work, you know? I want to make stuff. And all this shit made me not want to go to work. And, you know, we had a lot of conversations with a lot of other musicians who I love and admire, and some of my other mates left Spotify. I just thought, Man, that’s … I don’t know. For some reason, it wasn’t something that I really thought of being possible. It also sounds like you just spend so much time thinking about music and working on the music, and Spotify is the platform that most people listen to it on. And then a few of our mates left. And I just thought—I didn’t even really think about that as an option.

Warzel: I’ve been having this conversation for a couple of years with a number of artists and musicians, especially. And I was talking, to prepare for this, to another musician. Who’s honestly done really well for themselves, very popular, and mentioned that the Spotify stuff—especially the algorithmic-discovery stuff—had just ground them down so much creatively. Like, basically had said: I—use the same terms of work, right—I consider this to be work. I consider when I got to get through, you know, like I’m problem-solving, right? Like, it’s not all fun and games. It’s like my job sometimes. And I’m not afraid to grind through it and do that.

And then there was this feeling recently that they weren’t able to stop. Which was like, I’m going through all this, like, preparing this beautiful meal, right? And I have this total worry that this thing that I have no control over is just going to stop people from coming to my restaurant. Right? Even if they like the food all the time, they’re just going to forget that the restaurant exists. Right? For some kind of weird reason. And this idea also that songwriting is for them this craft: this thing that they love to do, right? And that it’s become sort of … it’s gone from the skill game to this slot-machine game, right? And if you’re thinking about the casino: Really good blackjack players don’t want to spend time at the slots, because the slots are stupid and they’re arbitrary, right? And that’s how it felt fighting for people’s attention. It was a really interesting feeling, though. That it’s got that similar thing of like—it’s just making coming to work feel juiceless, or bad.

Mackenzie: Yeah. And that’s interesting to hear you say that, because I do think there are a lot of analogous sort of—that’s happening in so many industries at the moment, in different ways. And I feel like I can kind of talk about it from my perspective of being a musician. I feel like I have conflicting ideas about it. I feel like I almost open my mouth to say something and I stop myself, because it’s hard to sort of form a fully thought-out opinion on a lot of this stuff. Because it’s still happening. And, again with technology, there are certain elements of a lot of the AI or generative things that I look at, and I’m like, Fuck, that is so cool. That is fucking amazing that that shit is possible.

Warzel: To democratize some of this. To give people some of the tools, some of the ability to say, like, I see this, I feel this, and I want to make this for myself. Right? That is like going back to the first principles of all of this stuff, the way that humans did it before it was professionalized. And yet, if you do reduce it to: Hey man, I want to do this, and I can do it now because I can write out a prompt and push a button, that’s fine on a creative-explosion scale, right? It’s not fine probably in the sense of: I wanna use your guys’ style of music, and I wanna fit it into a Spotify playlist and then, you know, just ride off the back of you guys no longer having your music on Spotify. Right? Because, like, that’s an example of something that’s happened to you guys, right? You have people who are kind of like, yeah. People are coming in, and—

Mackenzie: That really happened. And I totally agree. And it’s something that I’ve talked about, as well. And I think where I landed was: We are doomed. It does feel like we are fucking doomed when that shit happens. It’s like, what do you do about that? This ship has, like, well and truly sailed. I mean, it is totally wack to be able to train the algorithm on artists’ work. Totally wack. Like totally cooked. Totally fucking horrible.

And it’s just—I can’t believe that that has just happened. And it’s like, Whoops, didn’t mean to do that. Shit, okay. Oh well, that happened now. Let’s just move on. What? That’s crazy. That’s why it feels like we’re doomed.

Warzel: Can you describe for me how it happened? How you found out about this? Because essentially, right, what happened was: You guys took the music off of Spotify, and people were just coming in with, like, ringtone-style stuff. Is that how it went down?

Mackenzie: I don’t know how people are making this shit. It’s like, honestly, when I listen to these King Gizzard, sort of, AI-artist songs, they’re insanely funny to me. Because it’s so dark and so twisted and so strange. And it’s so weird that it’s happening to us. All I can do is laugh. It’s insanely funny, but in the most twisted and dark way. It’s just … my reaction is to laugh, but it’s very dark and very weird and very 2026. But basically, to anyone that doesn’t know, we took our music off Spotify. And then, tons of music has just been—it’s probably there now—stuff has been taken down. More songs come up. And I suppose, because our artist page must still exist, or maybe you can still search for it, I don’t know—but it means that if someone is looking for King Gizzard, it’s very easy for them to find this stuff. And actually, there is a very weird problem where you can actually upload music impersonating another artist and go onto their official profile very easily. That’s a whole other thing. It’s super easy to impersonate another artist and end up on their official profile. And this has happened to tons of artists.

Warzel: Have you talked to Spotify about this at all? Or have people on your guys’ behalf?

Mackenzie: Yeah, quite a few times. And they’re—quite a few times—and they are always just like, Oh, whoops; we’ll take it down. And they do take it down. But, you know, there’s more up there before you know it. And it’s not just us. It’s happening to tons of artists. It’s a story, actually. I think it’s just exacerbated this whole thing, because it’s left a hole. So when I’m talking about these, like, AI King Gizzard tracks, they are on our profile. Like, it’s King Gizzard. It’s not someone else. It’s, like, “us,” that’s the weird thing—but it’s not us. It’s just … I don’t fucking know. It’s just—yeah, it’s weird.

Warzel: But what’s so interesting is you all leaving Spotify. It sounds a little bit like, you know, it hasn’t been that hard for you guys. Is that correct?

Mackenzie: I suppose so. And I would want to preface it with, you know, I don’t see us as necessarily being a model for other people to follow. Because I know that we exist on a very unusual path, and I’m very proud of that. But I’m not sitting here saying … I don’t want to sit here and say, “Everybody should leave Spotify.” And if people want to do that, that’s cool. But I’m not here to pontificate on anything, actually. That’s not my vibe.

But for us, we have had nothing but quite beautiful press around that, and around leaving Spotify. And I think quite a lot of people have discovered our music. Because with all of this, the hardest part about leaving Spotify is making your music inaccessible to so many people who listen to music only on Spotify. And that doesn’t feel good. Like, I don’t want to do that. Nothing about that is what I like about what we’re doing. But it felt like the right price. And that’s okay. And I am proud of doing it. But it does feel like people [are] maybe taking notice of what we’re doing, as well. Yeah; it’s cool.

Warzel: I wanted to just end with—it’s easy to get bummed out about some of this stuff when you’re talking about technology and art and all that. Is there stuff that makes you feel optimistic? About—maybe you can just speak for yourself and not for the world and art and creativity. But for you going forward, do you feel like some of this technology, some of this stuff, some of just the explosion of information that you can access, that that’s going to be generative for you, as you continue to evolve as an artist?

Mackenzie: I remember when—like a few years ago now, and I’m sure there are many people listening to this who have had a similar experience—when ChatGPT first came in. And a few people were like, You should try this thing; it’s like pretty freaky. And I was like, Okay, cool. And I started writing in just the most batshit prompts, like, You are a grain of dust traveling through the fucking cosmos. Explain to me what you see along the way. Stuff like that. That just felt so new. And there was a time when I was like, Wow, this feels so inspiring. I feel like this is actually doing something new. I’m sure this is what it felt like when someone first used the thesaurus to write, to help write poetry or something. Imagine if you’d never used a thesaurus, and then you just picked up one. And you’re like, Whoa; this is going to make my writing so much easier!

Mackenzie: Yeah, right? I was thinking about a lot of things like that. All these things we kind of take for granted that were new technology at some point. But I don’t feel very interested in that now.

Warzel: There’s an interesting interview that Brian Eno did earlier, I guess last year, talking about this kind of stuff. Brian Eno is someone who’s created so much generative music and so much ambient out there, and pushed the boundaries of this electronic music and stuff. He was talking about playing around with ChatGPT and this idea that when you first start using it, there is that feeling of, Whoa, like: This did something different. And then he was saying the more times he started to do it, the less interesting it got to him. And he had this great word for it, which is, like—he used to do watercolor painting. And when he would put the brush in the water between the different things, no matter what happened, no matter what colors he was using, the water at the end of the thing would be this weird sort of maroonish-purple. And he called it—munge was the color. And he was like: That’s ChatGPT. The output is munge. Like, No matter what I do, it always kind of comes back to this kind of drab sort of soulless mix of all the stuff. And I thought that that was kind of like a perfect summation of maybe why that kind of stuff is not all that interesting to you right now.

Mackenzie: Maybe. Yeah, that’s a very funny take. And yeah, I definitely relate to that. I’m not sure I ever got really, really, really deep, or I really got to know ChatGPT’s personality. But I do know that it has a personality. And I do know that it’s what, like, a good percentage of the world is using. And that—to me, as an artist—is not interesting to engage with right now. At least not in the kind of music that we’re making.

That moment that I was talking about—when I first did use ChatGPT, and it kind of did blow my mind—it actually felt niche at that time. It felt like something that my parents, for instance, wouldn’t have known about. It was at that point, whatever that point was—a lot of it does come back to kind of what I was saying earlier. And I just want to do what makes me want to go to work. And what makes me kind of excited to just get out of bed and race into my studio and make music. Like: That’s what makes me want to pick up the phone and call one of the other guys in the band and say, Be at the studio at nine o’clock in the morning. Like, Let’s go; I’ve got these ideas. I just want to put myself in that head space.

I wonder if this is like when the drum machine came out? Or, I wonder whether it is not like that at all. You know, when the drum machine came out and people thought, I miss real drummers. I miss real drummers, with all that beautiful feel and all their imperfections. And, you know, I could tell the difference between this drummer and that drummer just by hearing them on record. And all those things are true. And then, you know, so much amazing music came out of that. And a ton of this wall of senses is drum machines.

Warzel: I think it’s all a cycle, right? That’s the only way that I can kind of keep it all in my head, because I think we all as humans tend to do that “It’s so over; we’re so back; it’s so over; we’re so back” kind of thing. And instead of being completely doom and gloom about it, or dismissing it as nothing, right, I think it’s a part of this cycle. I think there—as with something like a drum machine—you get to do different things and manipulate it in all these different capacities. And kind of push the bounds of something, right? And there’s a lot of creativity and interesting, like, wall-breaking there. And at the same time, too, I think you sacrifice. You pay the price of a little bit of that humanity, or a little bit of that, you know, spice-of-life type thing. And then people, if you go too far in one direction, eventually I think people start yearning for the other thing.

What I find really inspiring about what you guys have charted out for yourselves is that it feels like there’s a real focus on the humanity part of it. On the human element, on like the drive for the new thing. The creative push. And I think that that is what a lot of people are craving more and more these days.

Mackenzie: Yeah; that’s interesting. And I appreciate that. I think with what we have done in our career, in a lot of ways, we have not been very tactical about anything. And we have made decisions from the gut; we definitely have just tried to prioritize doing things in real life with real people. And that’s, yeah—the obvious stuff, like playing shows and stuff like that. But also just, like, meeting people and talking to people and just being a real person. Like, I would pride myself on being pretty ordinary in a lot of ways. And I think that’s cool.

Warzel: As an ordinary person, I totally agree. Man, I so appreciate this conversation. And, you know, grounding it in the humanity and the real-personness of all that. I think we need more of that. So I appreciate all of this and the insights. And all the time, man.

Mackenzie: Cheers, Charlie. I am grateful for the chat, and the reflection and the inwardness. And the, yeah—it’s just good to talk about this stuff before we go insane.

Warzel: That’s the whole point of this podcast. Talk about it before we go insane. Not so we don’t go insane, but just before we do it, you know?

Warzel: Thanks again, man. I appreciate it.

Mackenzie: Cheers, Charlie. Thanks, mate.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, Thomas E. Dans, the recently appointed chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, showed up unexpectedly in Tromsø, Norway, at an annual conference about the Arctic’s future. He had flown in from Mar-a-Lago and, he told me, was there to observe. The next day, he watched as Åsa Rennermalm, a Rutgers University professor who studies polar regions, sat onstage with European foreign ministers and spoke out against cuts to U.S. science funding.

“A leading US Arctic scientist is on stage absolutely ripping her country to the delight of the audience,” Dans wrote on X. “Embarrassing.” He punctuated his post with an American-flag emoji.

When I asked him at the conference about his plans in his new job—the commission’s main function is advising the federal government on what Arctic science to pursue—he said that future research will put America first and focus on the economic opportunities of the north. In a later email, he emphasized investments in Arctic military and energy security. “Under President Trump, our expansive Arctic research enterprise, across the entirety of the U.S. government enterprise, is increasing not decreasing,” he wrote.

But his comments were also consistent with the Trump administration’s posture toward Arctic climate research in particular: The United States has been doing too much of it. The Trump administration’s choices are leading to an odd predicament, in that the more the U.S. takes a geopolitical interest in the Arctic, the less it’s contributing to the world’s basic understanding of the region. By slashing any science related to climate change, the U.S. is willfully remaining ignorant about the place key to the world’s future.

In the past year, the government’s own scientists, as well as scientists who depended on federal funding, have had to leave the region in droves, while thousands of federal data sets have vanished without warning, including many key to climate research. One day last May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the Sea Ice Index, a nearly half-century-long archive kept by one of its centers, would no longer be maintained or updated. In December, when NOAA quietly published its 20th-anniversary Arctic Report Card, it not only detailed record-high temperatures and record-low winter sea-ice cover, but also indexed the report’s own at-risk projects, threatened by U.S. staffing and budget cuts—including, for instance, a sea-ice-monitoring satellite system already scheduled for decommission.

Not long ago, the U.S. was the world’s greatest public funder of Arctic research, and the most frequent research-project initiator, according to an analysis by UArctic, a network of universities and research institutions studying the high north. “Frighteningly, a lot of the world’s critical climate data is being stored in data centers in the U.S.,” Morven Muilwijk, an oceanographer at the Norwegian Polar Institute who studies sea ice, told me. Scientists around the world have been scrambling to fill in gaps and make space on their servers for American data sets, before more of them suddenly disappear.

Polar peace, and the scientific collaboration it’s enabled, is a relatively recent idea; the eight Arctic nations created the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) in 1991, at the Cold War’s end. More than a decade later, AMAP published the first ever international and multidisciplinary report on Arctic climate change and its driving role in planetary warming. At its height, AMAP grew to a network involving more than 800 global scientists and experts.

Arctic research always required diplomacy, and even before Donald Trump took office, it had been in a rough stretch. In March 2022, one week after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Western nations started issuing sanctions against Russia that limited cross-border science and data-sharing, effectively wiping half of the geographical Arctic from climate models. The Arctic Council, the diplomatic forum that directs AMAP, paused its work. Practically overnight, hundreds of projects were halted, and once-daily contact among colleagues ceased. Scientists co-signed editorials pleading with their governments to end the sanctions for the sake of tracking planetary change. Only in mid-2024 did AMAP shakily open conversations about how to resume data-sharing.

Rolf Rødven, AMAP’s executive secretary, told me that today he’s optimistic and that the “intentions are there on both sides” to reopen the data channels. Still, he noted that, in recent years, attitudes toward data-sharing have changed. All environmental data shared across borders have the potential to be used for civilian technology or for military purposes. For example, high-resolution permafrost maps are key to understanding Arctic changes, but also reveal strategic details about a country’s terrain. In 2024, a Newsweek investigation found that a Chinese atmospheric station on Svalbard was using instruments owned by a state military-electronics group, which is also known for developing radar that can spot submarines and missiles at great distances. Just this week, The Barents Observer reported that a Russian AMAP scientist was arrested in January, accused of state treason by security services who say they found information in his publications on the Arctic environment that could be used by Norwegian intelligence. According to the First Report, a group of Russian human-rights lawyers in exile, the scientist has denied the charges.

Given the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to Arctic politics, any wariness about continuing to share data would be unsurprising. But not even American scientists can access the decades-long data sets they’ve removed, nor is it clear that those data sets exist anymore. To Rødven, “the U.S. situation is much worse” than the 2022 breakdown in Russian science collaboration. Russia is still collecting key data, even if other countries can’t currently access the information. The Trump administration has been planning to pull carbon-measuring satellites out of the sky. European institutions are now preparing for a future without American data: The Norwegian Meteorological Institute, for example, has been downloading still-online NOAA and NASA data sets to its own servers; the European Space Agency, Muilwijk said, “is really stepping up” with its satellite data sets. But these efforts may not be enough to patch the holes the U.S. is leaving behind.

Late last year, at the American Geophysical Union’s annual conference, Rennermalm, the Rutgers scientist, gave a talk titled “The End of the Golden Era of Polar and Cryosphere Science in the United States?” In it, she raised concerns that the administration’s disinvestments could seriously hurt the global understanding of the poles, and discourage an entire generation of young researchers. At the conference, one of the most important gatherings for climate research, she noticed that fewer attendees had come from outside the U.S. than she’d expected, she told me. Scientists from other countries—Muilwijk and his colleagues among them—have started skipping American conferences. They’ve also stopped submitting to American academic journals, Muilwijk told me, in part because as available American peer reviewers shrink, these journals are running monthslong backlogs. The U.S. continues to pull away from international collaboration, too: In January, the Trump administration formally announced that it would withdraw the United States from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, just two years before initial reports from its next comprehensive, meticulous account of planetary changes and forecasts are due to be published.

The impact of losing American involvement in the IPCC report is difficult to quantify. But one consequence is fairly straightforward: The National Center for Atmospheric Research, which the Trump administration wants to dismantle entirely, produces a major model of the Earth system that the report depends on. NCAR has been a leader in improving the accuracy of climate predictions, Muilwijk told me. The science has been moving toward linking Arctic changes to other regions and predicting hyperlocal impacts—future storms, erosion, sea-level rise—with greater specificity. Losing NCAR models and data may make those predictions a lot harder. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment.)

Rennermalm took what she thinks may be her final research trip to Greenland last summer. She’s been studying changes to the ice sheet there for two decades, during which it has lost 5,000 billion tons of ice, and at a research station that was once full of American scientists, she saw only two other senior researchers like herself, “there to pack down the science,” she told me. At the harbor, she could see naval ships. “This Greenland-occupation rhetoric is now a world issue consuming every conversation,” she said, when I called three weeks before the Tromsø conference, “when what we should be focusing on is what’s happening to our Earth system and our ability to live on this planet.”

That’s what happened at the conference, too—an exchange between Dans and Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of the Danish Parliament, became the talk of the week. Dans had just given an interview to Norwegian national TV, in which he expounded on America’s designs on Greenland. Afterward, when his mic was still on, he glibly told Chemnitz that the “check is in the mail.” The next night Chemnitz recounted the whole exchange at a talk with, among others, Michael Sfraga, who chaired the U.S. Arctic Research Commission under Joe Biden; he told Chemnitz to “rip the check up.” (In his email, Dans told me that he’d encourage people to listen to the full interview, and that “Greenlanders themselves deserve better and they have no greater friend in America.”)

When I spoke with Sfraga about the exchange, he said that “it’s getting harder to stay measured in my reactions.” But he noted that in mid-January, Congress passed a bipartisan bill restoring much of the climate-science funding cut from NOAA, NASA, and the National Science Foundation last year. And even an administration pursuing an “America First” strategy in the Arctic should see some value in investing in polar science. “You can not divorce basic research from national security, homeland security, energy security, community security, or economic security,” Sfraga told me. Whatever U.S. leaders might think about climate change, that reality will affect their future plans, too.</div>

            <h2>Matt Lauer’s Accuser Complicates Her Story</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/matt-lauers-accuser-complicates-her-story/685989/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is the story that has been most commonly told about Brooke Nevils: While she was on assignment for NBC at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the Today show host Matt Lauer joined her and his co-host Meredith Vieira at their hotel bar for drinks. Afterward, she ended up in Lauer’s room. There, she later alleged, he took advantage of their power imbalance and her inebriation to pressure her into nonconsensual sex. In 2017 she reported him to NBC; the network fired Lauer, their $20-million-a-year star anchor. News outlets later revealed other complaints against him. Lauer repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and in a 2019 letter, he asserted that their relationship was consensual and said, “I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period.”

That’s the summary that quickly spread across tabloids and celebrity-news sites. Now Nevils has offered a more expanded account, one that she believes could help an observer gain some understanding of what might have happened in one of the most high-profile cases of the #MeToo era. But her new memoir, Unspeakable Things: Silence, Shame, and the Stories We Choose to Believe, also aims to complicate the story. Nevils agreed to go to Lauer’s hotel room, she writes, in part because she wanted to delete unflattering photos he’d taken of her at the bar. She woke up the next day, she writes, crusted in blood. She recalls that she did not “say no or stop” when Lauer took off her jeans, and eventually “gave up” when he asked for anal sex. Why? As a personal assistant to on-air talent, she says she had learned to “ignore so many basic personal boundaries,” to “do things you don’t personally want to do” and “pretend to enjoy things you do not personally enjoy.” She visited Lauer in New York afterward several times, and had further sexual encounters, she writes, because she wanted to avoid being “a victim” and instead become “a master” of her own fate.

For all of these allegations, Unspeakable Things is less a bombshell than a bomb squad—it wants to carefully separate the wires, to parse and defuse the inner machinery of this kind of scandal. Just as much an investigator as a memoirist, Nevils attempts to tunnel through the lurid details and the #MeToo boilerplate and unearth something much knottier. &quot;My purpose here,&quot; she writes in a note at the beginning of the book, “is not to demand that you believe my side of the story without question, but instead to ask that you question all sides of your own beliefs about sexual harassment and assault.”

To that end, Nevils takes on several roles at once. She’s a seasoned journalist who brings to her book the research of more than 20 forensic psychologists, memory experts, scientists, attorneys, and authorities on sexual trauma. She sees herself as a sacrificial lamb, offering her own version of the story 12 years later, to provoke essential new conversations despite layers of pain. And she’s an accidental student, who began learning about sexual-assault myths in the psych ward where she spent 10 days after coming forward. Her big lesson? That rape and sexual-assault victims are more likely than not to behave in ways that would confound the average person, that stories that defy “common sense” are actually the norm, and that the jurors and journalists who weigh in on these cases do not have the full picture. All of this makes Unspeakable Things a particular type of #MeToo memoir, one in which the accuser implicates herself—not as complicit in any assault or harassment, but as fully human, and sometimes confounding even to herself.

Read: Everything we know about rape is wrong

Nevils lays out a variety of her own actions, during and after the event, that might baffle anyone who thinks they already understand the contours of #MeToo. When Lauer leaned to open the door to his room after their first encounter, she writes, she misread his body movements and hugged him. When he first kissed her, she admits, “even sober, I would have been flattered.” When he acted coldly toward her afterward, she worried that he was mad at her—and that the anger of “the Most Powerful Face in News” might tank her career—so she quickly tried to assure him, she writes, that she wouldn’t “be a problem.” For years after the incident, she says she told “sanitized” versions of the story, hinting that the two had had some kind of affair. She didn’t report it until a moment when many powerful men were being accused of terrible misdeeds.

After Nevils shares her own version of events, she shifts gears to offer a more general, though quite nuanced, education about sexual-assault myths. As one prominent researcher of violence against women tells her, “rape myths and common sense are the same thing.” (Nevils expresses discomfort with the term rape, though she uses it when discussing research.) She writes that women are often unlikely to behave as you might expect—to scream, to run, to call a friend, to use the word rape, to ask for a rape kit, to blame their attacker. Instead they might freeze, minimize the incident, avoid turning their body into a crime scene, revisit their attacker in an attempt to smooth things over. Just as rapists don’t all fit the image of, as Nevils puts it, “a man in a ski mask,” survivors do not necessarily act in preordained ways. As the forensic psychologist Veronique Valliere succinctly explained in her book Understanding Victims of Interpersonal Violence: “Victims do not expect to be attacked, so have no plan.” What they have instead is a series of instinctual responses to a wounding they might prefer to forget.

Nevils shares startling data to support these expert testimonies. The forensic psychiatrist Barbara Ziv, for instance, estimates that only about 30 percent of women fight back when being sexually assaulted by a stranger. Somewhere from 19 to 32 percent of victims have consensual sex with the perpetrator after an assault, according to a 2022 meta-analysis. And a study by Valliere found that “in 83 percent of cases, the people close to the offenders believed in their innocence, even when the offenders confessed or were caught in the act.”

With all of this in mind, Nevils regards the doubt that many people might feel about her story with a kind of forbearance bordering on the anthropological. In 2019, she spoke with the journalist Ronan Farrow for his book Catch and Kill, which investigated Harvey Weinstein, among others. After an excerpt of his book was leaked, she recalls, she “looked again and again at the comments online and asked myself—had none of this happened to me and I read these allegations, would I have believed me? I knew the answer was no. Even now, with everything I’ve learned, I still understand the hesitation.”

Although Unspeakable Things is a diary about the loss of control—after Sochi, Nevils began drinking heavily—it’s also an attempt to regain it. Nevils knows better than most the way that women in her position can be turned into paper dolls—flattened figures that are then covered up with flimsy constructions. She supplies a third dimension by dragging the reader, as she puts it, “into someone else’s ugly, irreconcilable conflict,” and then explaining why it looks so messy. The reader of Unspeakable Things isn’t being asked to play judge and jury, but to reexamine everything they think they know about sexual assault.

As Nevils explained in one recent interview, she now uses her husband’s last name, has left New York, and no longer works in television. If she hadn’t written this book, she might have been able to elude the tabloids, and the long arm of online search results, for the rest of her life. But Nevils is doing more than just unburdening herself. She is actually building scaffolding that other accusers—or anyone, really—can use to understand their own personal narratives. With that kind of structure, it might be possible to clamber up, take a look around, and see oneself from an unexpected point of view.

            <h2>Most People Don’t Have a ‘Type’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By the time I met Rich, I had whittled my list of must-haves for a romantic partner down to two: He must be Jewish, and he must have a permanent address.

He didn’t clear even this low bar. I’m not sure what made me fall for the Gentile giant who was crashing, as a “stopgap measure between things,” on the couch of my group house. But, reader, I married him.

This is not an uncommon trajectory. Many people think that they have a set type, and that all they need for eternal bliss is to find someone who matches it. When people peruse dating profiles, they’re often looking for someone who has specific interests, qualities, or hobbies. But according to a growing body of relationship research, many people end up marrying someone with few of their must-haves and a lot of “haves” they didn’t think they desired. A person might say that they’re looking for a partner who’s funny and conscientious, but then end up in a happy relationship with someone who is neither of those things. “People don’t know what they want,” Samantha Joel, a psychologist at Western University in Ontario who studies relationships, told me, “and people don’t know what they’re going to like until they meet someone.”

Across many studies, people’s stated preferences don’t align well with the traits that incite their fondness for someone in real life. In a 2020 study, the UC Davis psychologist Paul Eastwick and his colleagues asked participants to list some ideal characteristics they wanted in a partner, and then sent them on a blind date. The researchers later asked the participants how closely the person they went out with had reflected both their own ideals and a list of someone else’s. People turned out to be just as romantically interested in a date who met the other person’s must-haves as they were in a date who met all of their own. “You are happy with somebody who fits your ideals,” Eastwick told me, “but you would have been just as happy with what your friend ordered off the menu.” This is where apps can fall short in terms of quality matchmaking. As Eastwick writes in his new book, Bonded by Evolution, compatibility can’t be determined by a dating profile; it has to be “curated, cultivated, and constructed”—usually as the relationship unfolds.

Even some “deal-breakers” may not end up breaking the deal. In one study by Joel, researchers told subjects that a hypothetical romantic partner had a trait that they said they wanted to avoid—poor hygiene, say, or anger issues—and many people said that they would continue to date the prospect anyway. Joel said that this inclination would likely be even stronger “in the context of a real relationship, where there’s feelings involved.”

That said, shared values do seem to matter to people: A 2020 report found that only 3 percent of American adults were married to someone from the opposite political party, for instance. Eastwick says that this happens because so many people either immediately screen out or simply never interact with a potential date who has opposing values—a hard-core Democrat might live in a neighborhood populated mostly with other Democrats, for example, or swipe left on all Republicans on Tinder. But if two people get together not knowing that they’re political opposites and the relationship takes off for other reasons, they might compartmentalize their differences or move closer to each other’s ideology. (“He’s probably going to become a libertarian,” Eastwick said, referring to the hypothetical Republican.)

Physical attraction matters, too—far more than most people realize, according to the researchers I spoke with. (Taylor Swift has it right when she sings, “Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot.”) If two people in a relationship are lucky, infatuation will set in: an obsessionlike mental state in which you find yourself thinking about the person a lot, noticing them, and wanting to be physically close to them. Once that initial spark ignites, motivated reasoning—essentially, seeing what you want to see—takes over. Joel theorized that people are prone to a “progression bias” in relationships: They are more inclined to encourage a relationship to continue than they are to dissolve it. Merely spending time together makes people become more invested in making a relationship work. “Once you like someone,” Joel said, “you want to see the best in them.” After Rich and I started dating, I began to notice his sharp and twisted sense of humor. Once while impersonating an old person trying to use Twitter, he called tweets “a telegram about yourself.” Is this the funniest thing ever? Not really. But in my eyes, at that moment, it was.

This kind of self-delusion is a good thing. Everyone, to some extent, grades their romantic partner on a curve, and relationships in which partners are especially inclined to do this may be particularly strong. In one study that Eastwick cites in his book, the longest-lasting relationships were the ones in which people justified their partner’s faults with “yes, but” statements such as “She is messy, but I wouldn’t ask her to give up her free-­spirited ways for anything.”

The problem is: The way people actually become attracted to each other can be hard to predict, Joel said. Not even scientists who have dedicated their life to studying chemistry can totally pin down its essence. Do you like the guy from Tinder and the joke he cracked about The Big Lebowski just because you were in an unusually good mood on the day you met up with him? If you’d been in a rotten mood, would you have liked him (and his stupid joke) less? I’m not sure I would have given Rich a second glance if he had not walked by my room in the group house one day while I was listening to “Portions for Foxes,” by Rilo Kiley, and exclaimed, “This is one of my favorite songs ever.” No man had ever complimented my taste in music before. It felt so refreshing—and well, kinda hot.

All of this might help explain why many people who use dating apps struggle to find a long-term partner. With their emphasis on photos and profiles, Eastwick writes, “apps cater to our ideas about what we like much better than they cater to what we actually like.” Chemistry grows, and love is built on shared experiences and memories, but the apps tend to keep people trapped in small talk. Many users find themselves swiping endlessly without ever meeting up with someone. What’s more, Eastwick told me, apps can encourage people to judge their dates too quickly—and perhaps move on prematurely. “You might have a middling first impression of somebody,” he said, “but then you meet them again, and you end up really liking them.” The apps, however, present so many options that if a date is “anywhere south of great,” people may be inclined to hastily decide “I’m not gonna do the second date.”

The better way to find love, Eastwick suggested, is to get to know romantic prospects in person, over time. “Compatibility,” he said, “is about what you’re able to create together.” He recommended building deep friendship networks—both because those friends can introduce you to singles they know and because some of them might become romantic partners. But regardless of how you meet people, the crucial pieces are: Find someone you think is reasonably attractive and then hang out with them at least three times, doing things together that will inspire deep, connection-building interactions (such as playing a conversation card game and maybe answering the “36 Questions That Lead to Love” from that old New York Times essay). The person you spark with might be too tall or too short, or be a dog person to your cat person, or have an extremely boring job. Even so: They might be just your type.</div>

            <h2>Putin Didn’t Know How Good He Had It</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against the world that the United States built after the Cold War. In his account, an international order run by a single power would hinder Russia and produce needless conflict, especially when that power was as self-serving and duplicitous as America.

Now Donald Trump is dismantling the order that Putin had so long abhorred, and a new multipolar world is emerging in its place. Putin had thought he could rise to the top of such a system, in which raw economic and military might outweigh diplomacy and alliances. But he was mistaken: The norms and institutions of the postwar order actually masked Russia’s vulnerabilities. Putin has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.

Moscow had assumed that its immense nuclear arsenal, unparalleled natural resources, and extensive territory in the heart of Eurasia would keep Russia competitive with China and the United States. But these assets have been unable to slow its rapid decline. Russia’s economy is at best one-quarter the size of China’s and America’s, and the gap is growing. Meanwhile, it risks becoming an afterthought in the race for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. The country’s economy and technology base are even slowly losing ground to India’s.

To make the case that his power is still secure, Putin has touted a wide-ranging strategic partnership with China, which Russia has tried to strengthen particularly since 2022. But the relationship has fallen short of his expectations. Bilateral trade increased at first, but it now appears to have plateaued. China has invested little in Russia’s economy, and nowhere near the amount that the West withdrew after Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Because Russia has few other major trading partners, China seems empowered to drive hard bargains: Negotiations on energy deals—one, called Power of Siberia 2, would bring Russian natural gas to China—have stalled because Moscow hasn’t been able to get Beijing to cover enough of the costs.

Read: Putin and Xi are holding the West together

The war in Ukraine has only deepened Russia’s disadvantages. Before February 2022, some observers thought Russia was one of the world’s premier military powers—an assessment that Ukraine quickly upended. The conflict has now dragged on longer than the Soviet Union’s campaign against Nazi Germany, and it has resulted in more than 1 million Russian casualties, exacerbating the country’s chronic demographic crisis. Even if Putin is able to seize additional territory, most of it will be shelled-out cities and deserted land. Reconstructing it would require billions of dollars that Russia does not have and is unlikely to receive from others.

As Putin continues to pour resources into the war, he is hemorrhaging international support and influence. Russia’s long-standing partners in Syria and Venezuela have been swept out of power. Meanwhile, former Soviet states have reoriented away from Moscow and toward Western countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to Trump to resolve a simmering dispute over a transportation corridor. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are strengthening their ties with Washington. Moldova has accelerated its political shift toward Europe. Putin believed that the end of the U.S.-led order would help him consolidate power in the former Soviet space. But Russia has been too weak and ineffective to take advantage.

Putin also assumed that a multipolar world would free him from American interference. And indeed, Trump has accommodated Moscow in some ways. His conciliation does not, however, extend to Russia’s energy sector, the foundation of its economy: Last fall, Trump levied wide-ranging sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two largest oil producers. The U.S. has also ramped up enforcement against shadow tankers, threatening a primary channel that Russia has used to sidestep sanctions on its oil sales. Trump’s plans to revive Venezuela’s petroleum sector might likewise hurt Russia. Executing those plans may prove more complicated than Trump anticipates, but they could drive Russia’s oil prices below what its federal budget can sustain.

Moscow is at the mercy of an American president who circumvents traditional channels of power and obliterates the constraints that once regulated their use. For example, Trump could attempt to use his recently constituted Board of Peace to bypass the United Nations Security Council—and Russia’s veto—and muscle through his preferred policy in the Middle East, eroding Moscow’s influence in the region. Thanks to decisions by both Trump and Putin, moreover, the two powers no longer have any functional arms-control agreements. Without these, Trump could choose to accelerate his “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which Russia fears could undermine its own nuclear deterrence.

Trump’s disdain for international alliances and norms has also begun to reshape Europe in a way that may exacerbate Russia’s weakness. As U.S. security assurances wane, European countries are developing their hard-power capabilities. Germany has committed 100 billion euros to modernize its military, and Poland is building up its armed forces with a goal of amassing 300,000 troops. Putin has long wanted to split the U.S. and Europe. But he might soon find that the continent—which collectively dwarfs Russia in population and wealth—poses a significant challenge even if it doesn’t belong to a U.S.-dominated alliance.

Shortly before becoming president in 2000, Putin issued a manifesto explaining how Russia could keep from falling into the second or third rank of world powers. He insisted that America’s global leadership was holding Moscow back. In reality, he didn’t know how good he had it.</div>

On the AI front, CoPilot is not even #1.  There is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, AskPerplexity and a whole host of others.  And many are just better

Unlike in 2000, Microsoft is no longer in a position where they can extend, embrace and extinguish their competition

I think there will be a number of opportunities for companies to profit from the removal of the rules for as long as the rules are gone. For example, manufacturers may turn to cheaper, high GHG feedstocks over the next couple of years.

In the end, this is being done by a bunch of old scared men shouting at the future, and they will die and leave the rest of us alone. But they can certainly make things shittier until they’re gone

At the end of the day, Congress should be legislating these types of regulations Absolutely. However, hyper-partisanship makes it impossible. Can you see GOP and Democrats finding common ground on this issue in 2026? Democrats are all-in on Net Zero and GOP wants to ban renewables. How can you reconcile these positions?

Apparently republicans no longer believe pollution is detrimental to their health.

How the fuck am I supposed to compromise on that?

Get them to suck some exhaust pipes if pollution is so harmless. Make it a bet or tell them it&#39;s the only way to really be macho and not gay or something. The problem should solve itself.

Apparently Democrats no long belive in having agriculture, industry, or transportation and want us all to subsistence starve to death to save the planet.How the fuck am I supposed to compromise on that?I must have missed all that legislation. Can you link to any?

By removing money from politicsI agree in context of Citizens United, that was catastrophically bad decision. However, how would you remove money from politics entirely? Money and political donations are not entirely the same thing.

the repeal in question is just about CO2 not NOx , particulates or unburned hydrocarbons.

NBC grudgingly gets to it on TFA on a single line about 2/3rds down after several breathless paragraphs.

&quot;&quot;&quot;The EPA will still regulate pollutants in tailpipe emissions that hamper air quality, such as carbon monoxide, lead and ozone.&quot;&quot;&quot;

Not sure that&#39;s true anymore. It seems like most of the non Maga GOP member are retiring or otherwise leaving office.

Congress wouldn&#39;t really change that, they&#39;ve also been in the control of the anti-sciencers for long periods of time over the last 20-30 years, including right now.

The problem we have is political, not structural. There are good, good, arguments for dramatically reducing the executive&#39;s power in certain areas, and in particular making it less of a role people are excited to run for (I favor changing it to a triumvirate, with elections for one member every two years, and rotating responsibilities) but that&#39;

...or maybe &quot;We the People&quot; need to start doing our job instead of electing politicians that care more about their own power than they do about the future of America.

We only had the choice between bad and worse.

That&#39;s not a good excuse to actively choose worse though.

So let Congress debate and vote on it.  Who&#39;s stopping them?  Problem is that they have plenty of items on their plate, so until they address something, the executive is at liberty to make its decision.  Let Congress debate that if it doesn&#39;t like what&#39;s happening

The rule change does not eliminate ability to regulate emissions.  It merely removes the ability to regulate greenhouse gases on the pretext that they harm health.  Emissions of particulates, sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, and other actual pollutants are unaffected, despite media morons claiming otherwise.

It merely removes the ability to regulate greenhouse gases on the pretext that they harm health. This is the dumbest statement I&#39;ve read today.

   CO2 and global warming are much more an economic issue than a &quot;health&quot; issue.  Congress can pass a law

The world&#39;s heads-of-government make up most of the rest.  But with less than 300 national heads-of-government and over 340 million Americans contributing to the world&#39;s hubris, it&#39;s easy to round to 100%.

It should now be called EDA, for Environmental Destruction Agency. Of course, that would necessitate new stationary, and the shredding or burning of the old stuff - an action which is perfectly aligned with their new mission.

It just so happened to be their own AI bot.

What the fuck is unfair?  If you don&#39;t like how they are using your service, stop them.  Cut them off, feed them garbage, get clever and solve the problem.

What are lawmakers going to do about it?  Order President Trump to nuke China?  More tariffs?  Sanctions on Russia?

It&#39;s also continually ironic that the companies that used the world&#39;s knowledge without compensation to train their models are complaining when another company uses their models to train models (though they almost certainly are paying for the privilege).

If only OpenAI had access to a giant computer brain that could analyze this problem and offer some solutions...

The big AI labs are also using sophisticated methods to avoid detection. This is one of the big drivers behind web-scraping botnets that run on residential IP addresses in crapwear and outright malware. Which in turn is why so many small websites are opting into DDoS protection services. Which in turn is why everyone is complaining about CAPTCHA interruptions everywhere they browse.

>  Next they will be interrogating humans in torture chambers to train their models. I&#39;m calling it now.

They already are. It&#39;s called &quot;social media.&quot;

Next they will be interrogating humans in torture chambers to train their models. I&#39;m calling it now.Given that the Web now runs on psychological manipulation, I would argue that they&#39;re already doing low-intensity interrogation in a mild-and-virtual torture chamber. All of us using the Web are experimental subjects. Many of us are suffering various degrees of pain and damage as a result; though most aren&#39;t aware of the fact.

For years, individuals, other companies, publishing industries across the board, and user groups have been fed the ever-loving fuck up with you stealing everything that isn&#39;t bolted down to train your fucked up vision of a future devoid of work, in a world that doesn&#39;t value humans when they don&#39;t work. And you and your ilk have proclaimed repeatedly that this is just the way things have to be, that the information belongs to you if it exists because you can access it. That there is no unfairness in you taking any information you can find because all information should go into training your new computer god.

And now that someone has done the exact fucking same god damned thing that you&#39;ve been doing all along, you whine about it like a spoiled fucking child that had one tiny piece of its candy taken from a pile of ever-expanding, continually self-replenishing candy that will never end and never could end.

Fuck you, you entitled pieces of god damned shit. Combine this with your future visions of completely disrupting society for your financial benefit, while potentially causing the entire economy to collapse whether your visions come true, or you crash out in your quest and take the entire dream-o-sphere of Wall Street with you, and you are beyond disgusting. We&#39;re sick of your shit, and I hope to crap that this begins to drive home the fact that the term &quot;corporation&quot; does not deserve the respect it gets in society today. You are a parasite, through and through. And just because you found a tapeworm within your shit, it doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t a tapeworm in society&#39;s shit yourself.

Good grief, some of us can&#39;t wait until you AI based companies stop being the 100% focal point of all world governments and all economic concerns. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve handed the reins of society over to the most narcissistic, self-obsessed idiots in all of existence, and somehow they always find a way to double-down on the ugliest parts of humanity in their quest.

You are a parasite, through and through. And just because you found a tapeworm within your shit, it doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t a tapeworm in society&#39;s shit yourself.I think the fundamental fact of the corporate sector&#39;s parasitism is a point which needs to be hammered home again and again. At some point maybe a majority of folks will consciously realize the specific ways in which we&#39;re all being fucked over. Then maybe an effective rebellion can begin. I live in hope...

I mean, look at who runs OpenAI and look at his affinities. It&#39;s ideologically and ethnically consistent with their behavior. What do you expect? They cry out as they strike you.

It&#39;s ideologically and ethnically consistent with their behavior.You pieces of shit really are getting bold, aren&#39;t you?

How is this any different than saying &quot;Black urban centers are riddled with violent crime and white people like destructive egalitarianism and uppers&quot; ? They&#39;re true.

They have no respect for the law or the wishes or creators. Now they want the other companies to be forced to respect those things? They can get fucked all day.

The video tape rental business solved this type of issue by billing customers if they returned a tape without rewinding it.

Add an extra charge to a fare if they don&#39;t properly close the door.  If the door won&#39;t close, they can report a fault to avoid the charge.  It&#39;ll cut down drastically on the need to hire third parties and completely avoid the need to add automatic door closure systems.

At the time, there were people who styled their hair to match Iceman (Val Kilmer with bleached short spiky hair), so presumably there was such a person behind in the line.

Top Gun was a fun movie for teenagers, of the &quot;if you take this at all seriously it will collapse under its own weight&quot; type.

Millennials are people born from 1980-1995 (give or take.) The vast majority have experience of video tapes, even if DVD was becoming a thing in the late 1990s (though DVDs didn&#39;t really take off to the point VHS started to be considered obsolete until the start of the millennium.)

It seems like a trivial problem to solve. Japanese taxis have had this for decades, a little button that opens and closes the door. Catches out many tourists.

Basically my own reaction was along these lines, though I think the driver can see if the door is clear before closing it. On the one hand I can imagine trying to do something similar for Waymo, but I still feel like you need a human in the loop to prevent vandalism that keeps the door from closing...

So here&#39;s the joke idea: The vandal blocks the first car with its door open and then attacks each of the other cars that come to help. Massacre of the robotaxis?

If only this could be solved with like a solenoid...

If only this could be solved with like a solenoid...It will in the future, per TFS:Future Waymo vehicles will have automated door closures.

Yeah, it&#39;s not quite the same, but I&#39;d like to think humans are not so universally stupid that leaving car doors open when they walk out of them is a widespread problem (unlike un-rewoundVHS rentals).

$10 is too little. A couple $25 fines and that&#39;ll likely solve the problem for those unusual individuals, especially if Waymo transfers most of that to the DoorDash driver.

The automotive industry solved this problem with self-closing doors. Waymo somehow didn&#39;t figure out that vehicles with this feature should be mandatory for a self-driving car service. This is stupidly obvious.

https://tech.slashdot.org/stor... [slashdot.org]

they&#39;ll run out of those 25 dollar bills fast...

i cannot for the life of me think back to a single instance where i forgot to shut the door to my car. are people actually forgetting or are they just being shitty?

i hope the passenger get a hefty surcharge.

I&#39;m really hoping it&#39;s a case of the door not closing completely - where it&#39;s held closed but the car&#39;s sensor still reports it as open.

But damn, Waymo. Why don&#39;t your cars have the ability to close its own doors, at the very least by human intervention from the warmth of an office after verifying the customer is long gone?

They likely didn&#39;t anticipate it, and it&#39;s probably so rare that retrofitting every existing car isn&#39;t worth it.

To me the question is how did they fail to anticipate it?

This reminds me of the software I use to do my work, where the devs have literally zero people who have ever done my job on staff, so they have only a vague third-hand clue what the software should actually do. They literally designed it initially to assume that everything was being done on time, and it malfunctioned when it wasn&#39;t.

Does Waymo have literally zero taxi drivers on staff, or at least on retainer as a consultant? Because any of them could

It must be very rare. Waymo has been operating fully autonomous since 2019 and prior to that in test mode with human drivers for years. The first I ever heard of this issue was some months ago. Maybe they did anticipate it, but figured it was so rare that it wasn&#39;t worth the extra capital expenditure per car. I&#39;m speculating of course. But logic dictates they would have been aware of this issue since at least 2020 if not earlier.

The first I ever heard of this issue was some months ago.It&#39;s so rare, even though they&#39;re not publicizing it you heard about it months ago, and now you&#39;re hearing about it again? That&#39;s not how those words work.

I see an article mentioning 450k rides per week for Waymo.  Something which happens once a day is quite rare but also common.  Large numbers are weird that way, and it&#39;s good evidence that beyond a thousand or so, people are bad at truly understanding large numbers.

As I understand it, this happens so rarely that even spending $500 on retro-fitting every car isn&#39;t justified.

My guess: the cost of holding up traffic even once, in goodwill if nothing else, makes it worth the cost of the $500 retrofit.

That&#39;s an easy fix, for new waymo cars. Next round of cars need to have autoshut doors and auto retracting seatbelts. So best would be to have cars with sliding doors.
Or retrofit current cars with motors to close the doors.An easy stop-gap measure would be for the car to tell passengers to &quot;please close the door fully when you leave the vehicle&quot;. I bet that simple voice message would eliminate the vast majority of left-open doors.The message could even be anticipated and reinforced by a reminder showing up in the app when the ride is booked.

An easy stop-gap measure would be for the car to tell passengers to &quot;please close the door fully when you leave the vehicle&quot;. I bet that simple voice message would eliminate the vast majority of left-open doors.

The message could even be anticipated and reinforced by a reminder showing up in the app when the ride is booked.

That simple notification will eliminate the rest, or at least would make sure nobody did it twice.

Can&#39;t wait for the opportunistic lawsuits &quot;the soulless self-driving car closed the door on my arm!  Gimme a $billion!&quot;  Sometimes the easy fixes are less easy than you think!

1. Become DoorDash driver, and follow Waymos when you see them2. Tell them to leave a door open (not ??????)ÂÂ. Split the profits!

Not everything needs to get a clean solution. One that works is often enough, especially when temporary.

I like this approach. It has a certain messy elegance.

there is always opportunity for more hierarchy

portable water guys -> service water guys -> drain and grey water guys -> sewage/waste water guys.

Future Waymo vehicles will have automated door closures.Given Waymo&#39;s excellent record at avoiding problems I&#39;m sure that will be trouble free.

So a human drive a car to an autonomous car to close its door.What is the point of autonomous driving really ?You can make  a car move autonomously but you cannot swing a door automatically, really ?

No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart  -anonAnon never shopped at Aldi or one of the other stores that makes you pay a deposit for a shopping cart.

Heck, for that, I&#39;d venture a guess that gangs will descent upon stores. Rolling carts out and then having an accomplice collect the return fee.

Why didn&#39;t Waymo tack an extra $11.25 fee onto the rider&#39;s bill for not closing the fucking door?

IIRC, Tokyo taxicabs have long had automatic door closers under the control of the driver. Waymo should consider using automation.

AI is going to take all the CS jobs anyway. Might as well bring back vocational programs in coal mining, considering all the energy these AI data centers will need.

Or most people simply don&#39;t have a need for computer science, even if their job is sitting at a computer all day, even if they might occasionally write an excel script. Plain old mathematics, which is already algorithmic starting with algebra, will serve most people better than computer science will.

Well what should states do as far as secondary ed?

I think we can all agree that ensuring all graduates can in fact read well, posses some number sense in the form of statistics, be able to do common algebra, and perhaps basic differential calculus, and know some things about the natural sciences.

Most states are failing pretty hard at that and our education-industrial-complex finds all manor of excuses ranging from more-inflation-adjusted-spending-per-pupil than at any point in history just isn&#39;t enough, to

As a child you have no idea what you want to do with your life. The goal of high school should be both to educate in critical areas (reading, math, social studies, financial literacy, health, etc) but also to expose students to the broadest amount of trades possible. I think students should spend time writing code as much as they should spend time disecting an animal, mixing a chemical, or welding. Only through doing can we learn what our passion is.

If a student never experiences something how can they decide to do it as a career?

Education should be more generic at the primary level, but needs to become more specific at the secondary level or beyond.  If one wants to go into literature, there is no reason to torture one w/ learning complex math, trigonometry or calculus.  If one wants to go on to make computers, there is no reason one should be forced to read Milton or Tolstoy or Dumas.  If one wants to go into medicine, there is no reason to make one study world history and current affairs.  And so on

West Virginia needs to stop doing whatever the hypest corporation tells it to do.Corporation? Our own government the last 5 years or so took the position that every kid should learn to code, because there was no future in things like, oh, honest manual work. AI has fucked the assumptions of everyone from the halls of Congress all the way to Silicon Valley.

Not everybody needs to know how to program, and those people who were being forced into taking a CS class were likely never going to be all that good at it.

If anything, they were likely creating the next generation of managers who think that they understand IT because they took one college course in it. They know just enough to have dangerous assumptions, but not enough knowledge to be genuinely useful.

They are probably correct.  The reality is that trying to make &quot;coding&quot; a forced part of graduation for 100% of students, to me, seems very extreme.  Especially when the majority of them will actually never code afterwards.  And also especially in an AI era where a lot of

I would argue that this is a better choice.  People need to know basics of things, like backups, personal security, 2FA, dealing with the ever growing onslaught of scams, phishing attempts, and many other things.  A CS course provides far less value than a  basic user education course.

Let CS be a thing, but first teach safeguards and how not to get obliterated by a criminal org first.

Imagine if a company demanded you install a camera in your bedroom, that you couldn&#39;t turn off, cover, or obscure.  You have no access to the feed from the camera, when it&#39;s on, or what it captures.  You have no control over what happens to the video, who it&#39;s shared with, and how it&#39;s analyzed.  Furthermore, you have to take on pure faith the good intentions of the company.   Do you trust them, would you go ahead with accepting that policy?   Of course not, but many privacy policies are effectively no better, and now imagine it&#39;s not your bedroom, it&#39;s your child&#39;s, and it becomes clear why you need to carefully review privacy policies.    For anyone who thinks your government will protect you, if the company baselessly claims they won&#39;t hand out the video, or misuse the contents, that generally satisfies the majority of federal security policy. If you read that, and still find privacy policy boring, you&#39;re not paying attention. The amount of kick back I get to that kind of explanation is actually ridiculous, being in that course, I break down the Monday.com privacy policy, and show how it&#39;s so invasive, and violating that Epstein would get a hard on.

This is pretty advanced.  What ought to happen is teach kids different things in different stages

How are they going to understand a programming language?

&quot;ChatGPT can you &#39;asplain this here code thingy?&quot;

The downfall of what will probably not much longer be a global power. Sad to watch.

If so, then I think this will be a really good thing.

No...abstract algebra and complex analysis for all!

After all, the need to prove the computational bounds on finding the complex roots of an arbitrary polynomial is all around us!

Everyone needs to know arithmetic and almost everyone is capable of it. Some people need geometry and trig and many people are capable of that. But not very many people need to or are even remotely capable of winning the Fields Medal. And that&#39;s okay.

A similar spectrum of need and aptitude exists for C

It was good to start the day with a laugh.

I wonder if they&#39;ll also add in Fist Recognition, as I suspect their glasses may be experiencing those in the near future...?

Is there a word that combines laughable and infuriating?

Because this is both. They fact that MetaZuck has the gall to say openly that they can be trusted to find a &quot;balance&quot; around privacy when their business model is surveillance makes me want to scream. And then when I&#39;m done screaming, to laugh.

The only glimmer of hope is that the downsides of this will probably show up so quickly and they will respond with the usual mealy mouth platitude and lies, that it may finally force some sort of real oversight of

&quot;Privacy Rapist Meta[stasize] Plans To Let Smart Glasses Identify People Through AI-Powered Facial Recognition&quot;

Oh, from day one. They even say so in the summary. The limit on only showing people connected to you on Facebook only applies to what you see, not what is recorded in their database.

Meta plans to add facial recognition technology to its Ray-Ban smart glasses as soon as this year..For exactly what benefit?  Yes Meta.  Get specific for me while I walk through your executive hallways wearing your finest feature to face-ID and auto-search the Epstein files.Kills me it was barely over a decade ago that wearers of smart glasses were known as &quot;glassholes&quot; in public.  For privacy reasons.  And Google&#39;s version at the time didn&#39;t have anywhere NEAR this privacy-raping capability.A new privay-destroying concept reaching the median-intelligence level to garner an &quot;are you insane?&quot; response from the average seasoned citizen, used to take more than a generation.  Today, it barely takes a decade for a horrible idea to come &#39;round again pretending to be better, because people are that stupid and shortsighted.

Would this not require that you have privacy settings in Facebook set in such a way that allows you to be tagged in uploaded photos?

I have a long-dormant FB account, but the privacy settings have always (since the setting was introduced) been set to not allow people to tag me.

I have a long-dormant FB account, but the privacy settings have always (since the setting was introduced) been set to not allow people to tag me.I do not have a FB account and have never had one. How do I say that I do not want to be tagged ? The only way would be for the default to be no, but FB will no do that.

And would that be &#39;wrong&#39; if they did? If someone starts using a cane, because they realize they don&#39;t have the reflex and balance they once did something anyone objects to?

That is the trouble here as is often the case. This could be a really useful tool. Just having immediate basic intelligence in a lot of settings would be valuable.

Some people just are poor at remembering a face or putting it together with a name...and some get that way as they age.  Could someone who realizes that they
are starting to lose it wear the glasses so their problems would not be noticed so easily?Great! I like that. I&#39;d proposed THOSE people should get a prescription for the advantage of this augmentation to help them live a more normal life.
Kind of like ppl get a handicap parking sticker, or some people get prescription narcotics to help them live a functionally &quot;normal&quot; life.

Letting anyone have this is chaos.

But then, I suppose, because of the world we live in, ppl would abuse the system and claim they have a problem to gain access to this new super power for nefarious purposes....  OR, hey,

You will need to get informed consent from anybody you want to apply this to beforehand, in writing. In Germany, if it is not directly visible these are recording devices, even possession may be illegal.

This is also illegal in the state of Illinois, has been since 2008. https://www.ilga.gov/Legislati... [ilga.gov]

Wyze cameras have a friendly faces feature, you can&#39;t enable it in Illinois.

They will have to geofence this for certain areas

Good. At least some legislators in the US get it.

potentially limiting identification to people connected on Meta platforms or those with public accounts.wouldnt it require scanning and analyzing the faces in order to determine if they have accounts?

You are required to stare at a new face every 3 seconds.

Unfortunately the cat is out of the bag on this, it is basically unpreventable. Facial recognition can be applied to any video stream or recording from existing surveillance cameras, such as one that&#39;s pointed at the entrance to the supermarket where you shop. These rayban glasses are merely a mobile platform for acquiring the video. Packing the recognition tech into such a small package is a demonstration that it can be deployed almost anywhere.

“Face recognition technology on the streets of America poses a uniquely dire threat to the practical anonymity we all rely on,” said Nathan Freed Wessler of the American Civil Liberties Union. “This technology is ripe for abuse.”

And boy, it sure is. A garden variety miscreant will be able to tag and acquire the name, address, phone number, and marital status of all the pretty girls he comes across in the grocery store for future stalking purposes. Potentially vulnerable elderly people can be similarly identified. Wire this into the Flock license plate reader network and the government will have full coverage of your movements, indoors and out.

I am torn on this. I look forward to being able to greet each of my customers by name. I am horrible with names. There is only 5 of us that work here but there are thousands of customers so they remember us, but we struggle to remember their names. I have even looked into adding it into our security system so could see as they walk up. All that being said, that is the only valid excuse I can think of for using this and I can think of plenty of reasons against it.

I am torn on this. I look forward to being able to greet each of my customers by name. I am horrible with names. There is only 5 of us that work here but there are thousands of customers so they remember us, but we struggle to remember their names. I have even looked into adding it into our security system so could see as they walk up. All that being said, that is the only valid excuse I can think of for using this and I can think of plenty of reasons against it.

Is Justice Samuel Alito getting ready to call it quits? A flurry of recent hints has prompted new speculation that the Supreme Court’s most reliably partisan conservative is eyeing the exits in advance of the 2026 midterms. On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern sift through the clues, politics, and legacy management that may be driving Alito toward retirement. They also game out whom President Donald Trump might pick—among the many MAGA judges already campaigning for the seat—as the justice’s possible successor. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Our friend Elie Mystal wrote a great piece in the Nation saying he thinks Alito is going to step down. Our friends at Strict Scrutiny have also suggested as much. Mark, what’s your gossipy buzz telling you?

Mark Joseph Stern: I agree. And the first reason is the announcement of the justice’s forthcoming memoir, which is pompously titled So Ordered: An Originalist’s View of the Constitution, the Court, and Our Country. Of course, justices do publish books on the bench. But there are some indications that this particular release will be a farewell postscript for Alito’s service. First, it’s coming out on Oct. 6, which is one day after the Supreme Court’s next term begins. As Elie noted, it is unusual for the justices to publish books in October because they like to promote their books, and they can’t do that when they’re stuck in D.C., hearing oral arguments. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett all published recent books in early September—timing that makes sense because that’s when the public is starting to pay attention again. The new term is gearing up, but the justices are not stuck in Washington. They are still free to fly around the country, plugging their latest release. I think it’s pretty unlikely that Alito would drop his memoir on a date when he specifically cannot do that.

Second, Alito just celebrated the 20th anniversary of his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Conservative lawyers and pundits marked the occasion by publishing laudatory articles that had, to me, a distinctly valedictory feel to them. That includes at least one former clerk who may well be in contact with the justice and even have an inkling of his plans. On top of that, Alito gave this rare interview to Politico, which surprised me given that it was Politico that published the leak of his Dobbs draft opinion. So you’d think he might have a grudge. Anyway, in that interview, he seemed to look back over his service and view Dobbs as his finest achievement, almost like the capstone of his tenure. He also hinted that he was not really enjoying the job or the coarse civic culture of our current moment.

Finally, there’s another book coming out, this one by Mollie Hemingway, a MAGA pseudo-journalist, called Alito: The Justice Who Reshaped the Supreme Court and Restored the Constitution. It’s going to be this obsequious, bootlicking celebration of Alito’s brilliance. The publisher’s description calls it “the authoritative—and explosive—inside story of Justice Samuel Alito and his powerful role in shaping the Supreme Court.” It seems highly probable that Alito gave interviews to Hemingway, even if it was on background. It feels to me as if he is trying to secure his legacy within the conservative legal movement and the conservative media, which is what matters most to him. And I think that the main reason he would be doing that is because he’s ready to step down and pass the torch.

I was struck by the fact that in the Politico interview, Alito said he wished Justice Antonin Scalia were around to take a victory lap, because the court has achieved so much of what he worked toward and is now finally on the right track. It’s so sad he’s missing it. Within a paragraph, Alito then suggested that Scalia would have been “appalled” by the ugliness, the coarseness of the discourse. Well, who was single-handedly responsible for coarsening the discourse at the Supreme Court for a very long time? Why, it was Scalia! He’d be loving the discourse right now. He built it.

I also think this love story about originalism from Alito feels a little cynical. You and I have spent a lot of time discussing whether Alito really is an originalist or if whether is perfectly result-oriented and completely political. Either way, I guess the better question isn’t what Alito calls himself but what he does. If he does step down soon, won’t it probably be because he wants Trump to replace him while Republicans hold the Senate?

Alito is not an originalist. In fact, he’s made fun of originalism before. His jurisprudence is completely aligned with the Republican Party platform. He watches Fox News. I’m sure he reads the polls. He must know there is a real chance that Republicans could lose the Senate in the fall—which, of course, means that he would be stuck on the bench for at least two more years, maybe six more years, maybe even longer.

And we know that his wife, Martha-Ann, has been counting the minutes until Alito can retire so she can fly whatever flag she wants to.

Martha-Ann definitely wants him to step down. And Alito saw how Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a bad bet and wound up getting replaced by a successor who is torching her legacy. He doesn’t want that to happen. He is savvy enough to know that stepping down before the midterms means that Trump can replace him with someone who is just as conservative, if not more so. Republicans have a comfortable margin in the Senate. Retiring now could cement his jurisprudence for years to come with a mini-Alito who is 30 years younger. That’s probably what is guiding his decision more so than anything else. But in fairness, when we give justices life tenure, we empower them to make these kinds of partisan decisions. You can hate the game, but you can’t really hate the player.

Who do you think could potentially inherit the mantle of the man who gave us witchburners as the reason to overturn Roe v. Wade?

I will throw out two names: Emil Bove, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, and Andy Oldham, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. I flag Bove because he has already proved his absolute fealty to Trump—first as his personal lawyer, then at the Justice Department, when he struck the corrupt bargain to drop criminal charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, defied court orders barring the illegal deportation of Venezuelan migrants, and reportedly helped kill the investigation into Tom Homan’s alleged acceptance of a bribe. We know that Trump was disappointed in his first three picks because he felt as if they weren’t sufficiently loyal to him. With Bove, he wouldn’t have to worry about that.

At the same time, I can imagine that the White House might not want to reopen Bove’s scandals or give Democrats an opportunity to probe them. He’s already gotten his reward with a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit. So, to my mind, Oldham is the more likely candidate. He’s a former Alito clerk and a MAGA fanatic who has gone very far out of his way to campaign for this seat with a constant stream of Trump-pandering opinions. He’s even further right than Alito, who has overruled him multiple times. He also looks the part, which may seem like a shallow observation, but we know that that is important to this president. I think he has a leg up on his colleague James Ho, who has also been campaigning for the seat, because Ho will not look the part to this president. If I had to put money down, I’d say Oldham will be the pick, because he’s got the far-right jurisprudence and he looks like the MAGA justice from central casting in Donald Trump’s dreams.

I think you’re aiming way too high in selecting actual sitting judges for this. I’m going to go with Lindsey Halligan and Jeanine Pirro. I know central casting is the most important phrase for Trump when selecting someone. But I also think the “Own the Libs” vibe is such that it could be Kash Patel. You seemed to suggest that gravitas at some level is important. And I’m not sure it’s going to be.

There was a moment, when the tech CEOs and media moguls were lining up to kiss Trump’s ring, when it looked like almost all the demographic arrows were pointing right, where it looked like Trumpism was, if not widely embraced, at least too big to be written off. After a year of Trump back in office, the culture cries out for Woke 2.0.

It has been a year since J.D. Vance went to Europe and chose (rhetorical) violence.

At the Munich Security Conference last February, the vice president described Europe’s greatest threat as one “from within,” chiding its leadership for suppressing national speech and political participation, especially of anti-immigrant, anti-EU movements. Vance’s hostility, combined with some hypocrisy, shocked leaders: They’d expected a lecture from the incoming administration, but maybe on defense spending. Instead, Vance’s position suggested a more profound rupture in the trans-Atlantic relationship, one where the U.S.’s commercial tech interests and ideological affinity for Europe’s far right were coalescing into a broader attack on European sovereignty.

In the year since, the rift has widened, as the Trump administration and its allies have found common cause with Europe’s far right. In early February, the House GOP Judiciary Committee accused Europe of a “decade-long” campaign to censor the global internet, including by using its regulatory power to “silence political opposition.” European far-right leaders and political parties seized on these claims. “So maybe without interference of the EU we could have won the elections in 2025,” Geert Wilders, the leader of Party of Freedom, a Dutch far-right party, wrote on X.

It’s part of a broader effort between the MAGA movement, including Donald Trump and his allies, and the European populist right to frame the European Union as stifling free speech, particularly on U.S. tech platforms. Prominent voices in American Big Tech, most notably Elon Musk, have long opposed Europe’s attempts at moderating these platforms, and that has converged with the Trump administration’s deepening antagonism toward the European Union.

Now, American and European leaders are back in Munich starting Friday, with even more baggage between them: defense, Ukraine, tariffs, Trump’s designs on Greenland. All, or just one, could be fatal for a nearly 80-year partnership. But the U.S.’s push against what it perceives as censorship points to a more foundational break, one where the U.S. is more openly hostile to the European project and is actively seeking to destabilize European governance.

“In the past, people talked about how the liberal democratic shared value base was a glue for the trans-Atlantic relationship, even at times when perhaps strategic interests were diverging,” said Leonard A. Schütte, an international security program fellow at the Harvard Belfer Center. “Now we have divergent strategic interests and a diverging ideological value base. I’m extremely worried about the future of the trans-Atlantic relationship given those two fundamental forces.”

There are two components to these diverging ideological values. The first is a U.S. and European divide on how to manage tech and social platforms, including content moderation, data transparency, and privacy rules. This kind of policy split is not unusual, and past U.S. administrations—including Obama and Trump I—sometimes pushed back against Europe’s efforts to rein in American tech companies. But this Trump administration has framed such regulations as illiberal suppression of political speech and populist opposition movements. That has turned a divergence on how the European Union does tech policy into a more sweeping indictment of how Europe does democracy.

The particular boogeyman of the moment is the Digital Services Act, which fully went into effect in 2024, and broadly regulates large internet platforms—like Musk’s X or Meta’s Facebook—by asking those giants to remove content that would be illegal under EU or national laws, while also putting in procedures for users to challenge decisions. It pushes for greater accountability on things like advertising practices. Musk has declared all-out war on the DSA, in part because X came under the law’s scrutiny pretty quickly. In December, X was fined 120 million euros for violations after an investigation around the lack of transparency around who now had blue check-mark accounts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the fine on Musk’s X “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.”

Andrew Peek, the director of the Adrienne Arsht National Security Resilience Initiative of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center, and former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council under Trump, said that many in the administration and close to it are scarred from the COVID-19 pandemic and the politics around it, which they saw as a time of government overreach that shut down dissenting views on social media. “This really resonates very deeply, this systemic concern with political freedom and how easily it’s snuffed out,” Peek said. “I don’t want to sound hyperbolic—because it does sound hyperbolic—but I think this is legitimate. This is the way people feel.”

For a U.S. looking at Europe, Peek added, “it is perceived by us as an external interference in national elections and national politics, usually to the detriment of what the Trump administration would see as ideologically simpatico groups.”

Across Europe, freedom-of-speech laws are less absolutist than in the U.S., including a stricter approach to hate speech, born out of its history from World War II. But MAGA and those simpatico groups in Europe claim that is making them a target for their legitimate views, particularly on migration. “The European right-wing parties have tried to frame this, and the U.S. fight against increased platform regulation in Europe, as a fight against their positions—as a fight against their political combat to gain power,” said Jacob Ross, research fellow at the European Center at the German Council on Foreign Relations.

Ross said the MAGA movements, including parts of the administration, and certain European right-wing movements (like Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland) or those in power (like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán) see themselves aligned in wanting to change the trans-Atlantic and the Western status quo. “That’s an ideological common ground that exists and that certain elements of the U.S. government try to exploit,” he said, though he added it can get a bit awkward when the U.S. does things—like threaten to invade Greenland—that put these nationalistic parties in a tough spot. “That forced many European right-wing populists to distance themselves, to underline that they have their country’s interests in mind, European interests in mind,” Ross said, “while at the same time still hoping for some kind of support, certainly through the networks, and maybe money-wise as well, from these U.S. forces.”

Riccardo Alcaro, research coordinator and head of the global actors program at the Istituto Affari Internazionali, said that wing of MAGA—most closely associated with Vance and tech bros, like Musk, and Vance ally Peter Thiel—see Europe as an “object of almost resentful nostalgia,” because they believe it is betraying its cultural, religious (meaning Christian), and ethnic roots. Or as the White House’s National Security Strategy put it: “We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation.”

Linking regulation and civilization makes this existential for MAGA and its right-wing allies in Europe. That will likely make it harder for the U.S. to work constructively with Europe on legitimate concerns about, say, the regulatory burdens or even on censorship of political speech. Critics, for example, have raised concerns about its approach to disinformation during emergencies. But the United States is deploying a blunt, all-or-nothing approach. It sanctioned a former EU official that the State Department called the “mastermind” behind the DSA. The Financial Times reported that the State Department will fund MAGA-aligned think tanks, including to help undermine the DSA. Bram Vranken, a researcher and campaigner at the Corporate Europe Observatory, noted that Big Tech, including Meta and Google, have increased their lobbying of far-right groups in the European parliament. “They’re building a bridge between the Trump administration and the European far right,” he added.

This leaves the European Union and many of its leaders in another impossible bind, not unlike the one it’s facing on its defense amid the Trump administration’s flagging commitment to NATO and the president’s desire to coerce an ally to hand over its territory. When it comes to tech, as with defense, Europe is deeply, deeply reliant on American services. The European Digital SME Alliance, a trade group, said almost 80 percent of Europe’s digital tech is imported. What is more, America’s increasing hostility is raising concerns that if the U.S. took aggressive action—over Greenland, say—it could potentially wield that tech dependency as leverage, cutting off access and crippling European critical infrastructure.

“What [the Trump] administration has done is that they have really created a kind of Sputnik moment, where the Europeans realize now that this decoupling, or de-risking, from American technology is inevitable,” said Anu Bradford, a leading scholar on EU regulation at Columbia Law School.

But this realization comes with another: Right now, Europe has few alternatives. France announced that a French videoconferencing platform will replace American services for its government departments, but with the target date of 2027, according to ABC News. Aura Salla, member of the European Parliament from Finland in the European People’s Party, said there is a growing acceptance that Europe needs technological sovereignty. But, she added, “it will take time.”

Europe has been a very, very good market for American tech, which underscores the risk of the Trump administration’s blunt use of leverage with its European partners. Yet Europe isn’t a market Big Tech will quietly walk away from, either. Evelyn Austin, the executive director of Bits of Freedom, an Amsterdam-based digital rights organization, put it this way: “Reliance brings problems—and getting out of that reliance brings risks.”

Austin said she thinks Europe should identify this reliance as a national security threat, which might empower countries to accelerate that decoupling.

“What I find really daunting is the consequences or implications of that,” Austin said. “You’re walking into a very, very conflictual relationship with the U.S.—and that terrifies me. But I’m not sure if there’s any way around it. Aren’t we actually already there?”

There are many things for Europeans to worry about as they watch the Trump administration blow up the international order. There is the chaos of having international markets careening around the whims of one man. There is the ominous talk from an aggressive superpower lusting over Greenland. There is the catastrophic dismantling of efforts to rally the world to address the climate crisis.

But for certain European countries, Donald Trump poses a threat that taps into a more intimate and sickeningly primal fear: that Americans will force-feed them our disgusting chicken. Specifically, our “chlorine chicken,” Europe’s term for American chemically washed poultry.

“EXCLUSIVE: UK-US Trade Deal: Keep Your Chlorine Chicken America, Britain Must Not Pay This Price,” read one British headline from May. “Don’t Like the Idea of Chlorinated Chicken? You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet,” read another.

The panic over “chlorine chicken” is a noble British tradition that reappears every time the public considers the prospect of deepening its economic entanglement with the U.S. This particular European bogeyman dates back to 2014, when the U.S. and the European Union were negotiating a trans-Atlantic trade agreement. All the European countries shared the U.S. poultry aversion at the time: Germany calls it, we’re happy to report, chlorhühnchen. But the U.K. has more justification for its fears these days, as Brexit left its regulations more open to adjustment.

Now, the nation is in the grip of its latest chicken panic: British media have reported that the Trump administration is once again pressuring the U.K. to concede some of its food standards. In December, the Telegraph reported an alarming story with the headline “White House Demands British Supermarkets Stock Chlorinated Chicken.” According to the report, it all came down to a $40 billion technology agreement the White House had scrapped with the U.K. That failed deal was part of a cluster of agreements between the two nations meant to supplement the larger deal from May, which had excluded some economic sectors. The tech deal would have set terms for the nations’ collaboration over artificial intelligence and quantum computing. But in December, the White House quashed the deal, citing displeasure with the U.K.’s online safety rules, its digital services tax—and, strangely, food safety rules.

As the Telegraph described the negotiations, the U.S. trade envoy had been quite pointed about the food safety matter, particularly as it related to poultry and beef. Even though the deal had nothing to do with food, if the country wanted to revive it—something that promised significant investment from the U.S.—it would need to get over its squeamishness.

The British people don’t care for this. According to the British agricultural press, more than 150,000 Brits have since signed petitions urging their supermarket chains to “publicly rule out chlorinated chicken.” The angst lingers into the new year. It appears that the British public is realizing that fending the chlorine chicken off once doesn’t mean it won’t pop right back up as a matter of debate: As Trump has continued to toy with the global financial order, American unpredictability has changed the nature of this particularly British anxiety. No longer does the poultry panic emerge just for agricultural trade deals; Trump has made “chlorinated chicken” a permanent low-level threat, a dark, feathered cloud hovering over the British Isles. Thanks to Trump’s reputation for capriciousness, the great poultry panic may just be here to stay.

To be clear, “chlorine” is not a fully accurate word to describe American chicken; per the National Chicken Council, less than 5 percent of American chicken is treated with chlorine. Nowadays, the industry uses more effective cleaners, such as peracetic acid, a kind of all-purpose antimicrobial agent used in hospital cleaners, produce washes, and meat processing.

The data remain unclear as to whether the American method is actually that much worse, but the problem is more one of the general imagination: In the British mind, their chickens (and all other livestock) are dutifully cared for in sanitary, healthy conditions from birth to slaughter, keeping them disease-free from the start. Our chickens, on the other hand, are treated abominably, packed in tightly with their germy brethren, raised in squalor, pumped with hormones, and only made clean at the end. It’s a matter of washing off the filth—with unnatural chemicals, at that—versus never picking up the filth in the first place. This picture gives the Brits the heebie-jeebies. It’s not a fully accurate picture, as the British do still have factory farms, but it’s true that their standards for animal welfare are higher and that they don’t use nearly as many antibiotics. And it’s also true that their food safety philosophy about keeping away contamination at all stages is entirely different from the American fix-it-later mentality.

It was this cultural gag reflex that caused the specter of American chicken to become a major point of contention during Brexit, when people became worried the renegotiated trade deals would make their own food-safety attitudes vulnerable to assault from our population’s street-rat standards. Indeed, the U.S. tried: In 2019, BuzzFeed News reported that the first Trump administration was offering to pay up to $92,000 to have British journalists brought in on a tour of U.S. farms, with the goal of addressing “misconceptions” about chlorinated chicken.

The Brits warded off the American chicken then, but only after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the leader of the Labour Party a “gigantic chlorinated chicken.” Then, as now, everyone across all ideological lines feared the chicken; accusing political opponents of being soft on chlorine chicken is a legitimate attack. When Nigel Farage, a Trump ally, argued that the U.K. should allow chlorinated chicken (the British already ate questionable chicken from Thailand, he argued), it was a minor scandal. In 2023, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak solemnly vowed there would “be no chlorine-washed chicken and no hormone-treated beef on the U.K. market. Not now, not ever.”

But the Americans have fought for the chicken. Most recently, when the U.S. and U.K. negotiated a new trade deal last spring, the Trump White House did, indeed, try to bully the country into adjusting its food standards. The White House called them “non-science-based standards that severely restrict U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry products.” (Headlines: “Trump Tells UK to Buy Their Chlorinated Chicken if They Want Tariff Relief.”) White House adviser Peter Navarro tried to assert that the Brits were missing out on a “very fine American agricultural product,” and “we don’t believe that once they taste American beef and chicken that they would prefer not to have it.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to reassure the public that the government wouldn’t budge on this, and thanks to pressure from constituents, it didn’t.

But this bowel-clenching British fear didn’t simply disappear. Trump has continued to harangue the country about food standards, even after the Brits thought they’d struck a chlorine-free deal less than a year ago. And that’s the bigger problem: Alliances depend on trust, and the U.S. can no longer be trusted to keep its word—even when it comes to not forcing our icky chicken on Europeans.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ignore patches at your own risk. According to Uncle Sam, a SQL injection flaw in Microsoft Configuration Manager patched in October 2024 is now being actively exploited, exposing unpatched businesses and government agencies to attack.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added CVE-2024-43468 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog on Thursday, setting a March 5 deadline for federal agencies to deploy the patch.

The 9.8-rated SQL injection vulnerability exists in Microsoft Configuration Manager, which IT admins use to manage organizations&#39; Windows-based servers and laptops. And it allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database. It&#39;s a very serious flaw that needs to be fixed ASAP - or 16 months ago.

Mehdi Elyassa, a red teamer at French cybersecurity firm Synacktiv, found and reported the bug to Microsoft. The Register reached out to Microsoft for comment, but did not immediately receive responses to our questions, so we don&#39;t know who is battering this bug or how many customers are affected. We will update this story when we hear back.

CISA says it&#39;s &quot;unknown&quot; if this CVE has been abused in ransomware attacks.

When it originally disclosed the bug in October 2024, Microsoft deemed it &quot;exploitation less likely,&quot; and the Windows vendor&#39;s security update still lists that vulnerability as not being under attack. Since that time, however, at least two proof-of-concept exploits have been published, so you really should drop everything else and patch this bug before taking off for the long Presidents&#39; Day weekend.

We&#39;re sincerely hoping that all Microsoft admins, or at least those in the US, enjoy the Monday holiday after what has been a very busy second week of February.

On Tuesday, Redmond gifted them with 59 new CVEs, six of which had already been exploited before Microsoft issued a patch.

Per usual, Microsoft did not provide additional details about who attacked these six flaws and how widespread exploitation may be.

Three of the six, however, are also listed as publicly disclosed - meaning there may already be proof-of-concept exploits available. So it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll hear about these CVEs under attack soon, and not a year and a half from now. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has outlined the first 26 goals for its project to inject AI into the government&#39;s scientific research, and everything from securing critical minerals to discovering a unified theory of physics is on the table.

The Department of Energy, which is leading Trump&#39;s Genesis Mission to spur a nationwide effort to incorporate AI into the scientific process at a Manhattan Project-like scale, announced the list of &quot;26 science and technology challenges of national importance&quot; on Thursday. Each was selected, the DoE said, for its potential to deliver actual benefits to America and speed up the Genesis Mission&#39;s general pace of advancement.

&quot;These challenges represent a bold step toward a future where science moves at the speed of imagination because of AI,&quot; said DoE under secretary for science and Genesis Mission lead Darío Gil. &quot;It&#39;s a game-changer for science, energy, and national security.&quot;

Of course, given it&#39;s a federal government project with lofty scientific ambitions that require reliable AI to achieve, there wasn&#39;t a timeline given outside of the DoE saying it wants its AI efforts to &quot;double the productivity and impact of US research and development within a decade.&quot;

The 26-page document listing the various objectives is relatively brief, only describing the challenge, explaining how the DoE wants AI to solve it, justifying its inclusion in the list, and describing its potential national impact.

The goal of &quot;accelerating delivery of nuclear fusion,&quot; for example, says that today&#39;s device-specific trials, isolated from other areas of dependency (e.g., connecting it to the grid, commercialization, etc.), aren&#39;t enough to take fusion out of its perpetual status as always being 30 years away.

Digital twins, says the DoE, would allow physicists to experiment with fusion reactors and their various integrations more consistently, so the Genesis Mission will work on an &quot;AI-Fusion Digital Convergence Platform&quot; to do just that.

The platform envisioned by the Genesis team &quot;will integrate novel algorithms in HPC codes, foundation models for plasma and materials science, physics- and chemistry-informed neural networks, surrogate models, and digital twins for whole-facility modeling and real-time control,&quot; according to the DoE. Simple as that, then.

Many of the projects in the document are similarly vague and open-ended, like &quot;reenvisioning advanced manufacturing and industrial productivity,&quot; &quot;securing US leadership in data centers,&quot; and &quot;achieving AI-driven autonomous laboratories.&quot;

Other goals are a bit more grounded, such as digitizing and structuring more than eight decades of US nuclear data into secure, searchable datasets to inform future energy and security decisions, and applying AI to better predict water needs tied to the country’s expanding energy system. Still, many of the remaining challenges read more like high-level research prompts than deliverables, ambitious whether AI is involved or not.

According to White House office of science and technology policy director Michael Kratsios, the challenge list isn&#39;t stopping at those 26 items. No timeline was given as to when more can be expected.

The Genesis Mission also comes as the Trump administration has slashed scientific funding, eliminated experts, and reduced research budgets across federal government branches, including at the Department of Energy.

The Trump administration’s FY2026 budget request asked Congress to cut DoE’s Office of Science from $8.24 billion in FY2025 to $7.092 billion, and to slash the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) account from $3.46 billion to $888 million. In the case of the Office of Science, Congress declined to adopt the proposed cut, with the FY2026 Energy and Water bill listing roughly $8.4 billion for the office, though other parts of DoE’s energy R&D portfolio still face reductions compared to prior levels.

Regardless of those reprieves, scientific professionals told The Register early in Trump&#39;s second term that they were concerned that the future of US scientific leadership was at stake due to layoffs and cuts. As has been shown in the commercial world, it&#39;s entirely possible AI science will leave the government begging for human researchers to take their jobs back. ®

            <h2>AMD climbs in desktop and server CPUs while Intel battles supply squeeze</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/amd_intel_market_share/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel continues to lose market share to rival AMD across server, desktop, and mobile processors, and this has been noticeable in PCs thanks to supply constraints on Chipzilla&#39;s processors.

The latest figures from PC component watcher Mercury Research, covering Q4 of 2025, indicate that AMD now accounts for about 36 percent of the CPUs going into desktop PC systems, quite a jump from just under 27 percent for the same time last year.

With mobile chips for laptops, the gain isn&#39;t quite so noticeable, with 26 percent coming from AMD in Q4, up from 23.8 percent for the same period a year ago. The flip side of that is that Intel is still filling 74 percent of mobile PCs.

This is despite Intel suffering supply constraints on client processors due to a decision the company made earlier in the year to reallocate manufacturing capacity to output more server chips. This hurt its ability to build and sell processors for PCs.

As a consequence, total x86 processor unit shipments declined during the last quarter of 2025, which was unusual as the fourth quarter would normally see the highest sequential growth in unit shipments for the year, Mercury says.

But it wasn&#39;t all going AMD&#39;s way as shipments of the firm&#39;s gaming SoCs declined as expected. This is because we are said to be nearing the end of the current console cycle, so demand drops off in anticipation of new models.

Server CPU shipments were up strongly during Q4, according to Mercury, with Intel&#39;s deliveries growing at nearly double the seasonal average, but AMD saw growth at more than triple the seasonal average.

For AMD, its 5th Gen Epyc chips accounted for more than 50 percent of server revenues for the first time during the quarter, and Intel&#39;s Emerald Rapids 5th Gen family is also believed to have taken the lead from the Sapphire Rapids 4th Gen portfolio to become Intel&#39;s best-selling server parts.

When it comes to share, Intel still takes the lion&#39;s portion at just over 71 percent of the server processor market. But AMD can take solace as its figure of 28.8 percent means it is closing in on a third market share, an increase of 3.1 percentage points from the 25.7 percent it stood at a year ago.

So it doesn&#39;t look too bad for Intel, all things considered, which is odd as the company went to the trouble of sending us comments relating to these latest Mercury Research figures.

For the record, Chipzilla wants you to know that it is &quot;leaning hard into a simplified, accelerated roadmap – backed by strong server demand and major client portfolio updates – to stabilize and strengthen share as we move further into 2026.&quot;

Mercury says that there is a larger than usual uncertainty in its estimates covering Arm-based CPU shipments into the PC market for this quarter. It believes that these systems have declined to 13.3 percent in Q4 2025 from 13.7 percent in the preceding quarter. However, the total share, including Arm servers against all x86 shipments, is estimated to stand at 12 percent, up from 11.7 percent earlier in the year. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prices for memory used in routers and set-top boxes are surging nearly sevenfold thanks to AI, raising fresh fears that the industry&#39;s silicon binge could leave telcos scrambling to get customers online.

Fresh analysis from Counterpoint Research suggests the cost of memory used in consumer hardware has shot up more than 600 percent over the past year as chipmakers quietly steer production towards higher-margin AI infrastructure. The knock-on effect is being felt most sharply in broadband kit, where DRAM and NAND prices are climbing far faster than in smartphones or PCs.

&quot;Over the last nine months, smartphone memory prices jumped 3x, but the prices for &#39;consumer memory&#39;-based broadband products jumped almost 7x,&quot; Counterpoint said. &quot;Routers are hit the hardest, especially for OEMs with an unsecured supply and weaker negotiating power.&quot;

That leaves some of the telecoms industry&#39;s least glamorous hardware suddenly front and center in supply chain planning. Routers and TV boxes, once the sort of commodity gear telcos handed out like branded pens, are getting noticeably more expensive to build. In some low to mid-range models, memory alone now accounts for more than a fifth of total manufacturing costs, up from about 3 percent just a year ago.

None of this is happening in isolation. Memory shortages are already rippling through the PC market, with vendors warning of price increases and softer shipment volumes as suppliers prioritize chips for AI servers over everyday hardware.

Some of this squeeze is self-inflicted, according to Counterpoint. Telcos have spent the past couple of years adding AI-style smarts to home gateways, which means newer devices need noticeably more memory. Unfortunately, that pushes them into the same component market as hyperscale datacenters – and they don&#39;t tend to win those bidding wars.

Counterpoint reckons the consequences could stretch beyond hardware margins. Broadband rollout plans could face delays or higher procurement costs, with tight memory supply expected to persist through at least mid-2026, even if prices stop climbing as aggressively.

For customers, the fallout may creep in gradually in the form of pricier routers or slower upgrades to newer connectivity tech. For the industry, though, the broader warning is already obvious. AI may be sold as the future of computing, but right now it is also quietly reshaping semiconductor economics – and making the unglamorous business of getting people online more expensive than anyone expected. ®

            <div id="article-text">The next blackout to plunge a G20 nation into chaos might not come courtesy of cybercriminals or bad weather, but from an AI system tripping over its own shoelaces.

Analyst firm Gartner warned this week that misconfigured artificial intelligence embedded in national infrastructure could shut down critical services in a major economy as soon as 2028, delivering the kind of disruption usually blamed on hostile governments or catastrophic natural events. The prediction centers on the rapid adoption of AI in cyber-physical systems, which Gartner defines as &quot;systems that orchestrate sensing, computation, control, networking, and analytics to interact with the physical world (including humans).&quot;

Gartner&#39;s warning isn&#39;t really about attackers taking over AI tools – it&#39;s about what happens when everything is working as intended... until it isn&#39;t. More operators are allowing machine learning systems to make real-time decisions, and those systems can respond unpredictably if a setting is changed, an update is pushed, or flawed data is entered.

Unlike traditional software bugs that might crash a server or scramble a database, errors in AI-driven control systems can spill into the physical world, triggering equipment failures, forcing shutdowns, or destabilizing entire supply chains, Gartner warns.

&quot;The next great infrastructure failure may not be caused by hackers or natural disasters but rather by a well-intentioned engineer, a flawed update script, or a misplaced decimal,&quot; cautioned Wam Voster, VP Analyst at Gartner.

Power grids are an obvious stress test. Energy firms now rely heavily on AI to monitor supply, demand, and renewable generation. If the software malfunctions or misreads data, sections of the network could go dark, and repairing damaged grid hardware is rarely a quick process. The same creeping automation is turning up in factories, transport systems, and robotics, where AI is slowly taking over decisions that used to involve a human looking mildly concerned at a dashboard.

Gartner&#39;s bigger worry is how quickly AI is being deployed where mistakes don&#39;t just crash software; they break real things. AI is turning up in systems where failures can shut down physical infrastructure, yet the models themselves aren&#39;t always fully understood, even by the teams building them. That makes it difficult to predict how they&#39;ll react when something unexpected happens or when routine updates are released.

&quot;Modern AI models are so complex they often resemble black boxes,&quot; said Voster. &quot;Even developers cannot always predict how small configuration changes will impact the emergent behavior of the model. The more opaque these systems become, the greater the risk posed by misconfiguration. Hence, it is even more important that humans can intervene when needed.&quot;

While regulators have spent years focusing on cybersecurity threats to operational technology, Gartner&#39;s forecast suggests the next wave of infrastructure risk could be self-inflicted rather than adversary-driven. ®

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear-powered datacenters in the US are moving closer as a consortium prepares to build proposed facilities for the Department of Energy (DoE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

At the end of 2025, nuclear developer Deep Atomic submitted its proposal to the DoE to build what it calls the &quot;nation&#39;s first nuclear-powered AI and HPC datacenter campus,&quot; at INL, where commercial nuclear power was pioneered.

While there are already datacenters next to atomic power stations, such as the Cumulus facility in Pennsylvania, now owned by Amazon, the Deep Atomic project aims to build a campus with its own dedicated power plant.

This follows moves by the DoE to colocate datacenters with energy generation facilities on federal land, spurred on by executive orders issued by President Donald Trump about removing barriers to AI development and the energy needed to power it.

The consortium around Deep Atomic includes another nuclear firm, Paragon Energy Solutions, datacenter engineering biz Future-tech, and AI infrastructure firm Moonlite.

Now real estate biz Clayco says that it is providing delivery planning on how the datacenter campus should be designed, engineered, and constructed, to further inform the DoE submission process.

The firm will advise the consortium on aligning design and construction approaches with the operational requirements of running high-density AI workloads.

&quot;Our team is proud to support Deep Atomic and the broader consortium by bringing real-world datacenter delivery experience and execution discipline to help present a buildable, delivery-ready proposal for this groundbreaking, first-of-kind project,&quot; commented Clayco founder and executive chairman Bob Clark.

If the project gets approval, construction is planned to proceed on a phased approach. The datacenter will be completed first, and Deep Atomic hopes operations will commence within 24 to 36 months, using existing grid, geothermal, and solar power already available at the INL site.

The AI compute infrastructure will thus be up and running while Deep Atomic puts its MK60 Small Modular Reactor (SMR) through design certification, fabrication, and commissioning.

Or, as a cynic might put it, the datacenter will still function, even if the SMR turns out to be a dud.

Deep Atomic claims that its MK60 unit will be able to provide 60 MW of behind-the-meter electrical power, but also 60 MW of cooling capacity – a feature designed specifically for AI and HPC datacenters, according to the firm.

We asked Deep Atomic when it expects both the datacenter and atomic plant to be operating, but the answer is likely to be &quot;several years from now.&quot;

&quot;In the nuclear world the game starts very early as there is still a fairly long runway before the realization of SMR or microreactor regulatory approval, availability at scale, and adoption in a broad commercial sense,&quot; Omdia principal analyst for Colocation and DC Building Alan Howard told The Register.

He added that he expected to see the end game of this happening around 2035, but &quot;I hope I&#39;m wrong and it&#39;s sooner.&quot;

Last year, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressed his belief that the country would have at least one SMR up and running by July 2026.

A stand-alone nuclear power source serving a stand-alone datacenter with no grid interconnection is &quot;a common vision and likely to come true in the future,&quot; according to Howard, but he said the power delivery market is &quot;evolving and exceedingly complex so how it actually plays out could be quite different.&quot;

&quot;At the end of the day, who knows where we will be on datacenter AI capacity demand in five years; the market is changing quarterly and is so dynamic it&#39;s impossible to get a solid view on the future.&quot; ®

User reviews on Steam may get more informative after a Steam Client Beta update released on Thursday, which adds an option for users to attach their hardware specs to game reviews. Steam users have always been able to share their specs in the text of their reviews, but the option to automatically include that data could encourage more users to add it, potentially making reviews more useful.

When a user posts a negative review or reports having performance issues, the attached hardware specs could reveal why, highlighting when performance issues might be caused by a player’s hardware rather than a problem with the game itself (such as specs that are below a game’s recommended minimum). The option appears as a checkbox beside the text window where users write their reviews, so users who prefer not to share their hardware data can simply leave the box unchecked.

Thursday’s beta update also includes an option for users to share anonymized framerate data with Valve. The update notes state that this data will be “stored without connection to your Steam account” and will be used to monitor game compatibility and to improve Steam. However, right now this option is currently focused “on devices running SteamOS,” Valve’s Linux-based operating system that runs on the Steam Deck.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/878761/mass-exodus-at-xai-grok-elon-musk-restructuring">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">Former employees say the restructuring followed tensions over safety and being “stuck in the catch-up phase.”

Former employees say the restructuring followed tensions over safety and being “stuck in the catch-up phase.”

The past few days have been a wild ride for xAI, which is racking up staff and cofounder departure announcements left and right. On Tuesday and Wednesday, cofounder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced his departure and that it was “time for [his] next chapter,” with cofounder Jimmy Ba following with a similar post later that day, writing that it was “time to recalibrate [his] gradient on the big picture.” The departures mean that xAI is now left with only half of its original 12 cofounders on staff. A number of staffers also took to X to announce they were leaving xAI, with some announcing that they were starting their own AI companies.

Elon Musk’s AI startup, by one merger / acquisition or another, is under the same umbrella as both his space company, SpaceX, and his social media platform, X. Since the SpaceX merger was announced last week, rumors have swirled about the reported $1.25 trillion valuation and the all-in-one company’s future plans, which Musk announced would involve “space-based AI” data centers and “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth.” In an internal meeting at xAI on Tuesday, Musk reportedly talked of plans to build an AI satellite factory and city on the Moon.

There’s often a natural departure point for companies post-merger, and Musk has announced that some of the departures were a reorganization that “unfortunately required parting ways with some people.” But there are also signs that people don’t like the direction Musk has taken things.

One source who spoke with The Verge about the happenings inside the company, who left earlier this year and requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation, said that many people at the company were disillusioned by xAI’s focus on NSFW Grok creations and disregard for safety. The source also felt like the company was “stuck in the catch-up phase” and not doing anything new or fundamentally different from its competitors. “Although we were iterating really fast, we were never able to get to a point like, ‘Oh, we’ve made a step function change over what OpenAI or Anthropic or other companies had released,’” he said.

The SpaceX merger meant that xAI shareholders were reportedly issued $250 billion in new shares, so employees with equity ostensibly have more runway to fund their own ideas. One former employee, Vahid Kazemi, wrote on X that “all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring. I think there’s room for more creativity. So, I’m starting something new.” Another former staffer said he left the company to “build something new, focused on accelerating science.”

Yet another former employee said he was launching an AI infrastructure company called Nuraline alongside other ex-xAI employees. He wrote, “During my time at xAI, I got to see a clear path towards hill climbing any problem that can be defined in a measurable way. At the same time, I’ve seen how raw intelligence can get lobotomized by the finest human errors … Learning shouldn’t stop at the model weights, but continue to improve every part of an AI system.”

Musk posted a recording of xAI’s 45-minute internal all-hands meeting that announced the changes, adding that xAI will be categorized into four main areas: Grok Main and Voice (the main Grok AI model), Coding, Imagine (image and video), and Macrohard (“which is intended to do full digital emulation of entire companies,” Musk said).

The source who departed earlier this year said Grok’s turn toward NSFW content was due partly to the safety team being let go, with little to no remaining safety review process for the models besides basic filters for things like CSAM. “Safety is a dead org at xAI,” he said. Looking at the restructured org chart Elon Musk shared on X, there’s no mention of a safety team. The source also said that during his time at xAI, he felt leadership had a lot of differing opinions on which product features to prioritize and that infighting sometimes stalled progress. A lot of decisions on what to ship happen via an all-company group chat on X with Musk in it, he said.

A second source, who departed xAI before the recent restructuring and requested anonymity, echoed the thoughts that Musk’s company was playing catch-up. “Trying to do what OpenAI was doing a year ago is not how you beat OpenAI,” he said. “Everything is a catch-up. There’s almost zero risky bet. If something hasn’t been done before we’re not going to do it.”

He mentioned xAI’s lack of safety focus too, an issue that was also highlighted in reporting by The Washington Post earlier this month.

“There is zero safety whatsoever in the company — not in the image [model], not in the chatbot,” the second source said. “He [Musk] actively is trying to make the model more unhinged because safety means censorship, in a sense, to him.”

The second source also said engineers at xAI immediately “push to prod[uction]” and that for a long time, there was no human review involved.

“You survive by shutting up and doing what Elon wants,” he said.

During the 2024 presidential election, @KamalaHQ was something of an alter ego for Vice President Kamala Harris — as Harris ran a buttoned-up campaign, the online accounts shared clips of her set to viral TikTok sounds, shitposted unflattering pictures of Donald Trump, and adopted a voice that was at times indistinguishable from the average 20-something posting about politics on X. It was an effective way to rack up likes, engagement, and explainers, but it did not stop Trump from winning a second term.

The same people who ran @KamalaHQ announced last week that they were reviving the accounts and rebranding as Headquarters, described in various places as a “Gen Z content hub,” a “newsroom,” and “an online media brand.” Headquarters launched on platforms including Instagram, TikTok, X, Substack, and Facebook, where so far it has largely shared clips of breaking news moments: Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show performance, for example, or of lawmakers grilling Trump administration officials about Jeffrey Epstein. (Its first handle on X, @headquarters_67, was derided by some; the account later changed its handle to @headquarters_68, and is now @HQNewsNow.) The Instagram account has already co-posted content with the locally focused Courier Newsroom, a similar left-leaning media brand that is expanding across the US.

The effort is a response to the reality that the right has spent years building up a content machine that now has a hold on the highest levels of the Trump administration, which itself is filled with podcasters, trolls, and internet agitators. By repurposing social media handles with millions of followers and an established voice, Headquarters is looking to flood the zone with unabashedly liberal, anti-Trump content. Some of the responses to Headquarters boiled down to “This is cringe.” Many questioned whether a content hub was enough of a response to the lawlessness of the second Trump administration. Others, of course, were happy to see the memes.

I spoke with Lauren Kapp and Parker Butler, managing partners at Luminary Strategies, and Arlie Shugaar, director of platforms at People for the American Way (PFA), part of the team running Headquarters, about their plan to counter the right-wing content machine.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

The Verge: This idea of repurposing a campaign social media account is definitely novel. How should voters and audiences understand the account? Is it an extension of the Democratic Party? Should they think of it as a third-party content creator/influencer account? Is it an extension of Kamala Harris as a politician?

Parker Butler: I would think of it as a news and commentary resource with an obviously progressive lens. The vice president does not have editorial control over the content. The accounts are repurposed, so they are not the vice president’s campaign accounts. They are an entirely new brand with a different purpose. Central to that is the recognition that an account like this with 8 million-plus followers across platforms can have an enormous impact across not just one election, but many elections, many causes, and I think that’s particularly important as we head into 2026.

How were you thinking about what to do with the account after the election?

Lauren Kapp: We saw this as a huge missed opportunity if we did not repurpose it. There was such a surge in [followers] after the ticket transition in July 2024. And while the Kamala HQ account is known for its memes and trends, we had an entire clipping apparatus that was embedded in the KHQ team and we’re really ramping that up. We’re going to be creating very similar styles of content that we were on the campaign, but also you’ll continue to see a lot of direct-to-camera videos of our staffers. The entire clipping apparatus is getting restarted again as well too, and just really holding this current administration accountable on a day-to-day basis.

How many people are working on the account on a given day?

LK: On a daily basis, there’s between eight to 12 of us who are supporting Arlie. The project is housed under People for the American Way, and Arlie is going to be building up a team. Then you have [Harris’] team, who is kind of serving as an advisory position through PFA, and then Luminary Strategies, who is our firm that’s providing the initial support for this project.

The goal is basically to find and create new talent and to create a talent pipeline through People for the American Way, given the fact that Democrats are very behind in digital at large. This account was something that I think a lot of young people found exciting during 2024, and by rebranding it, we’re hoping to have a lot of new folks that can be involved in this account in different capacities.

Talk about the sort of pipeline a little bit. Is it similar to the right’s Turning Point USA contributors, where there’s a central organization and then there are people who are on message or under the same umbrella of values and ideologies, who are then creating their own content for their own platforms?

PB: It’s a mix. Part of this is building up the talent pipeline from a staffer perspective, getting folks more in the left-leaning space who understand digital. There’s so much focus on policy and research and a more brainiac style of staffer types in the Democratic space, but there’s less of an emphasis on digital-first, online-first strategy. We want to show young people that this is a viable career path to do this sort of thing.

We’re also working with front-facing creators as well. The name of Headquarters speaks to what we want to be, which is sort of a nexus in the space. The right is this machine that is constantly putting out stuff in a coordinated way. The left feels often a lot more disparate and disconnected. We want to be that hub for a lot of folks. Whether you’re a creator or you run a page, you can feel like, “I’m being uplifted by Headquarters, I’m collaborating with them and they’re helping to grow my presence.”

“At large, the strategy has to be first and fast.”

There was the Wired story last year about a similar political group that was working with content creators to teach them how to shoot video or edit online content. Some people felt misled because they didn’t realize it was a coordinated thing. Do you worry about that type of reaction?

PB: There is an element of this program that involves collaborating with creators. It’s not like a paid operation. The point of this is to audience-build with creators. That’s one piece of this program, but another piece of it is really the owned social piece — building up these pages and putting out content from Headquarters itself. The emphasis is less on sort of coordinated creator messaging.

What does it take to get attention online in the current media ecosystem? What formats work? What tone have you landed on? What do you see doing well on social?

LK: At large, the strategy has to be first and fast. I don’t think a lot of left-leaning groups have the apparatus set up to be able to post online quickly. There’s a lot of layers of approvals that prevent people from being able to drive narratives, which often leaves people to be reactive versus proactive. [On the campaign] we had a very quick approval process where it took, barring objection, five minutes, and we are following that model because it worked during the campaign.

Arlie Shugaar: We have always split up our content strategy based on platform, but the one thing that we see really perform well across all platforms are clips. I think people really want to decide for themselves and see it straight from the source, so that’s huge for us.

Is there anything that you want to do differently with headquarters than how you did things with Kamala HQ?

AS: One of the main pieces of feedback and learnings from 2024 was that it was too trendy or too geared towards certain demographics. I’m really interested in expanding that reach and not just in a way of using different trends that might be on another side of the internet, but in a really intentional and thoughtful way that speaks to folks where they’re at and just make sense and make sure that they’re involved in the conversation.

Will Headquarters take policy positions? Will you endorse candidates?

LK: The big three for us right now are definitely Epstein, ICE, and the economy because that’s really what’s driving conversation right now and we’ll continue to churn out content on that.

I’m curious if you feel tied or burdened by the Harris/Walz agenda. Do you feel like people will associate Headquarters specifically with some of the stances or policy positions of the campaign?

PB: It’s not like we’re putting out a very specific policy. We’re not running for office. Again, this is an account that’s meant to educate people broadly about progressive issues. We are primarily a values-based account, so it’s less of a “Here’s our specific prescription of this particular policy on this particular issue,” but it’s more about “These are our values and this is the information that you need to be armed with to come to an educated conclusion and to get activated in this space.”

We trust folks to come to their own conclusions and come to their own opinions about things. This isn’t meant to be propagandizing. We are branding it as a newsroom because we want it to be information first and less of telling people exactly what to believe.

LK: There were so many criticisms about how we lost the election online, how we didn’t go on enough podcasts, we didn’t do this, we didn’t do that, and the vice president heard that and she’s taking a direct action to try to create something within the progressive ecosystem online. I personally see this as a huge investment in the space. By no means are we saying that this is going to fix everything, but this is a small step forward in the right direction.

[Asked in a follow-up email whether Headquarters would share content related to Palestine — an issue that haunted the Harris campaign and Joe Biden presidency — Butler said, “Our mission is to hold Trump and MAGA accountable on issues where they are out of step with Americans — no issue is off the table for us to talk about in that regard.”]

How do you plan to work around the fact that there are Democratic candidates around the country that aren’t totally aligned with the party? I’m thinking, like, congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh in Illinois. Would Headquarters feel comfortable posting videos of her? Would Headquarters post a video about abolishing ICE? I’m just so curious about where you stand, really.

PB: Yeah, I mean, again, that goes to what I was mentioning earlier about how we see Headquarters being a nexus of the broader space. We believe very strongly that in order to defeat fascism, we need to be a big tent. Obviously there’s different factions within the party and there’s plenty of discourse to go around on which sort of faction is better or what have you, but at the end of the day, we want to uplift the folks in the left-leaning space broadly. So absolutely, especially as we get closer to the general election and these primaries take place after that, I think we want to uplift everyone across the space because ultimately this is a very dire moment for our democracy, and so we want to make sure that the coalition to defeat MAGA is as big as possible.

There was a Headquarters launch campaign on X and other platforms. Elon Musk didn’t buy Twitter to destroy it; he bought it to remake something in his image according to his political leanings. There’s obviously issues, like the AI deepfakes. Substack has its own issues with Nazi newsletters and content that’s monetized. I’m curious if you believe you need to be on these platforms.

AS: I think that being on these platforms is pretty essential to reach the folks that are on there just getting their regular content and scrolling. We’re interested in going wherever is putting us in contact with folks that want to be reached. We had a Truth Social back in 2024, and I think we are definitely interested in going to these places where even if just one post can educate and reframe what’s happening in the conversation for people, we’re interested in doing that.

PB: We are reaching out to the reps to change the username, but yes, we will have an account there.

I think part of the reason why the right has so thoroughly dominated some of these spaces is that Elon Musk literally bought Twitter to do that, right? X has this effect of taking whatever issue Musk cares about at the moment and creating news out of it. How do you balance being active on a platform or stop posting there so that it doesn’t legitimize or normalize a far-right platform?

PB: Billionaires are buying hip social media platforms because they know that social media is ground zero for where these narratives originate. And so it would be foolish for Democrats or those on the left to see that and to say, “Okay, right-wing billionaires are doing this, so now we’re going to recede and move backward.” What we need to do is move forward and get in the game. We have to fight back. We need to invest ourselves in social media. So that’s a big part of the idea behind Headquarters is, we’ll go anywhere because the kind of voters that we have to win over and win back are exactly the type of people who may scroll on X or they might listen to a podcaster that most people on the left don’t listen to. And so we want to go everywhere.

PB: This sounds broad, but if we are able to shift the cultural tide against MAGA. There was so much conversation last year around young people moving to the right. They voted for Trump in larger numbers and that was in large part due to cultural shifts and what was seen as cool, what was seen as where to head. We want to reverse that and we want to show people that there’s a much better way.

AS: I think generally we will know if we’re successful by making sure that we’re building on the platforms, the huge platforms that we’ve already amassed, and making sure that we can keep growing those platforms and give people a sizable place to amplify their message and just get all the information out there.

So looking at followers and engagement on the platforms?

[After our conversation, Luminary Strategies shared some initial figures at the end of Headquarters’ first week back: It had racked up 160 million “views” across platforms, added 300,000 new followers, and its posts were shared more than half a million times, the firm said.]

            <div id="article-text">Before Trump Mobile, there was Canelo Mobile.

Before Trump Mobile, there was Canelo Mobile.

Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. Last week, we spoke to executives from the company for the first time, and this week we’re back with more details on how it began.

Trump Mobile may bear the US president’s name, but he didn’t come up with the idea, and neither did any Trump. In fact, it was the executives at MVNO Liberty Mobile that approached the Trumps with a pitch for the company, and it wasn’t their first rodeo; five years earlier, Liberty Mobile tested the same playbook with world champion boxer Canelo Álvarez.

That’s according to Don Hendrickson and Eric Thomas, the two Trump Mobile executives I spoke to last week, when they gave me a first look at what they said was a near-final version of the T1 Phone. Or, as Hendrickson repeatedly put it, when they decided to “open the kimono” to me and reveal more about the workings of the company.

Hendrickson has previously claimed to have come up with the initial idea for Trump Mobile. Talking to me last week he didn’t take full credit, but did say that the idea arose from conversations with the marketing team at Liberty Mobile — the MVNO owned by Hendrickson, Thomas, and fellow Trump Mobile executive Pat O’Brien. It was Hendrickson, however, who successfully pitched the idea to the Trump Organization.

“I got on a plane. I went down to Florida,” he told me. “I met with Eric Trump and his team and basically said, ‘Here’s what we would like to do. Here’s what we think we can do and here’s how we think we can help the American people.’”

What I didn’t realize before speaking to Hendrickson is that they’d tried this before. Only that time, it was with the boxer Canelo Álvarez. “We had a Canelo Mobile program with him and it was going out to service Mexican Americans here in the US, and we were looking at doing something along those lines,” Hendrickson said.

Canelo Mobile launched in May 2020 with familiar promises: wide-ranging cell coverage, perks like free international calling and roadside assistance (from Drive America, the same service bundled in with the Trump plan), and affordable Android phones, all bolstered by the presence of a famous name.

Canelo Mobile launched with two phones, dubbed The Legend and The Champ, and eventually added a third, The Contender. It made little effort to hide what they really were: handsets made by Hotpepper, a budget brand that has provided devices to budget MVNOs including Visible and Metro, along with the federal free phone program Lifeline. There’s not even a Canelo logo on the hardware, with Hotpepper’s distinctive chili logo in place instead. I reached out to Hotpepper for comment, but the support email on its website bounced.

Canelo Mobile did a better job of branding its accessories. It sold at least two separate pairs of over-ear headphones that bore Álvarez’s lettermark, and at various times sold different phone bundles advertising branded Bluetooth speakers, earbuds, baseball caps, keychains, and more.

The phones were really differentiated by their software, which supposedly included a selection of preinstalled Canelo apps. Those included the money-sending app Broxel, still one of the boxer’s sponsors, along with Álvarez’s I Can workout app, which was being marketed by an Instagram account as recently as last November but no longer seems to be available to download for either Android or iOS. They were joined by CaneloRx, a platform to buy discount prescription drugs, a move Trump himself is repeating.

Just like Trump Mobile, every element of Canelo Mobile’s cell service was powered by Liberty Mobile — Hendrickson tells me that Liberty is “umbilically connected” to Trump Mobile, even if that connection is slightly opaque to prospective customers. For Canelo Mobile, the connection was more explicit, with Liberty co-branding the service alongside Álvarez himself.

Anyone trying to predict Trump Mobile’s future may be curious to know how long Canelo Mobile lasted. After launching in 2020, there were no posts to either its Instagram or Facebook pages after July 2022. Its website stayed alive a few years longer, but Wayback Machine archives suggest that its images and formatting began to break by February 2025, and now the website is entirely offline, with the canelomobile.com domain up for auction. There is no mention at all of “Canelo Mobile” on the boxer’s current website. I reached out to Álvarez’s publicist for comment, but didn’t receive a reply in time for publication.

It’s hard to tell if Canelo Mobile was a success — its social media profiles each only have a couple of thousand followers, and it never garnered much media attention — but presumably it made enough money for Liberty Mobile to justify a second attempt.

The biggest difference between the two companies is that Trump Mobile has placed much more emphasis on the idea that it’s manufacturing its own hardware, which Hendrickson calls a way to “differentiate” from the competition. “There’s never been an MVNO or a carrier that has built their own phone,” Hendrickson told me. Other carriers have offered branded hardware, of course — T-Mobile has had its own Revvl phones for years — but they’re built under contract by white-label manufacturers. Trump Mobile, with its “final assembly” in Miami, claims to be more directly involved.

It’s hard to square that, though, with Hendrickson’s insistence that the company is first and foremost an MVNO. When discussing the business’s future, he’s far more keen to talk about adding new phone plans and expanding the MVNO internationally than he is about building more handsets. Hendrickson calls the T1 Phone “this little thing that we wanted to do,” while Thomas says the company’s goal “is to get subscribers … the phone is a tool that helps with that.”

“We’re in the razor blade business, we’re not in the razor business,” Hendrickson says, emphasizing that Trump Mobile’s business is selling mobile plans. That’s to customers’ benefit, or so the argument goes: Because the phone isn’t the “profit center” for the company, Hendrickson says it can be sold at “a much thinner margin,” resulting in a more affordable product. I’m not convinced the Trump phone is such a good value — its updated spec sheet mostly matches other Android midrangers, many of which are cheaper, and may fall short of them depending on details like wireless charging or water resistance. The company’s refurbished Apple and Samsung phones are also clearly bad deals.

Then again, the question of value is part of why Hendrickson, Thomas, and O’Brien jumped ship from a boxer to a reality TV star-turned-president in the first place. Canelo Mobile was cheaper than Trump Mobile, even accounting for inflation. Plans were advertised starting from $15 per month, with phones from $199.99. By contrast, Trump Mobile’s only available plan is $47.45 monthly, and the T1 Phone is currently listed at $499 but expected to go up in price following its eventual launch, potentially close to double that. Trump, they explain, is a premium brand.

“You think of Trump and I immediately think of quality. I think of a higher-level brand,” Hendrickson says. “For us it’s about honoring that brand, honoring that legacy of quality and integrity.”

            <div id="article-text">Driven by both institutional mistrust and the need to go viral, Epstein theories are clogging up TikTok.

Driven by both institutional mistrust and the need to go viral, Epstein theories are clogging up TikTok.

“where are you? Are you ok , I loved the torture video,” reads one email, allegedly sent by Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. The reply, from a redacted address, states: “I am in china I will be in the US 2nd week of may.”

Her face hovering over a screenshot of the exchange, a TikTok creator claims the timing aligns with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s schedule, before speculating that the word “torture” could refer to documented abuses of Palestinian detainees. The video has drawn close to 700,000 views.

Another TikTok pushes back. Netanyahu met Chinese officials in Jerusalem — not Beijing — during that period, the second creator notes, his head resting on a pillow. The flight itinerary of the British politician Peter Mandelson flashes onto the screen, then cuts to a news clip of Sen. Lindsey Graham visiting Beijing. Graham once used a BlackBerry, that TikToker adds, pointing to the email’s “Sent from my BlackBerry” signature as potential evidence.

“Somebody is going to unearth something that’s going to crack it open,” he tells viewers.

In the comments, speculation metastasizes. “It was Bill Gates,” one user writes. “my instinct says musk,” adds another. A third replies: “No your prejustice does.”

No one was right; the address belonged to Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.

The latest trove of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice includes over 3 million documents, images, and videos obtained from probes into sex trafficking allegations against the financier and convicted sex offender. Despite heavy redactions, the files appear to bear witness to a degenerate ruling class for whom the law was optional, either partaking in or willfully ignoring his sex trafficking enterprise.

TikTok creators have swarmed the files. Thousands of clips — amassing millions of views — attempt to decode cryptic emails, dig around FBI tips, and theorize on redacted names. In the comments, people swap file numbers and repeat the call to arms: “We are unredacting.” Creators span the political spectrum and descend from various niches: true-crime enthusiasts, news junkies, conspiracy theorists, mom bloggers, wellness gurus.

The #EpsteinFiles tsunami collapses the boundaries between digital vigilantism, conspiratorial thinking, and the warped incentives of the attention economy. Whether this visibility will translate into legal accountability remains unclear. Yet beneath the spectacle lies something harder to dismiss: a genuine groundswell of outrage at the abuses detailed in the files, held together by an overarching sense that traditional justice isn’t coming, even as Congress begins reviewing the unredacted files.

Long before online sleuths began combing through the files, powerful institutions had already shown a tendency to look away.

Epstein reportedly left a severed cat’s head and a bullet on the doorstep of Vanity Fair’s editor-in-chief in the early 2000s to scare off coverage of his abuse. At ABC News, anchor Amy Robach was recorded in 2019 saying the network had “quashed” her earlier Epstein investigation (ABC claimed that there was not sufficient corroboration for broadcast), and critics have argued that initial coverage by The New York Times downplayed the scope of Epstein’s network and the systemic failures that enabled him. So, when Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown first approached former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter in 2017 about his Epstein investigation, he was unresponsive. It’d been 12 years since he’d opened the case.

“He was convinced that a lot of media had squashed the story and he was fed up,” she told WNYC. “Somebody’s going to call your publisher and the next thing you know you are going to be assigned to the obituaries department,” she said she recalled him saying.

But Brown persisted. Her 2018 investigation revealed that Epstein had abused dozens of underage girls and secured a secret, extraordinarily lenient 2008 plea deal that shielded him from federal prosecution, exposing systemic failures within the justice system. The latest files show the FBI received 290 tips relating to Epstein and his associates, and even considered charging co-conspirators but didn’t.

Her reporting led to the arrests of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell on new sex trafficking charges in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

To this day, Maxwell is the only person who has been charged in connection with the network, and she refused to answer questions in deposition before Congress on Monday, vowing to talk, and clear President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, only if he grants her clemency.

Despite Brown’s intrepid work, years of ignored police appeals have fed a broader suspicion that institutional newsrooms shield the powerful. That mistrust is measurable: Less than a third of Americans say they trust newspapers, television, and radio to report the news “fully, accurately and fairly,” according to a 2025 Gallup poll.

Into that vacuum, social media has stepped, not just as a forum for commentary, but as a heretic newsroom — one primed to treat any perceived conflict of interest as proof of collusion.

The DOJ’s latest release appears to show emails between celebrity doctor Peter Attia — who CBS News recently appointed as a new correspondent — and Epstein. In one message, Attia seemingly wrote: “Pussy is, indeed, low-carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”

Creators were quick to surface the emails and point out Attia’s recent media ties.

“I don’t think mainstream media will report on the stuff that we’re reporting on social media, because at the top, they’re all connected with the same people,” claims Nemo, a New England-based creator who asked to be identified by his first name.

The question of trust aside, the smartphone-wielding public outnumbers dwindling journalists. The same week of the release, The Washington Post announced it was laying off one-third of its editorial staff, the latest in a flurry of newsrooms to reduce its workforce. Plus, reporters face a higher journalistic standard, giving creators the advantage of speed for posting claims, both founded and completely unverified. Accelerating the urgency of social media posts is paranoia about the sudden, sporadic disappearance of files from the DOJ database.

“Frankly, there’s just too many files [for reporters]”, says TikTok creator Mick McElhinney, 36, from Syracuse, New York, who spends three or four hours reviewing the files daily.

“I had to stop reading these major institutions because I realized they were way behind the ball,” he says.

But, for better or for worse, TikTok content creators tend to be unmoored from journalistic standards and legal risks, so their content isn’t simply surfacing who features in the files.

For example: Broadcast from the car, one creator speculates that there’s a connection between journal entries from an alleged rape victim mentioning private-equity investor Leon Black and an ongoing lawsuit alleging he sexually assaulted a minor, claims which he denies. Another line of inquiry: Creators are attempting to locate Epstein’s last girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak, a 36-year-old Belarusian dentist. Documents reveal that two days before his death, Epstein gave $100 million to Shuliak.

This kind of sleuthing is known as digital vigilantism — a form of crowdsourced justice-seeking that relies on the “weaponization of visibility”: broadcasting a target’s personal details online for reputational harm.

But while this kind of sleuthing can result in actual justice (see, for instance, the internet detectives who hunted a cat-killer in the Netflix documentary Don’t F**k with Cats), there are examples like Sunil Tripathi. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, Tripathi, a 22-year-old Brown University student, found himself the object of the subreddit r/FindBostonBombers. What started with grainy surveillance footage escalated to false viral tweets announcing that police had identified Tripathi as a suspect. In fact, Tripathi had died by suicide more than a month before the bombing.

What began with the FBI asking the public for clues “morphed into a much uglier digital witch hunt, one where the crowd’s fears, prejudices, and suspicions were given credence,” Forbes wrote at the time.

Unlike that case, however, the DOJ’s Epstein files document the state’s failure to prosecute perpetrators — both in what they contain and the very act of their release. Rather than usurp law enforcement, Epstein vigilantes would argue they’re doing detective work the DOJ won’t. And unlike Tripathi, the individuals TikTok sleuths target are elites, inverting the power dynamic of one man against an angry mob.

In some ways, this activity echoes the internet’s founding philosophy: to function as a “society against the state,” encouraging the “overthrowing of hierarchies,” as French sociologist Benjamin Loveluck writes.

In the case of Epstein, “the issue of accountability must be tackled by the masses,” as put by the authors of a recent article published in the Pakistani Journal of Regional Studies Review examining the files as a remedy for governance flaws. Public scrutiny — including what they describe as “digital activism” — ensures that “no human, wealthy or mighty, can escape examination,” they bullishly argue.

The risk, however, may be uneven accountability as a result of how the files are released.

The Epstein files have been heavily redacted by the DOJ, and there’s no telling exactly who exchanged some of these emails with the infamous sex offender.

“New Brazilian just arrived, sexy and cute, 19yo,” a 2013 email to Epstein reads, sent from someone at a Paris modeling agency — but the sender’s name was redacted. An anonymous sender thanks Epstein for a “fun night” in 2014, adding: “Your littlest girl was a little naughty.”

The redacted dossier “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) wrote on X in December, following the first release.

The gaps leave room for speculation, from the informed to the outlandish, with their plausibility left to viewers to determine. For example, one theory circulating on TikTok claims the DOJ allegedly used “control+f” redacting of “Don T” based on what appears to be a redaction of the word “don’t.”

A list of alleged co-conspirators from a 2019 FBI investigation is unevenly redacted — leaving TikTok to throw out names in an attempt to fill in the gaps.

This blend of shocking revelations and cryptic redactions means that the line between interrogation and conspiracy is blurring.

In one email exchange, Epstein brags about his “aquarium full of girls,” adding: “some are like shrimp , you throw away the head and keep the body.”

One creator, armed with a handheld mic and ring light, speculates that this implies the decapitation of a victim, in a video watched 1.3 million times. “It was a cannibal holocaust,” the caption reads. In the comment section, some suggest it’s “clearly a joke” about only caring for the body, not the person, prompting dozens of replies like “wake up…they ate babies.” These exchanges are typical across “#epstein” TikTok.

It’s emails like these that feed into other theories. Hundreds of clips speculate that mentions of “pizza” and “grape soda” are coded words for pedophilia; supporters of the debunked “pizzagate” conspiracy theory claim vindication. Meanwhile, dozens of TikToks surface the same clips of Epstein with facial blisters, with green screen talking heads suggesting it’s evidence of kuru, a fatal disease caused by cannibalism. The more likely explanation? Herpes.

One of these clips has 7.5 million views. In two videos, different creators recite identical stories claiming their dad knew someone with kuru.

Other rumors include: Did Maxwell abduct missing British girl Madeleine McCann? Are those tables pictured built from babies? What about the lamps — could they be made of human skin?

Adding to the mix is the distribution of AI and false files, pulled from various corners of the internet. An image of raw chickens and a dead body on a cutting board has been viewed millions of times — despite being a piece of art from 2003. False AI-generated images appeared to show New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani as a child with his mother and Epstein, originating from a parody X account.

“There’s very explicit, damning things, there’s things that might be dark humor, there’s things that could be lies, and then there’s just a lot of really weird conversations that are divorced from the context in which they were produced,” says Alice E. Marwick, director of research at Data & Society. “It is very easy to misinterpret anything online when the utterance is divorced from intent.”

“It is very easy to misinterpret anything online when the utterance is divorced from intent.”

While these theories may be outlandish, such theorizing also makes sense. The files blend oddities — an in-house dental chair — with flashes of real horror, like an anonymous email with a redacted image attached that simply states “Age 10.” Suddenly, the unthinkable feels within reach.

The viral speculation surrounding the 2021 disappearance and homicide of Gabby Petito illustrates how crowdsourced justice on TikTok can slip into chasing engagement.

“While some videos prompted calls to police, many users shared speculation in hopes of being first to crack the case — and earn praise for doing so,” writes Bethan Jones of Cardiff University in a 2022 article about the Petito case published in The International Journal of Communication Ethics.

The TikTok algorithm works by boosting the most shock-factor content, rewarding virality over truth. This ensures that “scores of these videos are pushed into users’ ‘for you’ pages regardless of whether the person posting the video is involved in the case, is providing accurate information or is simply furthering a conspiracy theory,” Jones adds.

“The algorithm forces you to make a certain type of content, otherwise nobody would ever see it,” admits Shelli Fleming, 36. The Missouri mom of four spends up to eight hours a day sifting through the files hunting for TikTok content. Her primary goal is “advocacy for the victims,” while also “challenging whatever the mainstream narrative is,” she says.

“It’s hard, though, because in a certain aspect, I have to create content that is going to get views.”

“I have to create content that is going to get views.”

When Fleming first started her channel last summer, covering “true crime, cold cases, stuff like that,” the goal was to make money, she says.

“To monetize one-minute-long videos, it has to be pretty intriguing,” she says. Her Epstein videos speculating on what the files reveal have amassed over 5 million views and generated thousands of dollars.

“People keep coming back for it,” she says.

In addition to the risk of spreading conspiratorial thinking, turning the files into short-form video content risks retraumatizing the victims and profiting from their abuse.

Across TikTok, creators are distributing intimate images, videos, and descriptions of victims without their consent. Survivors have voiced outcry over the many instances in which the DOJ has failed to redact their identities.

Some creators have tried to identify a redacted image of a young girl they believe is the daughter of a high-profile couple in Epstein’s orbit. After finding the now-adult woman they speculate once sat on Epstein’s lap, sleuths have begun posting unsolicited comments on her social media — effectively dragging a private citizen into a viral investigation without evidence or consent.

TikTok’s algorithm also rewards content that shocks and angers, meaning the most graphic files receive the most engagement — lucrative for whoever uncovers them first.

Sociologist Nicole Bedera, author of On the Wrong Side and cofounder of the anti-violence consulting group Beyond Compliance, disagrees that this approach leads to accountability.

“When people see really violent content, they will pause for a moment before they move off of it, even if they don’t want to consume it, as sort of a trauma response to what they’re seeing. Those types of videos are not going to be the ones that lead to any kind of reckoning,” she says. Bedera recommends consuming Epstein content only from creators with a track record covering sexual violence.

Yet woven through the mass circulation of diary entries, body parts, and police reports is a genuine desire from many creators to use visibility as a form of retroactive justice — a collective want to excavate truth from systemic corruption. For participants, this work feels meaningful: a decentralized investigation driven by outrage and a dream of accountability.

“But for this type of vigilantism to work, it can’t just be throwing a name out there and hoping that the right thing will happen,” says Bedera. Instead, she argues, a coordinated online movement must be directed toward removing high-profile perpetrators from positions of power, not just exposing them.

The concern is that the online whirlwind of rage won’t be channeled in ways that translate into justice offline. Much of the content reflects a tone of deep institutional mistrust and disenfranchisement.

Creator McElhinney, from Syracuse, says watching the surge of federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota — including the shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents that has driven nationwide protests — was one of his motivations for creating Epstein-related content. To him, these are not isolated phenomena but symptoms of the same political corruption and elite impunity.

“The bad actors are the ones that are in control of the prosecutors,” he says. “The people of this country are not treating this information as prosecutorial evidence — they’re treating it as intel in a low-grade war, where things are already boiling over.”

Marwick, who studies how conspiracy theories spread online, says the current political climate — shaped by high-profile incidents of federal force and ongoing public protests — may widen the gulf between online outrage and legal accountability.

“When they’re shooting random American citizens on the street, it’s very hard to believe that there are checks and balances. We live in a time where the rule of law is tenuous, which is scary for those of us who always assume that that was immovable,” she says.

But there are signs some content may already be helping to deliver a reckoning offline. In one TikTok shared Monday night, amassing over 50,000 likes, the creator describes sending a list of file numbers to the members of Congress reviewing the unsealed documents.

On Tuesday, Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-FL) posted callouts across social media asking which files he should view unredacted. His Reddit post, since deleted, received almost 3,000 replies. But among the PDF numbers was skepticism about what comes next.

“Are you going to tell the public any of what you see in the files or is this not going to actually help expose things?” wrote one user. “Please come back after you’ve viewed the files,” urged another.

With lawmakers unveiling redacted names, the question is whether this moment becomes another binge-and-forget true-crime hype that fades away — or the start of the long, bureaucratic grind required for accountability.

“This is a trial-by-media case. I do not believe that people are going to be judicially prosecuted,” Fleming says. “But as long as the public and viewers are still interested in the content, I think it’s worth talking about.”

McElhinney pledges to make broadcasting these crimes “a lifelong task,” in what he considers to be “the worst conspiracy in human history.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132913/als-stole-this-musicians-voice-ai-sing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O’Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services.

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. And we need to be ready for what comes next. Read the full story.—Rhiannon Williams

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

This is part of our What’s Next series, which looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect. But they represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases. Read the full story. —Jessica Hamzelou

            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <h2>Anthropic’s $30B raise is about more than money</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <h2>Understanding the valuation of intangible assets in tech deals</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, M&A advisors such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

L40 is an M&A advisory firm specializing in tech deals that work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.
