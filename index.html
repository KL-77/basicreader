            <h2>Report: Imminent Apple hardware updates include MacBook Pro, iPads, and iPhone 17e</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/report-imminent-apple-hardware-updates-include-macbook-pro-ipads-and-iphone-17e/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s 2026 has already brought us the AirTag 2 and a new Creator Studio app subscription aimed at independent content creators, but nothing so far for the company’s main product families.

That could change soon, according to reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. New versions of Apple’s low-end iPhone, the basic iPad and iPad Air, and the higher-end MacBook Pros are said to be coming “imminently,” “soon,” and “shortly,” respectively, ahead of planned updates later in the year for the iPad mini, Studio Display, and other Mac models.

Here’s what we think we know about the hardware that’s coming.

Apple is apparently planning to launch an updated iPhone 17e, a new version of its basic iPhone. The phone is said to include an A19 chip similar to the one in the regular iPhone 17, and it will also add MagSafe charging. Though the iPhone 17e will likely stick to the basic one-lens camera system and the notched, Dynamic Island-less screen, it will also launch at the same $599 price as the current 16e, which counts as good news given current AI-driven RAM and storage shortages.

This would be a change in how Apple approaches its lower-end iPhone. The old iPhone SE was updated pretty sporadically, with at least a couple of years between each of its updates. The iPhone 16e was introduced just last year.

The biggest question is whether the 17e will continue to exist alongside the older but arguably superior iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which start at just $100 more than the current iPhone 16e and include a dual-lens camera system and the Dynamic Island. Having four different iPhone models available in the same $600-to-$800 price range is confusing at best.

This one’s easy: The M4 Pro and M4 Max versions of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros will be replaced by M5 Pro and M5 Max versions.

We’ve been expecting new MacBook Pros for a while now, ever since the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro launched in the fall without higher-end M5 Pro and M5 Max models. Shipping estimates for the current M4 Pro- and M4 Max-based MacBook Pros have been lengthening lately, which is sometimes a sign that manufacturing is winding down ahead of a new model.

Though larger updates to the MacBook Pro are said to be in development at Apple, including models with OLED display panels and possibly touchscreens, the M5 versions will largely stick to the same designs Apple has been using since it introduced the M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pros in late 2021.

Gurman says new Mac Studio models are also in the works, as are Mac minis, an update for the Studio Display, and the long-rumored “low-cost MacBook” that Apple is said to be planning to fill a gap in its laptop lineup. Apple has sold the old M1 MacBook Air through Walmart in the US for as low as $599 in recent years, an experiment that has apparently convinced the company that there’s room in its laptop lineup for a computer that comes in well below the $999 baseline it has used for most of its laptops over the last two decades.

Apple’s next iPad upgrades will also apparently be of the “change the processor and not much else” variety. But this will still be a relatively big deal for the basic $349 iPad, which Gurman says is stepping away from the current Apple A16 chip to an Apple A18, first seen in the iPhone 16 series in late 2024.

We can’t say for sure how much faster the A18 will be than the A16—Apple sometimes uses versions of its chips with extra CPU or GPU cores disabled for the low-end iPad—but the chip will still add Apple Intelligence support to the low-end iPad for the first time. The A16 iPad stood out among Apple’s 2025 hardware releases as one of the few that did not support Apple Intelligence. If the A18 iPad supports it, that also suggests that the iPad will come with 8GB of RAM for the first time, which will be useful for multitaskers even if you don’t care about the current slate of Apple Intelligence features or the pending “more intelligent Siri.”

The report also says Apple is preparing an iPad Air update that uses an M4 processor instead of the current M3. The M4 iPad Pro launched nearly two years ago (alongside an M2-based iPad Air), so an M4 iPad Air will hardly break any speed records. But a new chip will keep the tablet feeling reasonably fresh while we wait for a version with an updated design or a better screen.

Gurman says the iPad mini will also get an update at some point this year—among other improvements, it will allegedly switch to an OLED display panel. But it sounds like Apple is planning to launch it later in the year, sometime after the A18 iPad and the M4 iPad Air.</div>

            <h2>Why would Elon Musk pivot from Mars to the Moon all of a sudden?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As more than 120 million people tuned in to the Super Bowl for kickoff on Sunday evening, SpaceX founder Elon Musk turned instead to his social network. There, he tapped out an extended message in which he revealed that SpaceX is pivoting from the settlement of Mars to building a “self-growing” city on the Moon.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk wrote, in part.

This is simultaneously a jolting and practical decision coming from Musk.

A quarter of a century ago, Musk founded SpaceX with a single-minded goal: settling Mars. One of his longest-tenured employees, SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell, described her very first interview with Musk in 2002 to me as borderline messianic.

“He was talking about Mars, his Mars Oasis project,” Shotwell said. “He wanted to do Mars Oasis, because he wanted people to see that life on Mars was doable, and we needed to go there.”

She was not alone in this description of her first interaction with Musk. The vision for SpaceX has not wavered. Even in the company’s newest, massive Starship rocket factory at the Starbase facility in South Texas—also known as the Gateway to Mars—there are reminders of the red planet everywhere. For example, the carpet inside Musk’s executive conference room is rust red, the same color as the surface of Mars.

In the last 25 years Musk has gone from an obscure, modestly wealthy person to the richest human being ever, from a political moderate to chief supporter of Donald Trump; from a respected entrepreneur to, well, to a lot of things to a lot of people: world’s greatest industrialist/super villain/savant/grifter-fraudster.

But one thing that has remained constant across the Muskiverse has been his commitment to “extending the light of human consciousness” and to the belief that the best place to begin humanity’s journey toward becoming a multi-planetary species was Mars.

We cannot know Musk’s full rationale for pivoting to the Moon, at least in the near term. Only a year ago he referred to the Moon as a “distraction.” But now, apparently, it’s not. What we can do is look at what has changed in the last 13 months.

The first change is that the one company with the potential to seriously challenge SpaceX in spaceflight over the next decade, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, has finally started to deliver. The company has now flown, and landed, its New Glenn rocket. Multiple sources have told Ars that Bezos has told his team to go “all in” on lunar exploration. This includes development of a crew transportation system, Blue Moon Mark 1.5, that does not require orbital refueling. This raises the possibility that Blue Origin might land humans on the Moon before Starship, a threat sources at Starbase say SpaceX is beginning to take seriously.

The other major change is Musk’s obsession with artificial intelligence and his view that AI and space are increasingly intertwined in their ambitions. SpaceX and xAI recently merged, and a major focus of Musk going forward will be to construct orbital data centers to provide enormous computing resources for his vision of humanity’s online future.

He has also spoken increasingly of becoming a Kardashev-level civilization, a reference to a Soviet astronomer who conceived that humanity would advance by first being able to tap and store all energy sources available on its planet, and then by directly collecting a star’s energy through technology like a Dyson sphere. Musk has also made frequent references on social media to building a “mass driver” on the Moon.

All of this may sound like it’s straight out of the pages of a science fiction novel, and it pretty much is. But the reality is that the Moon has reliable stores of oxygen and silicon, and building a catapult-like mechanism on the airless world would be an efficient way to move materials into space to build large orbital factories, data centers, solar farms, or even O’Neill cylinders.

In this, Musk is starting to sound a lot more like Bezos when it comes to his vision for human habitation in space, rather than the Mars-first advocate he has always been.

One other sobering thing to think about in terms of a lunar mass-driver: it is potentially an extremely potent weapon to threaten Earth with large projectiles. We cannot know if Musk has had any conversations with US military officials about this, but anyone who has read The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein will understand Luna’s position as the ultimate high ground. And the US Space Force is not ignorant of this.

In the short-term, it does not mean a whole lot. To anyone paying attention, SpaceX was not on track to send a Starship to Mars in 2026, and the 2028 window was looking rather unlikely as well. Mars was always in the distance, and now it will remain so.

By focusing on the Moon, Musk is making a decision that benefits NASA and the United States. Because for all of Blue Origin’s promise with a slimmed down lunar lander, Starship offers a promising avenue to return humans to the Moon in the near term.

Another advantage of Starship is its enormous payload capacity, able to bring 100 metric tons, or more, of cargo down to the Moon. For anyone seeking to build a commercial business on the Moon, Musk’s 180-degree pivot represents an enormous opportunity.

For Mars advocates, however, Musk’s turn is a bitter pill to swallow. There have long been many dreamers who spoke of settling Mars, but only Musk actually built the hardware and financial war chest to make such dreams a reality. And it is true that, in the long-term, Mars offers a more favorable (although still inhospitable) environment for human settlement, with a thin atmosphere, water ice both on the surface and beneath the ground, methane, and more.

But those dreams are now deferred as Musk has bowed to a harsh reality: The Moon may be hard, but it is a lot easier to develop than Mars, which is only accessible every 26 months when the planets align.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Sure, most Americans are glued to their TVs for today’s Super Bowl and/or the Winter Olympics. But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space.

As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise:

Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone.

In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky.

To say there’s a lot of interest in this movie might be an understatement. The first trailer was released in June and racked up a whopping 400 million views worldwide in its first week. The footage—which included Ryland discovering an alien ship inhabited by the aforementioned Rocky—gave every indication of following Weir’s novel pretty closely. That’s very good news for Weir fans, which includes several of us here at Ars.

That earlier trailer mostly gave us a lot of backstory about how Ryland ended up reluctantly agreeing to the mission, with just a few glimpses of Rocky. But Rocky is front and center for this latest one. The footage focuses on how Ryland and Rocky learn to communicate and gradually bond over their shared fates, with strains of Prince’s “I Would Die For You” echoing in the background. It starts with Rocky imitating Ryland’s body motions, including a goofy hero pose. Eventually Ryland figures out how to synthesize a voice for Rocky so they can better coordinate their strategies. Will they succeed? Or is this a one-way trip for one or both of them?

Project Hail Mary hits theaters on March 20, 2026.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/under-trump-epas-enforcement-of-environmental-laws-collapses-report-finds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group.

By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.

Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.

“Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.

The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump.

From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air, and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration.

At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in US history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment.

Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.

Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures.

“Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a December 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices.

Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote.

Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode.

Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators.

One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action.

“But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.”

Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021.

The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report.

However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email.

Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads.

Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report.

“We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.”

The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters.

Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added.

“Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less-efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide the desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.

According to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.

“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”

Five hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.

“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.

The subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.

“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.

As DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.

“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”

When uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.

When Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”

“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”

Credit where it’s due, though: Google delayed handing over Jon’s data long enough for the ACLU to challenge the subpoena on his behalf, though it didn’t explain why. Of course, that meant DHS agents still tracked down his address some other way — part of a growing trend of federal agencies surveilling and harassing random people who haven’t even been arrested, let alone convicted of a crime.

            <div id="article-text">Health professionals have long had to deal with patients who inadvisably shoved a whole range of foreign objects up their behinds, often requiring medical intervention to retrieve them.

It’s a surprisingly common issue. According to a 2023 study, there are around 4,000 cases a year of both male and female individuals visiting emergency departments for what the researchers euphemistically termed “rectal foreign bodies.”

Now, in a twist to the age-old story that even the writing room of “Grey’s Anatomy” couldn’t have come up with, a man in France was rushed to the operating room after staffers at the Rangueil Hospital in Toulouse found out he had shoved a 37mm brass-and-copper “collectible shell” that was used by the Imperial German Army during World War 1 up his rectum.

As Agence France-Presse reports, officials had to call in a bomb disposal team and evacuate the hospital after the man was admitted over the weekend. Firefighters were called in as well to “ensure fire protection during the bomb disposal team’s intervention.”

Fortunately, emergency teams later confirmed that the “explosive device has been neutralized,” ending the unusual incident.

The unnamed man is 24 years old and could be facing legal action for handling “category A munitions,” an officer told the Daily Mail.

Beyond being found inside people’s rectums, around 1.5 billion shells were fired during World War 1, according to the Military Times. The ordnances are still being collected to this day.

Amazingly, it’s somehow not the first time a Frenchman has been rushed to the hospital after shoving a shell up his behind. In late 2022, an 88-year-old stuck a World War 1 artillery shell in his rectum; surgeons at a hospital in Toulon, France, were forced to make an incision in his abdomen to retrieve the ancient relic.

The discovery was understandably a major surprise at the time.

“An apple, a mango, or even a can of shaving foam, we are used to finding unusual objects inserted where they shouldn’t be,” one ER doctor told French newspaper Var-Matin. “But a shell? Never!”

In an even more potentially dangerous ploy, a man in England managed to lodge a two-inch wide World War 2 anti-tank shell where the Sun don’t shine, forcing a hospital in Gloucester to also call in a bomb disposal team.

The man told officials at the time that he allegedly “slipped and fell” on the ordnance.

            <div id="article-text">Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs have become an enormously popular way to lose weight. And with generic, much cheaper versions of the medications on the horizon, their use could soon grow even further.

But apart from being a clinically proven way to shed pounds — at least temporarily — along with a whole constellation of other health benefits, the drugs also turn out to be a major strain on the environment.

As detailed in a new paper published in the journal Nature Sustainability, researchers from the University of Melbourne investigated how the process of producing peptides — short chains of amino acids that aren’t just used for GLP-1 agonists, but plenty of other drugs and treatments as well — releases huge amounts of organic solvents and other plastic byproducts that don’t break down on their own in nature.

Fortunately, the researchers say they’ve come up with a much more environmentally friendly procedure that could make producing peptide-based treatments far more sustainable in the long-run.

So far, they’ve been manufactured using a technique called “solid phase peptide synthesis,” or SPPS, which anchors the first amino acid building block to a synthetic resin, such as polystyrene beads. Toxic solvents — including dimethylformamide, a component of paint strippers — are then used to add each amino acid one by one, which can then leak into the water supply.

The scale of the issue is considerable. As the lead author of the Nature Sustainability paper and University of Melbourne chemistry professor John Wade wrote in a piece about his research, the annual production of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight loss drugs such as Ozempic, is currently generating upwards of 123 million pounds of toxic solvent waste. And that’s just one of more than 80 peptide-based drugs on the market.

The materials involved are also expensive and difficult to get rid of, thanks to tight environmental regulations.

“Why are we still making life-saving medicines using chemical processes that produce mountains of toxic waste, and could water — the cleanest and most familiar solvent of all — offer a way out?” Wade asked rhetorically.

In response, the researcher and his colleagues came up with a water-based solution to synthesize peptides. By pairing amino acids with specific salts, they found they could overcome limitations associated with SPPS, allowing them to dissolve them in water “at high concentrations while remaining fully functional.”

An activating agent combined with a biodegradable material could allow for “efficient peptide synthesis entirely in water,” the professor argued.

It remains to be seen whether the process can be scaled up industrially, but given the wide proliferation of GLP-1 agonists, it’s critical to investigate ways of making manufacturing processes more sustainable.

“What began as a shared concern among three long-time international collaborators has become an exciting technology with the potential to reshape how some of the most important medicines of our time are made,” Wade wrote. “Cleanly, responsibly and ready for the future.”

            <h2>Jeffrey Epstein Had a Bizarre Obsession With “Improving” Human DNA, and He Was Emailing With Top Scientists About It</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jeffrey Epstein had a bizarre obsession with genetics and “improving” human DNA — and he was corresponding with top scientists to make his fantasies a reality.

The newly released documents from the Justice Department shine additional light on how the convicted child sex criminal exhibited a fascination with transhumanism, a controversial movement in science and philosophy with a eugenicist mission: using cutting edge technology, including genetic engineering and AI, to advance the biology of the human race. They also reinforce how serious Epstein was about pursuing these ideas, which he tossed around among his shockingly wide network of intellectuals, many of whom communicated with him long after he had pled guilty to child prostitution charges in 2008.

To ingratiate himself with top scientists, the deceased billionaire offered to fund their research and held expensive research conferences and parties. In 2006, he organized a conference on St Thomas in the British Virgin Islands — not far from his notorious “Epstein Island” — attended by luminaries including physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne. Even though the subject was supposed to be about the theory of gravity, the New York Times reported that one attendee recalled that all Epstein wanted to talk about was improving the human genome, and how the passing of certain traits might result in superior humans.

Epstein harbored myriad racist beliefs, including the idea that Black people’s genetics made them less intelligent. In 2016, Epstein emailed German cognitive scientist and then-MIT-professor Joscha Bach, indicating that he was interested in the idea of genetically modifying Black people to make them “smarter,” The Telegraph found. Bach had received a roughly $400,000 donation from Epstein. In a 2016 email exchange with leftist thinker Noam Chomsky, Epstein claimed that “the test score gap amongst African Americans is well documented,” and was adamant that a “set of genes used for working memory” could be “found and adjusted.”

Epstein also wanted to invest in research pursuing genetically modifying embryos to produce children with desirable traits, The Telegraph also spotted. He seriously entertained the idea in a 2018 email exchange — Subject: “Designer babies” — with crypto entrepreneur Bryan Bishop, who asked Epstein about securing funding. “i have no issue with investing,” Epstein responded.

As it happened, Epstein wanted children of his own — and lots of them. The 2019 NYT reporting details how Epstein had planned to “seed” the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his 33,000 square-foot ranch in New Mexico, and discussed the idea with multiple top scientists (who chose to remain anonymous). One of the scientists allegedly claimed that Epstein wanted to impregnate 20 women at a time.

Epstein also had a creepy obsession with using genetics to improve women’s sex drives. He repeatedly discussed the idea with former Stanford human biology professor Nathan Wolfe in email exchanges between 2008 and 2013, Stanford Daily found, in which they mused over the possibility of developing a “female viagra.”

Wolfe, perhaps even more so than Epstein, was serious about making it happen. In May 2013, he wrote to Epstein enthusing that their “horny virus hypothesis” could be correct. He claimed that he’d come up with a study “directly linking sexual behavior and microbial diversity,” and asked for Epstein’s thoughts about his “funding on this hypothesis.”

“I think it hits the sweet spot of what we’ve been thinking about (so to speak),” Wolfe added.

Another scientist that Epstein confided with was Martin Nowak, a math and biology professor at Harvard University. Nowak was known for his work on using mathematics to describe the evolution of the human language and how certain human behaviors emerged. In light of everything above, it’s not hard to see why Epstein took such a strong interest in his work: in 2003, the billionaire donated $30 million to Harvard to support Nowak’s research.

Nowak’s connection to Epstein is well documented. But the newly released documents additionally revealed an ominous sounding email to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s partner — and alleged partner in crime. “i am so very sorry i caused you so much worry and that i spoilt this day. i am so happy that i did not kill anybody,” he wrote in a 2002 email. “my perspective of life has changed somehow.” In 2014, Epstein sent a cryptic email to Nowak stating, “our spy was captured after completing her mission.” Nowak responded: “did you torture her.”

            <h2>Scientists Say Heck, Just Nuke a Killer Asteroid Heading for Earth</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plenty of asteroids can survive their fiery plunge through the Earth’s atmosphere. If they’re big enough, they can prove incredibly destructive, like the 60-foot Chelyabinsk meteor that exploded over the southern Ural region in Russia in 2013, releasing a blast equivalent to 30 times the energy of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.

And in case an even larger space rock were to ever threaten humanity, we’d have to get creative to keep it from colliding with our planet. Crashing a spacecraft into it like a pool ball to redirect its path — just like NASA did with its proof of concept Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission in 2022 — may not always be on the table, given the many uncertainties involved.

In a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications, an international team of researchers — including scientists from CERN and the University of Oxford — revisited the idea of blowing up an incoming asteroid with a nuclear warhead.

There are intuitive concerns. What if the asteroid shattered, turning a cosmic sniper shot into a shotgun blast of debris raining down over our planet?

But the team used CERN’s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to study how asteroid materials react to different levels of physical stress, including large-scale simulations of nuclear deflection, and found that the space rocks are surprisingly resilient.

“Planetary defense represents a scientific challenge,” said Karl-Georg Schlesinger, cofounder of nuclear deflection startup Outer Solar System Company (OuSoCo), which partnered with the scientists, in a statement. “The world must be able to execute a nuclear deflection mission with high confidence, yet cannot conduct a real-world test in advance.”

In an experiment, the team exposed samples of a metal-rich meteorite to 27 short but intense pulses of a proton beam at CERN’s HiRadMat facility. Afterward, the team moved the meteorite to the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK to analyze changes to its internal structure at a microscopic level.

To their surprise, the “material became stronger, exhibiting an increase in yield strength, and displayed a self-stabilizing damping behavior,” explained OuSoCo cofounder Melanie Bochmann.

The finding could have major implications for how we approach future asteroid redirection efforts.

“Our experiments indicate that — at least for metal-rich asteroid material — a larger device than previously thought can be used without catastrophically breaking the asteroid,” Bochmann said. “This keeps open an emergency option for situations involving very large objects or very short warning times, where non-nuclear methods are insufficient and where current models might assume fragmentation would limit the usable device size.”

Fortunately, the researchers could soon have far more data to go by. Both NASA and the European Space Agency are planning to study Apophis, an enormous asteroid somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 feet in width, which is expected to come eerily close to the Earth — closer than many geosynchronous satellites at just 20,000 miles — to Earth in April 2029.

“As a next step, we plan to study more complex and rocky asteroid materials,” the researchers said in a statement. “One example is a class of meteorites called pallasites, which consist of a metal matrix similar to the meteorite material we have already studied, with up to centimeter-sized magnesium-rich crystals embedded inside.”

The upcoming research could have fascinating implications outside of asteroid redirection as well.

“Because these objects are thought to originate from the core–mantle boundary of early planetesimals,” they added, “such experiments could also provide valuable insights into planetary formation processes.”

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Suspicious as the circumstances surrounding his death may have been, there’s a broad consensus that Jeffrey Epstein did in fact die in 2019.

Unless, that is, you’re the type of person that believes everything you see on X, in which case the convicted child sex offender is alive and well in Israel, where he spends his free time pubstomping scrubs in Fortnite.

This appears to be something people actually believe, stemming from the discovery of what might be Epstein’s YouTube account in the latest batch of files. A receipt sent to his email for a movie purchased on the platform — Alfred Hitchcock’s “Frenzy” — revealed the username “littlestjeff1.” Amateur sleuths then discovered a Fortnite account with the same account name, which online trackers showed was based in Israel and active as recently as 2025. Conspiracy theories ensued, going viral on X.

So Epstein is still among the living? Not according to Fortnite’s team, which says this is just some prankster’s idea of a sick joke.

“Hey Official Fortnite here — this was a ruse by a Fortnite player,” the account said. “A few days ago, an existing Fortnite account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube. These Fortnite trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it.”

“We have no record of the subject’s email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system,” the statement added. “Since the public document releases, people have created Fortnite accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”

The conspiracy theorists were perhaps fueled by Epstein’s apparent ties to the Israeli government, including frequent correspondence with former prime minister and minister of defense Ehud Barak. And not backing down from the official Fortnite narrative, they claim that one of the files shows a receipt of Epstein purchasing V-Bucks, Fortnite’s in-game currency, in 2019.

But that isn’t the case. There appears to be only one reference to V-Bucks in the files, and it’s an email with a redacted sender and recipient sent in May 2019 clarifying that there was a $25.95 charge for the Fortnite currency. And it’s referenced as “VBucks,” not its proper hyphenated name. The email is not an actual receipt, and it doesn’t show it was sent to Epstein.

“Someone’s been having fun renaming their Fortnite account,” wrote Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, “but it’s recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive.”

What’s more interesting than this latest conspiracy theory is the fact that Fortnite felt compelled to clear the air at all — a sure sign of how high-strung everyone is feeling about Epstein’s wide web of deep connections.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/discord-to-roll-out-age-verification-next-month-for-full-access-to-its-platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Discord is rolling out age verification globally starting next month, the company announced on Monday. All users will be put into a “teen-appropriate experience” by default unless they prove they’re adults. Age verification will be required to change certain settings and access age-restricted content.

Discord users will need to be confirmed as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting, and only adults can access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands. Additionally, messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and only verified adults can modify this setting.

People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know, and only adults will be able speak on stage in servers.

To complete age verification, users need to either complete a facial age estimation or submit an ID to Discord’s vendor partners. The platform plans to add more options in the future. Discord notes that some users may be asked to use multiple methods when additional information is needed to assign an age group.

The facial age estimation requires video selfies, which Discord says never leave your device. Additionally, the company says IDs submitted to its vendor partners are deleted quickly, and in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.

“Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility,” said Savannah Badalich, head of product policy at Discord, in a press release. “We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform.”

Discord’s global launch of age verification follows the company’s decision to establish age checks for users in the U.K. and Australia last year.

The announcement mirrors similar moves made by other online platforms, reflecting growing international efforts to strengthen child safety. Most recently, Roblox introduced mandatory facial verification for access to chats on its platform. Last July, YouTube launched its age-estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience.

Discord’s age-verification changes will begin in early March, and both new and existing users will need to verify their age to access age-restricted content.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uber has agreed to acquire the delivery business of Turkey’s Getir, once one of the biggest success stories of the country’s startup ecosystem, the company announced on Monday

The deal will see Uber paying $335 million at the outset to purchase Getir’s food delivery business. The ride-hailing giant will also pay $100 million for a 15% stake in Getir’s grocery, retail and water delivery business, and said it would complete the acquisition of the division over the next few years.

Uber is buying the business from Getir’s biggest shareholder, the Emirati sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The investment firm was reportedly seeking to sell its stake in the company last year.

The deal comes after a turbulent few years for Getir, which once enjoyed a valuation of $12 billion, that saw the startup scale down its operations massively. The company launched to great traction in 2015, and invested aggressively to expand its operations in the U.S. and Europe, both organically and via acquisitions, especially during the pandemic.

But after the pandemic lockdowns eased, broader consumer demand for food and grocery delivery also wavered, and Getir chose to cut its losses in 2024, shutting shop and laying off thousands of staff in the U.S., U.K, and Europe in order to focus on business back home.

Nearly a year ago, the company went through a struggle for control over a restructuring plan proposed by Mubadala. The plan was opposed by one of Getir’s co-founders, who eventually sued to fight the “illegal coup,” but a Dutch court rejected the founder’s appeals.

The company has raised a total of $2.40 billion so far, according to PitchBook. Documents filed by Getir in court last year show the company valued its group assets at $374 million.

“This transaction reflects the strength of the business and the progress it has made, particularly over the last year,” Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, deputy group CEO at Mubadala, said in a statement.

Uber said it would combine the new unit’s services with Trendyol Go, a food and grocery delivery service in Turkey that the ride-hail giant bought for $700 million last May. Uber said Getir’s food delivery business alone recorded gross bookings of more than $1 billion in 2025, up 50% from a year earlier.

The deal follows a strong showing by Uber’s delivery business in the fourth quarter, reporting revenue of $4.89 billion, up 30% from a year earlier. The company said Europe, Middle-East and Asia proved the fastest-growing region for the business in 2026.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gather AI, a startup that offers an AI platform for warehouse cameras and drones, has raised a $40 million Series B funding round led by Smith Point Capital. That’s the VC firm founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block.

The Gather team first met Smith Point a year ago at a logistics conference, and “it took Keith and his team five minutes to get what we’re doing,” co-founder and CEO Sankalp Arora told TechCrunch.

What Gather AI is doing is unusual. The four founders met as PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University, where they built one of the first autonomous helicopters and tested it on the FBI training grounds in Quantico. (Block is a trustee for CMU.)

In 2017, the founders took what they learned about teaching helicopters to fly and land safely and launched Gather AI. Using off-the-shelf cameras placed on strategic moving equipment like forklifts, as well as off-the-shelf drones flying around the warehouse, the cameras watch on-the-floor operations and log what they find into the warehouse management systems.

But the catch is, the AI isn’t being random about what it scans. It is being “curious,” as Arora described it.

“My PhD work focused on how to make different kinds of flying robots curious,” he said. “So they’re curious about boxes and bar codes and workflows.”

In addition to barcodes, they look for lot codes, text, expiration dates, case counts, damages, occupancy, and other items. The idea is that they will discover and predict issues like low inventory, misplaced stock, and workflows that may cause safety issues.

They also work in environments unfriendly to people, like freezers and cold storage.

Because Gather’s underlying tech was built years before the age of large language models, this is not the kind of AI that an LLM uses.

“They’re not end-to-end neural networks,” Arora explains. “They are classical Bayesian techniques, combined with neural networks.”

AI vision Bayesian techniques use probability-base methods to teach computers how to interpret visual data. These systems allow the technology to learn by using data and prior knowledge to make decisions — meaning they don’t suffer the hallucination problems of LLMs.

Instead they “get curious,” as Arora put it, to gather information (hence the startup’s name) and make a decision on the next action based on what they’ve learned.

As old-school as that sounds, Gather AI is sitting at the edge of the next big thing in AI, sometimes called “embodied AI.” These are robots that interact with the real world, as opposed to an LLM interacting via computer chat or web app.

To that end, in December, the startup won the 2025 Nebius Robotics award for Vision AI and Streaming Video Analytics. (Nebius is a Netherlands company that provides AI infrastructure.)

Gather currently employs about 60 people, Arora said, and customers include Kwik Trip, Axon, GEODIS, and NFI Industries. With this fresh funding, the startup has now raised $74 million total. Other investors include Bain Capital Ventures, XRC Ventures, and Hillman Investments.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a better-than-expected opening weekend in theaters, box office for Amazon’s “Melania” fell 67%, to an estimated $2.37 million, in its second weekend.

The documentary about First Melania Trump has grossed a total of $13.5 million so far (almost all of that in the United States), which means it’s extremely unlikely the film — which Amazon spent $40 million to acquire and $35 million to market — will break even in theaters.

Before “Melania”’s release, a former Amazon film executive asked how the price tag could be motivated by anything other than “currying favor” with the Trump administration or “an outright bribe.”

Moviegoing typically slows during Super Bowl weekend, but the weekend’s top film, “Send Help,” only declined 47%. And after placing third on the charts last weekend, “Melania” is ninth this time.

Perhaps anticipating discussion about the film’s decline, Amazon released a statement from its head of domestic theatrical distribution Kevin Wilson, who said, “Together, theatrical and streaming represent two distinct value creating moments that amplify the film’s overall impact.”

“Melania” received universally negative reviews from critics, but its 99% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes was so good that the site put out a statement insisting that the score was real.

            <h2>Greenlanders Are Ready to Fight</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Greenlanders own a lot of guns: more than 35,000 long rifles, on an island of 56,000 people. Everyone I met there in January knew how to hunt. And more than one person made clear to me that they were ready to stand their ground against a possible American invasion.

“I have 10 hunting rifles,” Finn told me when I visited his home in Nuuk. (He asked me to withhold his full name because “taking credit for things is not the Greenland way.”)  “I am a decent shot,” he added, “but not as good as my friends, who can hit a seal in the water at 200 meters, from a moving boat.”

Nuuk, a city of no more than 20,000 people, is serviced by one of very few runways in a wilderness more than three times the size of Texas. Finn was born there, to a Danish father and an Inuit mother. “You must know,” he told me—after we’d sat for an hour or so over tea and salted musk ox, and he had come to trust that I was not one of the “other” Americans—“that I will defend my home.”

The “other” Americans had also been to visit. In early 2025, right-wing influencers roamed downtown Nuuk, handing out $100 bills to children and telling them to pose for cameras while wearing free MAGA swag. I, too, encountered a group of children—on a climb up the tallest hill (in Ohio we would call it a mountain) overlooking the capital. Four kids scampered past. “We don’t like Trump!” they said on hearing my accent.

Looking down on the airfield below, I was struck by the forbidding topography. Steep, snow-covered mountains flanked the icy fjords. The word that came to mind was desolate. Jacob Kaarsbo, one of my climbing companions, was a former Danish intelligence officer and an expert on Greenland’s defense.

“There are only a handful of runways that we have to defend,” he told me. “And in the north,” he added, “there are villages where the next living soul is 1,000 miles away.” Danish special forces maintain a presence in those wild expanses. Monthslong expeditions known as Sirius Patrol rely on sled-dog teams, and serve to remind any interloper that Greenland is not for the taking.

President Trump recently mocked the sled-dog teams. But in the frozen North, the only vehicles that can operate reliably are sleds pulled by dogs. People have tried using machines, but the cold turns oil to sludge, and when machines fall through ice, they can’t be pulled out. If a sled breaks through, it floats long enough to be recovered. If dogs and men fall through, they pull themselves out, drag their sleds onto thicker ice, and carry on.

Two hours north of the capital sits a fishing village accessible only by boat. We left Nuuk’s port before sunrise, and once we were in the fjord, we navigated past slabs of ice until we reached the settlement. Most of Greenland’s inhabitants live in towns like this: a one-room schoolhouse, a chapel, a lone medic equipped to treat only minor injuries. Anyone with a serious health issue has to be evacuated to Nuuk by boat. As we approached the dock, a small hunting party was casting off.

The village may be one of the most isolated in the world. But even there, people asked me: “What does America want?” By their reckoning, Greenlanders already provided everything the United States could want. “Is it true,” one of the villagers asked, “that your president has a ‘psychological need’ to own us?” Some in the village wanted to believe that Trump had never said this, that the reports were fake.

Throughout the settlement, I noticed animal carcasses nailed to the sides of homes. Most were small game—birds and hares—but I also saw a quartered reindeer. This was the local method of refrigeration, and the villagers survived on subsistence hunting. I found myself thinking about the gun culture back home—performative, based on a myth of self-sufficiency. In this Greenlandic village, gun ownership was rooted in the requirements of an unforgiving environment. Walking back to the boat, I saw a blood trail that led up from the dock. The hunting party had been successful.

Trump’s posture toward Greenland has had a very real impact on the people who live there. Three nights before my visit, the power failed in Nuuk. One woman I spoke with was convinced that the Americans were coming. Many of her friends thought the same. “Venezuela,” she said. “The first thing the Americans did was cut the power.” The next morning, calls to the mental-health crisis line in Nuuk spiked.

Part of me wondered whether this was an overreaction. Then Orla Joelsen, a local guide, showed me a building that sat mostly empty in the center of town.

“It is waiting,” Joelsen said, “for the Americans.”

The U.S. government has long maintained a minimal presence in Nuuk: one permanent consular representative and a handful of other staff. That has been more than enough for as long as anyone can remember. Now the U.S. has leased this new building, which it has yet to occupy, and which covers tens of thousands of square feet, with enough office space for more than 100 people. To the locals, the facility looms as the likely headquarters for a coming occupation.

The Greenlanders I met will not submit easily. They seemed ready to fight, and more than capable. Greenlandic and Danish authorities were also preparing. Warships from Denmark arrived at the harbor during my visit. My guide told me that until recently, he had never seen guards at the port, where heavily armed Danish soldiers now checked vehicles entering and leaving. “It is not because of the Russians,” Joelsen said. “It is because of the Americans.”

In late January, the Greenlandic government posted an alert advising all residents to prepare to “fend for yourself for five days if a crisis arises.” The notice included recommendations on stockpiling medicine, batteries, and fuel, as well as tips on surviving without power or water. Similar circulars have been issued before, in anticipation of major storms and other natural events. But this one included something new: “Consider access to hunting weapons.” That was a call to arms.

“The more people who can fend for themselves and help others, the stronger we stand as a society,” the alert added. “Do what you can and help those around you. Fortunately, we are good at that.”

In Nuuk, stores were running low on ammunition, not because people were afraid of one another, nor because they needed that much ammo to hunt. “The bullets are for the Americans,” one local told me, “if they come.” He assured me that the government was working to replenish the depleted ammunition supply.

The Greenlanders I met were warm and welcoming, but not without a fierce pride. Their ancestors had carved a civilization out of the ice with tools made from whalebone and meteorite fragments. They’d hewn garments from cured whale intestine, sealskin, and thick polar-bear fur—still the warmest insulation on Earth. Today’s Greenlanders are prepared to defend what they have built here.

“If we are pushed,” Finn told me, “we are ready to die.”

That’s a fight America has no reason to pick. It’s also one that America could lose.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the winter of 168 C.E., the famed Greek physician Galen arrived in Aquileia, an Italian city on the northern edge of the Adriatic. The city had grown large since its founding as a Roman colony, but during the 200-year Pax Romana, its fortifications had been allowed to deteriorate. After an armed group of migrating Germanic peoples had crossed the Danube a year earlier, the Roman co-emperors, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, had rushed to the city, raising two legions and rebuilding its defenses; they planned to use it as a base of operations against the invaders.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Galen had been summoned, however, to help fight a different kind of invader. A plague, likely an early variant of smallpox, had traveled to Aquileia with the troops, and held the city in its grip. The emperors fled, but Verus succumbed to the disease on the road to Rome. Galen tried to slow the wave of illness, but most of the people in Aquileia perished.

They represented just a sliver of the eventual victims of the Antonine Plague, also known as Galen’s Plague, which killed at least 1 million people throughout the Roman empire. It was possibly the world’s first true pandemic, and haunted the empire for the rest of the Pax Romana, which ended in 180 with Aurelius’s death. The details of the pandemic—the exact pathogen, the true number of victims—are subjects of debate, and might never be fully settled. But some research has cited the Antonine Plague as part of a vicious cycle that hastened Rome’s long fall. Food shortages, internal migrations, and overcrowding had already signaled a slippage in imperial power, and created a fertile environment for disease. The pandemic, in turn, spread panic and left behind mistrust, weakening faith in civic and religious authorities.

Men famously think about Rome every day, and political commentators have been nervously comparing Rome’s fall to a potential American collapse since before America even had a Constitution. But Rome’s example really does merit consideration in light of recent events. One of the better measures of a society’s vitality is its ability to protect its citizens from disease, and the two often move in tandem; a decline in one may produce a reduction in the other.

Infectious disease is probably not an imminent threat to the United States’ survival. Still, after nearly a century of existence, the American public-health apparatus, which has driven some of the most remarkable advances in global longevity and quality of life in human history, is teetering. The country has lost much of its ability to keep microbes from invading its body politic, and progress in life expectancy and other metrics is slowing or even reversing.

It is tempting to lay these changes all at the feet of President Trump and his current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who together have shredded America’s global-health organizations, drawn back public-health funding, fomented vaccine skepticism, and begun to dismantle child-vaccination programs. But the “Make America Healthy Again” moment is in some ways just another step in the long retreat of the civic trust and communitarian spirit that have enabled America’s disease-fighting efforts. If this retreat continues, the public-health era—the century-long period of unprecedented epidemiological safety that has been the foundation for so many other breakthroughs—will come to an end. And that end will have dire consequences for this republic and its future.

In January 2025, a hospital in West Texas began reporting that children were coming in sick with measles. The cases were initially clustered in a Mennonite community, where vaccination rates had been low in recent decades. But soon the outbreak spread around the state, and to others; the reported number of cases reached more than 1,800 by the year’s end. As of this writing, the outbreak is still ongoing, and America is in danger of having its measles-elimination status revoked by the World Health Organization.

On August 8, as the measles outbreak continued to make headlines, a man named Patrick Joseph White entered a CVS in northeast Atlanta and fired hundreds of rounds from a rifle into the CDC’s headquarters across the street. According to Georgia investigators, White had been suicidal, and believed that COVID‑19 vaccines were part of a conspiracy to sicken him and other Americans.

These were but two signs among many that something has broken within the systems that protect the population’s health. Despite all of our advantages, the coronavirus pandemic caused more confirmed deaths per capita in the United States than in any other Western country, and our mortality rate’s recovery has lagged behind others’. Life expectancy in the U.S. is lower than in other high-income nations, and the gulf is widening.

America is unique, and comparisons are difficult. The country easily outpaces the rest of the developed world in gun deaths and overdoses, both major mortality drivers here that have largely been accepted as the cost of being American. But even if you discount those peculiarities, plenty of other indicators are pointing the wrong way. Foodborne illnesses appear to be on the rise, including regular surges of norovirus. Deteriorating water-delivery and sewage systems have contributed to a growing number of outbreaks of legionella. Cases of tetanus, whooping cough, and hepatitis A have also risen in recent years.

Many problems contribute to these shifts—insufficient investments in infrastructure, budget cuts in state and local health departments, the growing drug resistance of bacteria. Yet underlying all of the outbreaks, and even gun and opioid deaths, is a common theme: a declining sense of mutual responsibility among Americans. If the population could be analogized to a single human body, then its immune system would rely on a concert of action and purpose between each cell. When that concert stops, the body dies.

In 1946, the year the U.S. Public Health Service founded its Communicable Disease Center, American life expectancy at birth was about 66 years. Malaria was rampant in the South, and fever diseases, tuberculosis, syphilis, and polio killed tens of thousands of Americans annually. Thirty-four out of every 1,000 children born in 1946 were expected to die before their first birthday, many from communicable diseases. America was moving toward modernity, but the risks people faced were of a different order than they are today.

The CDC (since renamed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) inherited much of its early mandate from a U.S. military campaign to control infectious diseases among soldiers fighting in World War II. The scale of the war effort had necessitated the creation of a health infrastructure on American soil—spraying for mosquitoes near the front lines in the Pacific wouldn’t mean anything if soldiers caught malaria at home before deployment. Responses to outbreaks near bases needed to be big and fast enough to account for car travel beyond military jurisdictions. When the CDC took over, it extended this paradigm—of coordination across long distances and disparate communities—to the civilian population.

From the June 2020 issue: Vann R. Newkirk II on how America handles catastrophe

The same year the CDC was created, the influenza vaccine reached the public, and international organizations, supported by the U.S., began a global push to eliminate tuberculosis. The agency worked to promote mass vaccination. It began a national disease-surveillance program, and shared intelligence with cash-strapped county health departments and state agencies. Wartime campaigns to coax and chide Americans into doing their part to conserve resources and volunteer for the war effort translated easily into pushes for vaccination and sanitation.

Before 1946, conquering disease would have seemed as much a subject of science fiction as putting a man on the moon. But since 1950, global life expectancy has risen by four years each decade. Smallpox has been eradicated, and polio and malaria cases have dramatically fallen. Within the past 80 years, there have perhaps been more significant advances in human health than there were in the previous 300,000.

On the home front, several generations have grown up on an American mainland without malaria, yellow fever, or typhoid fever; diseases like dysentery are medical rarities. Measles and polio, once routine scourges of childhood, were pushed back by millions of vaccinations. Life expectancy increased by more than a decade, to 78 in 2023. This was a public-health revolution, on equal footing with any of the great agricultural, industrial, or information revolutions that have punctuated the past few centuries.

Those other great revolutions are often considered to be the result of technological advances—the plow, steam power, fertilizers, the internet. And certainly, the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and other medicines has played a tremendous role in the advance of human health. But vaccines for smallpox and some other diseases had been around for at least half a century before the 1940s, and had failed to create widespread immunity. The real public-health revolution was first and foremost a change in the way people thought about themselves and their relationship to one another.

Epidemiology made a new kind of thinking necessary. Pathogens respect neither individuals nor borders. Vaccinations and other preventatives against ever-evolving germs do not on their own guarantee personal safety—only eradication can do that. And eradication, it came to be understood, can be achieved only through local and global cooperation.

In America, where capitalist and individualist ethics have always predominated, public health nonetheless managed to carve out a large cooperative space. Before the 1940s, the United States was still reporting a relatively high number of smallpox cases compared with other similarly industrialized nations; it achieved total elimination in 1949. With the insistence of a growing public-health apparatus, it became common practice to wash our hands, to cover our mouths, to not smoke indoors, and to get tested—not just for our own benefit, but for the sake of the people around us. Parents waited in long lines to have their children inoculated, and enterprising physicians went to rural clinics to reach the last isolated clusters of unvaccinated people.

That is not to say America’s particular system of public health was ever perfect. Owing partly to the legacy of segregation, the country never developed a universal health-insurance program, and maintains a fragmented health-care system in which both class and race still dictate much of a patient’s access to care. Many people on the margins who have wanted to get screened for certain diseases or vaccinated against them have not been able to do so, because they cannot afford to or because no doctor will serve them.

And yet, sometimes through the insistence of those same people that America live up to the tenets of public health, the system has come closer to the ideal. As much as any other institution—schools, libraries, churches—the public-health system has helped propagate the idea of a commons, often working against historical inertia to curb the excesses of American individualism. That work has always required energy and effort from the people. And so it has always been vulnerable, because that energy and effort could dissipate at any time.

There is ample evidence that this is exactly what is happening. According to the health-policy organization KFF, in the summer of 2025 just 83 percent of parents kept their children up to date on vaccines, down from 90 percent four years earlier. Cases are surging for several of the diseases covered by the national vaccine schedule. Tuberculosis cases are higher than they have been in a dozen years, and meningococcal disease is rising as well. Measles cases have trended upward for years too, even before 2025.

Over the past 50 years, American trust in the medical system has declined, as has trust in government, science, and expertise in general. The coronavirus pandemic exploded those trends, creating the world in which we now find ourselves. Public-health agencies did themselves no favors: They often gave out confusing and sometimes conflicting advice. Conspiracy theories grew quickly on social media, and measures such as masking became subject to partisan polarization. According to Gallup, a bare majority—just 51 percent—of Americans now favors government requirements for vaccines, down from 81 percent in 1991 and 62 percent in 2019. Most of the slippage has been among conservatives, and studies suggest that political ideology is perhaps the biggest predictor of vaccine rejection.

Medicine has kept moving forward, with some truly great results. Deaths in the U.S. from cardiovascular disease are plummeting, and might see further declines with the advance of GLP‑1 drugs. With the advent of better cancer-screening tools, survival rates are improving, and wonder-drug therapeutics for many conditions are now on the market. But personalized care of this sort is expensive, and does not keep us collectively safe from infectious disease.

Meanwhile, as viruses that once killed hundreds of thousands have receded from public memory, they have come to seem less fearsome. Owing to the near eradication of some diseases, there have been few real risks to the heretofore small portion of people who refuse vaccines. In this landscape, organizations such as the CDC, which once stood as unimpeachable examples of government competence, have become victims of their own success, appearing to skeptics to be inert or irrelevant.

This was the system as Trump and Kennedy found it last year, vulnerable and stripped of the halo of public trust. Kennedy slashed agency budgets and stocked a key vaccine advisory committee with vaccine skeptics, then this past January announced a new set of childhood-vaccine recommendations that excluded coverage for rotavirus, influenza, and hepatitis A, which all now cannot be administered to most patients without a doctor’s consultation.

Kennedy’s biggest threat to public health comes from what he symbolizes. The MAHA movement derides expertise, overemphasizes personal commitment and liberty, and has embraced pseudoscience. This stance, mingled with Trump world’s conspiratorial tendencies, has turned the CDC and other once-trusted institutions into targets. After the August shooting at CDC headquarters, hundreds of current and former Health and Human Services employees singled out Kennedy as a driver of the kind of rhetoric that had motivated Patrick Joseph White, referring to the secretary’s previous insinuations that the CDC itself was hiding information about the risks of COVID vaccines.

Marcus Aurelius, the surviving Roman emperor, is mostly famous in our time because of his Stoicism. His philosophy encouraged the embrace of duty, not because of the expectation of praise or other material benefits but because duty is in itself fulfillment of the human condition. In his Meditations, he offered a maxim: “Do your duty—whether shivering or warm, never mind; heavy-eyed, or with your fill of sleep; in evil report or in good report; dying or with other work in hand.”

It’s hard to psychoanalyze a guy who lived two millennia ago, but it’s easy to believe that this particular admonishment may have come from his time as a plague fighter. In the face of Galen’s “everlasting pestilence,” Marcus had to rally the public and improvise, stocking depleted armies with convicts and ordering the digging of mass graves. He saw that the state was held up not just by the military or territory, but by invisible webs of shared sacrifice and obligation. In the end, the fortifications that mattered most were those that strengthened Rome against the invaders that could not be seen.

If the American state disintegrates, future postmortems are unlikely to focus much on measles, or on rotavirus vaccination rates. But the ability to beat back our more routine pathological menaces is a good indicator of the country’s ability to take on bigger, more virulent threats. The thing about bacteria and viruses, our most ancient foes, is that they are always at the gates, waiting for lean times. Among them will be pathogens worse than the coronavirus.

In the main, the withering of public health might not anticipate a future apocalypse so much as it recalls a previous America, one where lives were cheaper and shorter, where good health was the province of a privileged few, and where epidemics regularly scoured the countryside and the city slums. What’s spurring the slide now isn’t a dearth of information or cutting-edge medicine. Rather, the precepts of a shared reality have been shattered, and with them the ability to act for a common cause.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of the many questions posed by those gathered in U.S. District Judge Richard Leon’s courtroom last week, the most obvious one of all never came up: Why on earth was anyone here in the first place?

Until now, the military has pursued only a tiny number of criminal cases against retirees for actions that occur after military service has ended. Until now, the idea that the secretary of defense would accuse a lawmaker of treason simply for disagreeing with him would be laughable. Until now, any free-speech debates concerning sitting members of Congress have led to the conclusion that lawmakers ought to have—to borrow from former Chief Justice Earl Warren—the widest possible latitude to express themselves.

And yet there we all were anyway, gathered to see Mark Kelly—the fighter pilot turned astronaut turned U.S. senator—defend his First Amendment rights against an attempt by the Pentagon chief, Pete Hegseth, to silence him and knock down his military retirement rank and pay.

As someone who’s covered 10 secretaries of defense, I’ve never seen anything like what Hegseth is doing—not even close. If Hegseth gets his way, he won’t just be punishing Kelly; he will succeed in dramatically curbing the First Amendment rights of all military retirees, some of the very people who have fought to defend such freedoms.

At the heart of the case is a November video in which Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers—all veterans of the military or intelligence agencies—address U.S. troops, reminding them that they “can and must refuse illegal orders.” Their goal with the video was to push back against the president’s domestic troop deployments, a trend his critics feared might lead to clashes with ordinary Americans or be used to interfere in upcoming elections. At the time the video was posted, Democrats were also assailing the administration over the legality of its air campaign against suspected Latin American drug boats. The lawmakers did not specify which problematic orders they had in mind.

The Trump administration’s response was swift. Adviser Stephen Miller called the video an attempted “insurrection.” Donald Trump declared that the “traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” and reposted suggestions that they be hanged. Hegseth ordered the Navy to look into Kelly’s “potentially unlawful” comments, something he was able to do because Kelly is the only one in the video who receives benefits as a military retiree. (Although some 18 million military veterans are living in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, a much smaller share of those people reach retirement status.) Kelly now receives lifelong retirement pay and is subject to rules, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In early January, Hegseth issued Kelly a letter of censure over his “seditious statements and his pattern of reckless misconduct,” which, Hegseth said, had harmed military discipline and undermined the chain of command. He also asked Navy Secretary John Phelan (a Republican donor and billionaire art collector with no naval experience) to begin a review of Kelly’s retirement rank and pay.

The Trump administration’s attempts to go after Kelly are, several legal experts told me, straightforwardly outrageous and without merit. But even if the judge rules in Kelly’s favor, it’s worth paying attention to this fight, because it underscores the degree to which the Trump administration is seeking to expand executive power in novel ways. Far more is at stake than the retirement benefits of one man.

The U.S. military has sought legal action against its own retirees only in a rare few cases—and those cases have typically involved egregious crimes, such as sexual assault. And although the military can prosecute sitting service members for prohibited speech—to make sure troops stay in line and follow orders, the military has strict rules prohibiting them from insulting public officials or making statements that undermine “good order and discipline”—several former military lawyers told me that no cases have previously been brought against a military retiree for something said after they hung up their uniform. “It’s important for the public to understand the extraordinary power that the administration is asking the courts to bless,” Ryan Goodman, a former Pentagon lawyer who teaches at the NYU School of Law, told me.

If the government prevails against Kelly, it will establish a precedent for punishing retirees for statements perceived as out of line by whoever is in charge at the time. (The Trump administration denies that this case has any First Amendment issues to consider, saying that even as a retiree, Kelly has no right to undermine military discipline by encouraging others to question orders.)

Even before the Kelly episode, I had heard from numerous veterans about the chilling effect that Hegseth has had. The defense secretary—who insists on being called the “war secretary”—has used social media and speeches to vilify opponents, including former service members. Those who have worn the uniform are now less likely to criticize the administration’s policy or personnel moves, because they fear for their benefits or worry about getting in hot water with current employers skittish about backlash from the administration.

During his first term, Trump mused about bringing senior officers whom he disliked, including Stanley McChrystal and William McRaven, back onto active duty and court-martialing them, but Pentagon officials talked him out of it, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper wrote in his memoir. Trump once insinuated that retired General Mark Milley, who served as his second chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should be executed. Shortly after taking office, Hegseth stripped Milley of his security detail.

Expanding the military’s ability to control veterans’ speech would be a major and historic reversal of basic freedoms. Retired service members turned public officials have a long history of criticizing Pentagon leaders in ways those leaders might find objectionable. Dwight D. Eisenhower famously warned Americans about the corruption that would come from the unchecked growth of the military-industrial complex, focusing on the power of the people in mitigating “the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power” that would “endanger our liberties or democratic processes.” John F. Kennedy beat back the A bomb–loving generals he believed were as dangerous as Nikita Khrushchev. Veterans have often been some of the harshest (and most clear-eyed) analysts of the military’s shortcomings.

I was thinking about this history as I watched Kelly stand at attention when Judge Leon entered the courtroom on Tuesday, a combat veteran who was doing just as new recruits are taught: holding his spine ramrod straight, fists curled back, thumbs aligned with the seam of the pants.

Leon, who kept his eyebrows positioned in a skeptical V for much of the hearing, seemed to be focused on that history too. How are veterans on Congress’s Armed Services Committees, he asked, supposed to do their job if they can’t criticize the military without fear of prosecution? Leon was visibly wary of the government’s arguments, at times tipping into what appeared to be barely contained bewilderment. At one point, when the Justice Department attorney John Bailey conceded that there were “a few unique things” about the government’s First Amendment–related claims, Leon barked back, “You think?”

Dan Maurer, a former Army lawyer and combat engineer, told me that Hegseth’s decision to pursue administrative disciplinary steps against Kelly—rather than an attempt to court-martial him—was likely because a trial would leave Kelly’s fate to a military jury. When I asked whether such a jury would convict Kelly, he laughed dismissively. “Absolutely not,” he said. Maurer, who teaches law at Ohio Northern University, said he believes that the administration’s objective is more about demonstrating punitive action and appealing to the base than winning in court. “They don’t care what the courts say, because they’re going to depict them as liberal, woke courts,” he said. (Judge Leon was appointed by George W. Bush.)

Tim Parlatore, Hegseth’s personal lawyer who now serves as an adviser in his office, suggested that the Pentagon might not pursue a criminal case against Kelly, because doing so would require him to be called back to active duty in the executive branch. This would effectively remove Kelly from his Senate seat and force litigation. “The Constitution prohibits somebody from holding office in two branches at the same time,” he told the Trump ally and Joseph McCarthy enthusiast Laura Loomer in December.

This brings up a second way that Hegseth’s orders would expand Pentagon leaders’ powers over military retirees. According to Maurer, who signed a letter from a group of retired military lawyers expressing concern about the actions against Kelly, the administrative procedure for reviewing and possibly reducing a retiree’s rank and pay has never been understood to apply to actions that occur after retirement.

Hegseth, who did not attend the hearing, has long expressed his disdain for the military justice system, advocating for lenient treatment of troops convicted of war crimes and deriding judge advocate generals, or JAGs, as pencil-necked “jagoffs.” The Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson said in an emailed statement that can only be interpreted as a non sequitur that Hegseth and his team would “do everything in our power to stop those who seek to harm Americans and the brave men and women defending our Homeland.”

But the government’s lawyer seemed to stumble at times, struggling to defend Hegseth’s actions. Leon noted that the cases the government had cited as precedent weren’t a perfect fit; they were either First Amendment cases involving currently serving troops or cases about other kinds of crimes involving retired military personnel. (Bailey argued that they were relevant because retirees can be recalled to active duty to be court-martialed.) Bailey asserted that retiree speech could still undermine good order and discipline, and denied that Hegseth’s actions would extend the reach of the military’s punitive powers over retirees. (“I know you don’t view it that way, but that’s what you’re doing,” Leon responded.)

Kelly’s attorney, Benjamin Mizer, urged the judge to shut down the Navy’s review because Hegseth’s public statements had put his thumb on the scales. “He’s not a decision maker who has kept an open mind,” Mizer told Leon. Federal courts have had a history of deferring to the military on national-security matters. Leon will issue a decision by Wednesday.

If the government prevails, the silencing of longtime service members would be like barring retired doctors from opining on health policy, Maurer said. When debating matters of war and peace, he said, it serves the public to hear from the very people who have served on the front lines—and lived through the consequences.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/spanish-latino-identity-immigration-trump/685904/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Veronica was born in California into a family with roots in Mexico. She flies the American flag outside her home on national holidays, and proudly belts out “The Star-Spangled Banner” with her hand over her heart at sporting events. Sitting in the bleachers at her son’s baseball game last month, Veronica started chatting with another mom in Spanish. Then she stopped and looked around, wondering if other parents might suspect that the women were undocumented and report them to immigration authorities. Is this going to get me in trouble? she recalled thinking.

Veronica’s concern has only deepened. Two weeks ago, after watching immigration agents arrest and kill U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, she talked with her 14-year-old son about how he should behave if law enforcement asked whether he was in the country legally. If it happened when they were together, she told him, agents would be more likely to focus on her because of her darker complexion. “I’m a U.S. citizen,” she reminded him. “You’re going to see me again.”

Similar conversations are taking place around the country in group chats, classrooms, churches, and at dinner tables among American-born Latinos who feel powerless amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They are scared of being detained or mistakenly deported, and are contending with their identity and place in a country whose highest court has given permission to agents to use a person’s race, ethnicity, or accent as a factor in immigration stops.

About two-thirds of U.S.-born Latinos told the Pew Research Center that they feel their situation has worsened over the past year; nearly half of those queried said they feel less safe in their area because of the mass-deportation blitz. Those I spoke with (all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity or allowed only their first name to be used because they fear retribution) said they are changing their habits. They carry photos of their birth certificate or passport and have saved lawyers’ numbers in their phones. They’re sharing videos of Americans being stopped by authorities and are being tipped off about immigration raids by friends and clients. School administrators are preparing for immigration-enforcement operations at pickup and drop-off. One woman told me that her son came home from school upset because he had a Spanish first name. He asked why he wasn’t given an English-sounding name, like his brother.

Many say they are offended that their legal status, and by extension, their patriotism, could be questioned. Gina Hinojosa, a Democratic state representative from Texas who was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley and is running for governor, said that everywhere she goes, Latino voters tell her they are insulted by the way the mass-deportation blitz has been carried out. “We love our country; we feel just as American as anyone, because we are,” she told me. “To be treated as not American enough, not Texan enough, is just a slap in the face.”

In Phoenix, where I live and where 42 percent of the population identifies as Latino, people have distinct memories of the last time immigration-enforcement operations were carried out this aggressively. Then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio had his deputies flood heavily Latino neighborhoods about 18 years ago, stopping and detaining people suspected of being in the country illegally. The sweeps, followed by a 2010 state law that was intended to crack down on undocumented immigrants, caused pervasive fear, not just among people who were in the country unlawfully.

The Trump administration’s mass-deportation campaign has now put much of the sprawling metropolis on edge, including residents who are American citizens. When an entourage of ICE vehicles was spotted at a park where youth-sports practices take place, word quickly spread on a neighborhood social-media page and in family texts: Stay away from the park. One 27-year-old who works in financial services told me he changed the route he drives to work to avoid ICE-marked SUVs. A small-business owner worries that her citizenship might be stripped because her mother came to the U.S. unlawfully. One prominent local restaurateur, whose family’s history in this country spans generations, told me he now lives with an undercurrent of anxiety, especially when his family travels through places that might have immigration checkpoints or when he gets close to the U.S.-Mexico border. “I’m the darkest one in my family,” he said. “I always turn down the music, I’m always very serious when we cross borders.” His wife and children have made fun of him. “You guys don’t understand,” he told them.

Students are particularly affected, their parents and educators told me; some have asked whether college scholarships could be rescinded because of their ethnicity, and some now prefer remote learning because of the possibility of raids. Robert is a dark-skinned 17-year-old who plays soccer, is learning Spanish, and gets good grades. His great-great-great-grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico in the late 1890s; Robert was born in Arizona. But he told me he’s started thinking that other people don’t believe he belongs in the U.S. He hears the demeaning words some classmates use when talking about politics, and said he often feels hostility from others because of the color of his skin.

He recently dug up a picture of his passport to have at the ready in case authorities demand to know where he was born. His parents warned him to stay under the speed limit to avoid drawing attention from police. Robert said he has drifted away from friends who have said they support Trump’s immigration policies.

“All of this stuff brought me to the question of: Am I proud to be an American?” he said. If he were to leave the U.S., he wondered, where would he go? “Do I want to be called an American? Is that a source of pride or is that a source of shame?” He isn’t sure.

A man who served in the military, and whose 26-year-old daughter, born in Germany, has dual citizenship, told me she recently asked whether she could be deported. Although his family has been in the U.S. for more than 100 years, he didn’t know what to say. “They’re doing lots of crazy stuff,” he told her. “I don’t know what could happen.” She asked him for help getting a U.S. passport, and he agreed. Before hanging up the phone, he told his daughter that he should be her first call if she ever ran into trouble with immigration authorities.

Stoking helplessness and fear may be part of the point of Trump’s crackdowns and rhetoric, experts who study cultural identity and politics told me. The administration’s tactics send a message about who belongs in the country, “who is morally worthy, and who is not,” Tomás R. Jiménez, a sociology professor at Stanford University, told me.

The alienation that message creates—particularly in combination with extreme partisanship—has the potential to reshape the way Americans interact with their neighbors, schools, employers, churches, and democratic institutions. Politically, it could threaten gains made by Trump and the Republican Party among Latino voters, who helped return him to the White House. Latino voters—like most people—want to feel like they are getting ahead economically, but recent polling shows that they feel like Trump and Republicans haven’t kept their promises to lower prices. In a special election in Texas this month, a Democrat won a state-Senate seat in a deep-red district that Trump won by 17 points in 2024, a shift powered by Latino voters turned off by Trump’s immigration operations and their economic situations. Even when Arizona was reliably red, it placed limits on hard-line immigration enforcement. Arpaio’s efforts in the early 2000s, followed by the state law, activated a generation of young Latinos who helped oust Arpaio in 2016, even as Trump won Arizona.

Electoral defeat could await Republicans who don’t distance themselves from Trump’s immigration raids, Richard Herrera, a professor emeritus of political science at Arizona State University, told me. “When people feel betrayed or feel abandoned,” he said, “they’re more likely to look for alternatives.”

The many people I spoke with told me the scenes from Minneapolis have made them feel more civically connected, because their rightful place in their country is at stake. After a popular chain of restaurants in Maricopa County was raided by immigration agents late last month, the teenagers of several parents I spoke with joined thousands of other high schoolers in and around Phoenix to march out of school. They will soon be old enough to vote. Among them was Veronica’s son.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show/685929/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the days and weeks leading up to Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show, a nervous kind of hype swept America. The 31-year-old artist is, by some measures, the most popular working musician in the world. But because he almost exclusively performs in Spanish and has spoken up against ICE, right-wing commentators suggested he was too political for the time slot, while branding him with various scary synonyms like “provocative” and “divisive.” Just a few hours before the show, the influencer Jake Paul called him “a fake American citizen performing who publicly hates America.”

During his performance on Sunday night, Bad Bunny had an answer for that last one: “God bless America,” he announced. But his entire performance rebuked the notion that he is some culture-war proxy being foisted upon an American public that wants its stars to shut up and sing. Yes, he filled this show with slogans and symbols signaling Puerto Rican and Latino pride at a time when federal agents are menacing Spanish speakers and President Trump has declared English to be the national language. But fundamentally, the halftime was a blast: an instant-classic, precisely detailed, relentlessly stimulating medley rooted in the good old-fashioned pleasure principle.

Bad Bunny opened in what looked like sugarcane fields worked by dancers dressed in the straw hats of jíbaros (Puerto Rico’s rural farmers). Against this pastoral backdrop, Bad Bunny stood looking modern and fly, in a boxy white shirt patterned like an NFL jersey. He was rapping in Spanish to his smash “Tití Me Preguntó,” but the pigskin he held in his hand and the tie around his neck conveyed a clear message to any viewer. He was here for business. He was here to play ball.

Play he did. As he walked through the tropical hedge maze, he passed by whimsical set pieces including a coconut vendor, a dominoes match, and a construction site manned by—how to put this respectfully—hot girls. This was the first of many awooga visuals to come—mass twerking, a fleeting shot of guy-on-guy grinding, and Bad Bunny executing his trademark crotch thrust. If any of this inspires scandal, it’ll be the healthy kind, giving America a break from fascism discourse to rehash now-quaint-seeming dustups caused by the likes of Elvis, Janet Jackson, and Prince (the originator of what’s becoming a hallowed tradition of Super Bowl halftime crotch-troversies).

Really, what does it say about the state of the nation that the sight of good-looking people doing slinky choreography feels … refreshing? It’s not like the much-publicized conservative cultural wave of the 2020s has rolled back pop culture’s reliance on raunch. But this performance’s wealth of gyration seemed subtly throwback-y and weirdly wholesome. Maybe that was because the smiles on everyone’s faces conveyed sexiness without porniness. The dancing and costumes took me back to being a young teen watching the airbrushed sultriness of early-2000s MTV and being intrigued by the world that allegedly existed somewhere outside my home.

Bad Bunny was indeed trying to take viewers out of their home, and into his. The sheer volume of references to Puerto Rico defied any notion that the island is a minor player in American culture; rather, we were reminded that it’s a powerhouse domestic and global exporter. Puerto Rico gave us the archetypal reggaeton hit, Daddy Yankee’s “Gasolina,” which popped up for a few moments tonight. Its musicians helped invent salsa music—which provided much-needed syncopation when Lady Gaga appeared to sing her normally plodding hit “Die With a Smile.” It gave us the square jaw and honeyed voice of Ricky Martin, who sang as well. And it gave us the night’s headliner, who nodded at the significance of his own success when he handed a Grammy to a boy who looked like he might grow up to one day be, well, Bad Bunny.

Eventually, the energy of the performance shifted from party to statement piece—yet smart stagecraft made that shift feel climactic rather than deflating. Exploding power lines evoked the electrical outages that have plagued Puerto Rico in recent years. For most of the show, Bad Bunny had been mugging merrily to the camera, flaring his eyes and making hammy gestures to illustrate his words. But now anger seemed to twitch in his face as he rapped his song “El Apagón” (“The Power Outage”). Through affect alone, he got across a sense of betrayal that many Puerto Ricans of his age—commonly called the “crisis generation”—have spoken of feeling after a string of political scandals and natural disasters amid ongoing gentrification by mainlanders.

That message was, indeed, political. So was his culminating statement of “God bless America,” which he followed by listing countries in North and South America, thereby asserting the transnational nature of the culture that he represents. Pushing toward the camera with throngs of drummers, he closed by holding up a football with a message on it: Together, We Are America. It was a pointed message but also a conciliatory one, a unity slogan. Some people were going to look for a fight anyway. &quot;Nobody understands a word this guy is saying,” complained Trump on Truth Social, minutes after the performance, “and the dancing is disgusting.”</div>

            <h2>‘The Trust Has Been Absolutely Destroyed’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/trump-gabbard-election-investigations-states/685922/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The email that federal law enforcement sent this week to the nation’s top election administrators would have been routine just a few years ago. “Your election partners,” the Tuesday missive from FBI Election Executive Kellie Hardiman read, “would like to invite you to a call where we can discuss preparations for the cycle.”

But multiple secretaries of state who received the document told us they viewed it as a threat, given recent events. The FBI had just seized 2020 election materials in Georgia, and President Trump had announced his desire to “nationalize” elections, a state responsibility under the U.S. Constitution. The Department of Justice has sued more than 20 states to obtain their election rolls, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is conducting an investigation of U.S. voting technology. The upshot is that a yearslong partnership between state and federal authorities—in which the feds have provided assistance on election security and protected state and local voting systems from threats—is now in danger of falling apart. Instead of “partners,” some state authorities now view federal officials involved in election efforts with deep suspicion.

“The trust,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told us, “has been absolutely destroyed.” The sentiment is not confined to Democrats. Some state-level Republican election officials, who, like others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity to speak freely, said that federal officials’ activities involving elections have become so unusual that they are starting to question the federal officials’ competency and motives. These state officials wonder whether the feds are trying to do what Trump has accused others of doing: rig an election.

With just more than eight months before midterm elections, Trump has already said that he will accept the results only “if the elections are honest,” and has mused that “we shouldn’t even have an election” given that the midterms typically result in defeats for the president’s party. He has called for the greater use of identification at all polling places, a ban on mail voting, and a prohibition on certain types of voting equipment. Inside the White House, his obsession with disproving the results of the 2020 election, which he lost, has led to the creation of a standing working group that meets regularly to coordinate federal efforts to investigate past elections and reform future election processes.

The result is a breakdown in the state and federal partnership that has long facilitated the nation’s elections. After a White House official, Jared Borg, told secretaries of state to expect a Cabinet-level briefing at a conference in Washington last month, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard failed to appear, according to Lawrence Norden, the vice president for elections and government at the Brennan Center for Justice, who attended the briefing. Days later, the election leaders received the email from Hardiman, a career official, who had appeared at the conference to discuss the more traditional roles the FBI plays in assisting election administrators, including investigations of threats to state and local election officials.

“It was very standard FBI stuff about their role in elections,” Norden told us. “In another time, this would not have raised any eyebrows.”

But Trump’s demands that his law-enforcement agencies chase election conspiracies could animate attempts to contest the 2026 election results should Democrats take control of the House, Senate, or both, election officials and experts said. The images of federal authorities seizing ballots in Georgia could reinforce the president’s false claims of widespread voter fraud and deepen suspicion about the legitimacy of elections. Experts say there is little indication that federal courts will allow Trump to dictate to states the methods or administration of elections. But officials are preparing for legal battles in the coming months, and say the courts will need to hold the line on federal interference.

“It’s kind of like Donald Trump saying to the prime minister of Greenland, ‘I’m your partner,’” the Democratic election attorney Marc Elias told us. “Saying this has been done in the past is cold comfort when Donald Trump is saying, in the Oval Office, that states are his vassals.”

Trump won reelection in 2024 without ever conceding his defeat in 2020. From the start of his second term, his senior team launched tandem efforts to rectify the imagined injustice of a rigged vote. The first focused on executive actions and legislative efforts to change the way elections are conducted in the future, a project that has so far yielded little progress. Federal judges have rejected Trump’s demands that states impose new identification rules and threats to withhold federal funding to states that don’t change their voting systems or voter-registration forms.

The second effort, which has begun to come to light in recent weeks, focused on using federal investigative power to find evidence that would confirm Trump’s belief about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. These investigations began as largely exploratory projects, seeking evidence to confirm what the president and some of his advisers have long believed about the possibility of past fraud. Many state governments have resisted efforts by the Department of Justice to obtain raw voting records, although some have cooperated.

One DOJ official characterized the seizure in Fulton County as a recalibration in strategy that resulted from the president’s frustration. “The White House has tried to get these ballots from day one,” this person said, referring to voting records in Georgia and other states that Trump lost in 2020.

Trump immediately offered support for the operation, and even got on the phone with FBI agents in Atlanta and with Gabbard to thank them for their efforts. “Now they’re going to find out the true winner of that state,” Trump said this week about the search, before making clear that there was only one right answer. “If there was cheating, which there was, but if there was cheating, it should be found, because we can’t let it happen again.”

Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said in a letter to Congress that Trump did not ask questions during the phone call and she and the president did not issue directives to FBI agents. She has launched a separate investigation of election-infrastructure vulnerabilities, which involved collecting voting equipment from Puerto Rico. Intelligence officials typically keep their distance from domestic law-enforcement matters. But in a February 2 letter to Congress, Gabbard said her work was being conducted under her statutory authority to “analyze intelligence related to election security, including counter-intelligence, foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity.” Gabbard attended the seizure in Fulton County, she said, at the request of Trump.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche both praised and appeared to try to minimize Gabbard’s role in recent public appearances. He told Fox News on Monday that “first of all, she wasn’t at the search; she was in the area where the search took place. She’s not part of this investigation.” He said on January 30 that Gabbard’s presence in Atlanta “shouldn’t be questioned.” But those close to the White House reluctantly acknowledge that she has managed to deliver—or create the perception that she has delivered—what the president wants. “Gabbard is the only one who has actually pulled it off,” one official said. While speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump congratulated Gabbard on her performance.

The involvement of the intelligence community reflects the president’s frustration with senior Justice Department officials and others he perceives as obstructing his agenda or being insufficiently loyal. “Justice has just sat on things for months,” an official told us. “It boggles the mind that they wouldn’t just take the ballots!” The official insisted that Trump “should have gotten them on the first day of his term.” This person said the president and his allies have concluded that “if there was a true Trump prosecutor, it would have already been done.”

One indication of the push for more deferential leadership at the DOJ is the elevation of the Missouri prosecutor Thomas Albus to oversee election investigations nationwide. Albus and his team have quietly conducted interviews, collected tens of thousands of pages of documents, and carried out other efforts in multiple states in recent months, according to  people familiar with the probes.

Albus has a pedigree as a longtime member of what has been referred to as the “Missouri conservative movement”—a group of current and former senior Republicans who have used the state’s power and resources to try to overturn the 2020 election. The group includes Ed Martin—the DOJ’s pardon attorney and the former head of its “Weaponization Working Group’’—as well as Senator Eric Schmitt, who led a group of Republican attorneys general in litigation efforts focused on the 2020 vote. Albus, who declined to comment for this story, is seen as more “reliable” than others at the DOJ by people close to the president, one person told us. The DOJ declined to comment.

Gabbard has led a separate effort involving personnel from numerous law-enforcement agencies, including the DOJ and the FBI, to arrange the “voluntary turnover” of electronic voting machines from Puerto Rico to her department. An ODNI spokesperson said that the agency “found extremely concerning cyber-security and operational deployment practices that pose a significant risk to U.S. elections” from the materials taken from Puerto Rico. A person briefed on the operation said the focus was on machines used in the 2020 election. A spokesperson for the ODNI said that the actions were not about any specific election. The efforts were “about assessing for vulnerabilities” in voting systems to help improve security for all elections, this person said.

So far, Gabbard and the ODNI have stopped short of alleging they have found evidence of foreign interference in prior elections. Some current and former officials believe that her efforts are intended to introduce enough doubt to lay the foundation for future fraud claims, or possibly provide a basis for the federal government to take over election administration in certain places. The location and chain of custody of the seized voting materials from Fulton are tightly guarded secrets. Officials at the DOJ and the ODNI will not say where federal authorities took the materials, or if they even remain in Georgia. Fulton officials have gone to court to try to reclaim the materials, arguing that the federal government is violating rules intended to ensure the integrity of ballots and a clear chain of custody. “Fulton County can no longer be held responsible for what happens to any items contained in those boxes that relate to the 2020 election,” Robb Pitts, the chair of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, told us. “I don&#39;t know who has those 700 boxes now, nor do I know what they’re doing with them.”

Some election administrators fear that the efforts will erode public confidence in elections and could create a legal predicate for more aggressive moves by Trump later this year. Cleta Mitchell, a Republican activist who has advised Trump in the past, has argued that a federal election takeover would be possible after the president declares a national emergency based on a threat to the “sovereignty” of the country. Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump, has been rallying the president’s supporters to demand military deployments to polling places this fall.  “You have got to call up the 82nd and the 101st Airborne on the Insurrection Act. You’ve got to get around every poll,” Bannon said this week on his online show, War Room. “We will not accept anything less.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt distanced the president from Bannon’s comments this week, saying the administration had no plans to send immigration enforcement to polling places. Inside the West Wing, top advisers to the president have also resisted any plans for a “nationalization” of voting processes, despite Trump’s suggestion that the federal government could “take over the voting” in “15 places.” His focus, his advisers say, is on legislative changes to voting procedures, reforms that are permitted by the Constitution but face Democratic resistance in the Senate.

“President Trump pledged to secure America’s elections, and he has tasked the most talented team of patriots to do just that,” the White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told us in a statement. “The President’s team, including DNI Gabbard and FBI Director Patel, are working together to implement the President’s election integrity priorities, and their work continues to serve him and the entire country well.”

On Thursday, Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told reporters that “it appears there may be a coordinated effort to try to interfere in the ’26 midterms. They may even start to interfere in, prior to, in the primaries, or in a state like mine, where they may have—we may have—a statewide referendum on redistricting.” The ODNI declined to respond.

At a minimum, elections officials face the renewed burden of defending the credibility of voting systems that have repeatedly proved themselves in recent years. Some Republican campaign consultants have warned that the effort could backfire on their own midterm efforts by decreasing turnout among the president’s base and increasing turnout among Democrats.

“There is certainly going to be an influence campaign to undermine confidence in the election,” Norden, of the Brennan Center, told us. “Those are the things that we need to be preparing for.”

Elections officials told us they are now getting ready for interference from both foreign adversaries and the White House. Several said they are still deliberating whether to show up to the FBI-hosted meeting scheduled for February 25. Others said they will attend but not speak out of concern that their information could be turned against them. The FBI declined to make its election executive available for an interview and noted to us that the invitation to meet with Hardiman and other federal officials is not out of the ordinary.

State officials are readying for intense scrutiny by federal authorities. Authorities in one state told us they have retained outside legal counsel in case federal officials seek 2020-related materials, and are drafting legislation to try to make it harder for the U.S. government to do so. Georgia election officials told us they have been working overtime to consult with criminal attorneys. Some Republican election chiefs said they were trying to avoid engaging with federal officials at all, and some said their trust with federal officials was situational.

In Maricopa County, Arizona, anxieties are so high that county officials are contacting employees who worked on the 2024 presidential election—which Trump won—to determine whether they have records on their private electronic devices that should be preserved to comply with a DOJ litigation hold they received last year, three people told us. The county’s request to employees came amid fears that county officials—who weathered years of violent threats and harassment after Trump’s 2020 loss—could be accused by federal prosecutors of obstruction of justice.</div>

Turn it into an app that includes social networking. Maybe that&#39;ll get them to read the documentation.

Once you leave it won&#39;t be your problem if management have been short sighted with the training and the company tanks. Most people don&#39;t stay at companies more than a few years now anyway as its been demonstrated many times in the last decade or so that people are norhing more than &quot;resources&quot; like paperclips to most companies, to be disposed off when profits dip.

I am at the point I&#39;m about to retire. At work, I keep having to remind people of this. I&#39;m the one who has built up the knowledge base, and everyone comes to when they need something. I understand how all the parts work together, while most are focused on the piece they work on. I am constantly reminding upper management that I need to train people. People keep coming and going, learn then leave. And no one reads documentation, so that&#39;s not an option. They&#39;re all good people, and I&#39;m sure they will handle it when I&#39;m gone. We are constantly working on modernizing, which is great! Just need to make sure that they don&#39;t forget important parts.

Start now and incorporate yourself. LLC or as I prefer a S-Corp.

Then when you retire, and they inevitably get lost and try to contact you...be ready to consult back to them 1099 at a few hundred dollars and hour bill rate.

This way, you&#39;ll get some good pocket money, they won&#39;t go down the drain AND if the bill rate is high enough they won&#39;t bother you for piddly shit....

Fuck it, retire. No longer you problem if the company folds due to mismanagement.

They don&#39;t *need* to justify it. They just do it, probably mostly reflexively now. It&#39;s not like they are going to get sued because they would never say &quot;age&quot; is the reason they aren&#39;t hiring someone.

3) Older people make younger people more cynical, faster.They put up with no shit, call bullshit bullshit in public and don&#39;t kowtow to stupidity. This does not sit well many managers.

My observation is that the population groups are different between young and old workers.

It&#39;s not that individual older workers are more productive in any way, but rather that the young cohort contains all the people who will become drunks, drug users, who bring their sex problems to works, who steal and so on.The young people who are not fucked up are often amazing, but the worthless ones cause more problems and bring others down, so on the average productivity is damaged.The worthless old ones who have jo

We&#39;ve seen and heard all the BS and veiled threats from various pointy hairs over the decades and its water off a ducks back. They can&#39;t handle that, particularly if they&#39;re young with large egos.

            <div id="article-text">They say no performance impact, presumably meaning compute performance. But what about power efficiency performance?

It&#39;s LPDDR4 RAM. Having a second chip is insignificant, an entire SODIMM typically uses 300mW of power and usually has 8 of these things on them.

Recycling was a lot easier when RAM was on SIMMs and DIMMS (and socketed DIPs for the old-timers).

Unlikely that it would be compatible. You would need a reflow oven and xray machine at the minimum.

I wonder if anyone made a magnetic core memory module for the Pi? Core memory [core64.io] for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Core memory [core64.io] for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Get an Orange Pi, for example. Designed by people with some actual understanding of hardware, not the clowns that designed the RP. Typically cheaper, more options, etc.

The Pi folks fuck up bigly on approximately every design. I&#39;ve been watching casually since I had the raspi model A with the shitfest USB that all the fanboy clowns defended to the death even though it made the device completely worthless for any USB traffic heavy applications. They especially half-ass the power supply section of the board almost every time, which is very very bad since if that doesn&#39;t work right, nothing else does either.

And yet the RPi still sell very well after all these years...

The purpose of the RPi was not to build pocketable super computers, it was to introduce a new generation of students to a computing experience akin to the late 70s and 80s, Apple, Tandy, Commodore, etc, as well as encourage harware mods like leds, relays, and sensors.

The original designs were based on cellphone chips, which oddly lacked things like Ethernet, so yes, early designs were not optimal, but they were functional.

Bingo. It was a product designed to be made as cheaply as possible.

And yet the RPi still sell very well after all these years...Consumer ignorance is always a good bet.

And yet the RPi still sell very well after all these years...

There&#39;s a ton of value in broad availability of supply, huge support and peripheral ecosystem and so on.

If I need to squeeze performance on a budget, then sure. But for many cases the RasPi is fine, and the time spent not faffing around with niche hardware greatly outweighs the few tens of dollars of extra cost for the Pi.

There&#39;s a ton of value in broad availability of supply, huge support and peripheral ecosystem and so on.I suppose it depends what you&#39;re going to do with it.  If you&#39;re going to make and market an industrial controller, or a networked bathroom snitch puck, and require (moderately) guaranteed-stable-and-available hardware that you can vibe code in Python, Pi is a good solution.  If you&#39;ve got children and want to teach them about computers from YouTube videos but miss out all the fun parts of actually understanding how they work and how to fix them when they don&#39;t, Pi is the answer.If you&#39;re doing DIY stuff an

I should follow this up with the addendum that the RPi folks hit it out of the park with the Pi Pico.

Custom silicon rather than taking a shitty SOC and drawing a smiley face on it, features no one else has (mainly the PIO blocks), and a price point so good that no one&#39;s really going to bother knocking it off (there are clone boards, but they all seem to use the RP chip).

Different market, but a full embrace of the DIY maker ethos that RPi started with.

&quot;Better&quot; requires you to define your requirements. All Orange Pi models come at a considerable price disadvantage compared to RPis. So already it is a failure for the requirements of many people, those who already consider the RPi 4 to be too expensive.

Please stop suggesting solutions to people without even asking what the problem is.

As to your complaints, there&#39;s been one major screwup and that was the power design on the original Pi. Everything else is a tradeoff. The original RPi had a perfectly find USB

Get an Orange Pi, for example. Designed by people with some actual understanding of hardware, not the clowns that designed the RP. Typically cheaper, more options, etc.And BetaMax had superior video quality.  And yet, people ended up at VHS because technical quality is not always the sole determining factor of who wins. 

Also: do you think OrangePi is immune to the current RAM sourcing problems?

Musk has no clue and he is not an engineer. Even only keeping out the Regolith dust (which will be survival critical) will take longer to figure out than those &quot;10 years&quot;.

Nobody thinks he&#39;s doing all the work.But we all see he&#39;s constantly making up bullshit without verifying it the people that are supposed to implement it because he&#39;s perpetually desperate for attention, and needs to keep promising new bullshit to keep the stock prices high.

We&#39;ve all got first-hand knowledge of that because he keeps saying and doing things in public that confirm it. We don&#39;t need to have direct access to someone&#39;s inner mind to make reasonable inferences about their motivations. It&#39;s a completely normal thing to do, and you do it all the time, because humans can&#39;t function without it.

Indeed. And maybe the engineers will come up with a breakthrough in some area of tech but if not - well its keeping a lot of highly educated people gainfully employed and if Musk wants to spend his - or more likely some gullible investors - money on their wages then he should be allowed to carry on doing it.

Musk has been making bad predictions for decades now. Boots on Mars in 10 years, about 15 years ago now. Full self driving in 6 months, a decade ago. Starship was supposed to be flying regular missions by now, the new Roadster should have been delivered years ago (with booster rockets, according to Elon).

And the new roadster is hardly pushing the engineering boat out either in 2026 , its easily doable with current tech as other companies are proving, so one can only assume he&#39;s lost interest in it.

There&#39;s a huge difference between NASA making plans that encounter delays, and Elon pulling dates out of his ass.

He just seems to consistently and vastly underestimate the difficulty of engineering these things. He seems to have thought that Starship was just a case of making a bigger rocket, a few years tops, and then unlimited tankers to orbit so Mars is &quot;easy&quot;.

AI is another massive blind spot for him. The original 6 months for full self driving seems to have been based on a misunderstanding of how AI works and how difficult image recognition it. Many of the fatalities caused by Tesla Autopilot are due to it simply

Um... I have issues with a lot that Elon says, but those are some pretty weak arguments.

Yes, we can, with today&#39;s tech, get people to Mars and back without them dying of radiation poisoning.  Not significantly increasing their lifetime risk of cancer is the challenge, not the question of whether you can keep them alive.  And the solutions aren&#39;t at all magical - you coast with your fuel and engines between your crew and the sun, and you ideally also have small shelters for solar storms. GCR can&#39;t be readily

In November he updated the rocket roadster to a flying roadster that we would see demoed by the end of the year. That created a distraction for a few weeks.

I read a few accounts of this meeting to get a good picture of what happened and it is a whole lot of nothing. Musk was just gassing to investors in a meeting with his trademark vague &quot;visionary&quot; BS.

Rest assured, he will bring Mars up again in the not too distant future when he needs another distraction.

This speaks volumes about Musk&#39;s predictions. He said they were going to skip the moon to go to Mars, as all that &#39;research&#39; on the moon was pointless, and he wanted to &#39;back up&#39; the human race on Mars.

Now he says they&#39;re going to the moon instead. He also claims it&#39;ll take less than 10 years.

I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll need someone up there to swap power supplies and check coolant systems. Surely he wants to put his fat-ass where his money goes.

It is a done deal, basically, with blackjack and hookers.As a matter of fact, forget the whole moon thing.

Nope. It gives you some hard surfaces, but the fine dust will still get everywhere and slowly kill people.

Aw, come on. Just wash it down with some water, same as nuclear safety decontamination procedures. It&#39;s a long-solved problem.

Correct me if I am wrong, but don&#39;t microwaves heat things by exciting water? Does microwave radiation work on dry sand/dust?

Microwaves work on metal, too, or you wouldn&#39;t bet getting those sparks in a microwave, nor could you melt tin like some people do.

I&#39;m sure that powerful enough microwaves will interact with anything their wave can disturb and not go right through.

But you are right that rocks or lunar regolith are not things that microwaves work well on.

It took him longer than ten years to figure out human flight to ISS.

I know you&#39;re going to be a trillionaire soon, but damn. Your projections started out grandiose, but now they&#39;re just humorous. You blew past unreasonable so quickly we didn&#39;t even notice it.

It wouldn&#39;t work for &quot;securing the future of civilization,&quot; even if they were able to overcome the mountain of difficult and expensive engineering challenges.

Any sort of calamity that put human life on Earth in peril would mean the lunar colony would stop receiving support from Earth and would die off long before the last holdouts Earthside.

There&#39;s an incredibly long list of things they&#39;d need shipped up to survive, none of which are needed on Earth. Because on Earth you can survive by primitive means if necessary.

This isn&#39;t &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.  It is hard to make a moon colony self-sustaining.  Just the loss of core materials due to daily use have to be replenished from Earth, otherwise the colony will eventually become a tomb.

At the minimum, it will take multiple, redundant sources of iron and other materials, a source of oxygen, water (which means hydrogen, and there isn&#39;t much of that in the moon&#39;s atmosphere.)

It isn&#39;t just an engineering hurdle.  This is a resource hurdle and providing things that are already hard to get on earth, and already need extremely modern supply lines to make and get into a usable thing in the first place.

Instead, the best hope is trying to get mines up and go 100% robotic until we can get stuff piled in areas that are usable.  This combined with a cheaper propellant source because moving stuff out of Earth&#39;s gravity well isn&#39;t cheap.

A very fancy, very rich one, but a marketdroid with money to spend nonetheless. His skills are in bullshitting about maybes, pure and simple. Sometimes he gets it right with EVs and rockets, sometimes when he attempts to be a futurologist without understanding the engineering and biological issues he just sounds like an idiot. This is one of those times.

i always remember the impression he made on me when i first watched a Tesla keynote he did, years and years ago. I remember thinking to myself &quot;how can he be so shit at this compared to Jobs?&quot; I know Steve Jobs was a phenomenal presenter, but Musk was just such a *shit* presenter. I couldn&#39;t believe that other people thought he was good at it.

It will be built with fully autonomous self driving cars, but only with an upfront payment of 3Bn dollars.

It took him a while, but he finally seems to have found a sea [wikipedia.org] that is &quot;not too choppy&quot; [x.com] for a Cybertruck to drive across.

I remember the document &quot;Affordable, rapid bootstrapping of space industry and solarsystem civilization&quot;

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.032... [arxiv.org]

A decade ago it was proposed about develop the Moon with the assistance of AI. It&#39;s not about human colonization. Not yet. And more about robot colonization.

I think it&#39;s a great idea. Low risk (human missions are a lot more expensive), finally develop local resources, with a fixed cost per time, develop an exponential infrastructure.

The thing is, this proposition was developed before AI revolution, so I think now has more sense than ever.

Once you industrialize the Moon, create an true near self-sustaining, redundant and growing outpost become a lot more easier and logical.

Don&#39;t start with human colonization. Let&#39;s focus on robot colonization (instead of exploration) now.And the Moon has lots of advantages in that regard. Relatively &quot;high&quot; gravity (in comparison with most rock bodies of the Solar System). Nearly real-time communication (just a pair of seconds apart). Some good metal reserves. Spots with near 24x7 light (in the poles, a bunch of solar groups of interconnected panels can reach that goal). Some ice to build fuel. A potential space elevator.

Not ideal for human colonization, but great for robot colonization, and we probably should start that way.Manned program requires elevate the security and will raise the cost too much.

Then there&#39;s the Kessler syndrome. Thanks to Elon and his ilk, we are well on our way to filling up an unregulated layer of space junk at the low earth orbital regions of space. When critical mas

Exactly. Buying Twitter was a financial disaster. His solution was to form xAI and use that money to buy Twitter and make the private investors &quot;whole&quot; so thry are happy. Now they are racing to cash out xAI investors before the bubble pops, so SpaceX &quot;buys&quot; it. SpaceX goes public, VCs make their big multiple, and then Musk fans just keep believing the hype. There is a famous saying that is the gist of Elon: &quot;the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent&quot;. Betting on Elon is a proxy for bet

Self sustaining space colonies are the only way to escape earth&#39;s politics, and most importantly, the pull on the soul of the gravity.Also &quot;musk&quot; is a pretty dumb surname, i consider changing to something more nice, more space like, like &quot;Deikum&quot;

Also not related at all, but if you ever think on doing giant robots, consider only using only one big red eye, and giving em axes that heat up the edge. it will tell earth everything they need to know.

Every month the plot becomes more and more believe able.

I agree, Rugby took it seriously, conducted research made changes,  Player are taken off the field and giving medical checks for suspected concussion, tackles that were standard are now banned,

The NFL&#39;s we&#39;ll just ignore it and keep making money attitude has been disgraceful.  The research from Rugby found that helmets make things worse because players see it as protection from concussions and do harder tackles.

Player are taken off the field and giving medical checks for suspected concussion, tackles that were standard are now banned,

The NFL&#39;s we&#39;ll just ignore it

The NFL has mandatory injury checks (including for concussion) and banned dangerous types of tackles also.

Came here to say pretty much the same thing.  They want to make billions of dollars from having 300+ lb men not only crashing into each other but learning to crash into each other the HARDEST!  How cute that they try to pretend they care about the health of those men.

The NFL has been pretending to care about concussions more or less as long as I can remember; and I&#39;m north of 40 at this point.

They should introduce speed limits of about 3mph. And switch from helmets to bowler hats.What you need are stovepipe hats and pipes... at least that will give them something to do whilst the game constantly stops, those that don&#39;t smoke can point their pipes at the umpire and say &quot;and another thing, sir&quot;. 

Or just start playing Aussie Rules Football without helmets and armour.

There&#39;s only so much you can do with helmets to make the game safer. Per TFS, I do see an opportunity with facemasks, if they can be made more shock-absorbing. But I wonder if such changes would just encourage more aggressive contact that nullifies the advantage. Rule-changes might be needed to keep that from happening.

Last year I remember watching the Grey Cup (the equivalent of the SuperBowl for Canadian football) and seeing several players wearing an additional padded cover over their helmets. It looked

If I remember history of this one correctly, American Football didn&#39;t originally have the current head banging style of play, because helmets were initially not used at all, and when they came, they were primitive.

As protective gear got better, it led to goal oriented to athletes aimed at winning to play in ways that new protective gear enables them to play. I.e. better helmets = more banging heads together.

The one thing that will work is rule change. But rule changes always carry a risk of losing a lot of

There are lots of games that use an oval ball and don&#39;t wear helmets. All of those have made major moves over the last decades to reduce the likelihood of concussions by making certain moves illegal in the game, with significant penalties. Spear tackles, grabbing around the neck, dumping people head first, slamming the back of the head into the turf, etc.

So why doesn&#39;t American football do the same? Penalties can be percentage of salary, reduction of team salary caps, etc to take into account the ridiculous money involved esp. with some players.

If you want to reduce concussions, eliminate helmets. All that has been accomplished with helmet improvements is players use their heads increasingly as battering rams.

Reminds me of something I&#39;ve read: boxing with gloves is massively more dangerous than bare-knuckle boxing. Normally, punching someone&#39;s face with full power will also wreck your hand. Gloves remove this drawback, and thus lead to many more cases of severe brain damage.

In their video most the fouls are double fouls ... the rule is a lame duck.

That&#39;s the NFL&#39;s solution to everything: make a rule that is complicated, ambiguous, and unenforceable. Predictably, that kind of rule never fixes the problem.

Alternatively, make them active. Collapsible airpockets allow more distance for deceleration than any type of reusable foam too, but can reinflate after impact.

This isn&#39;t about the ethnicity, it&#39;s about geopolitics and the different goals of our government and theirs.  That said, I question the value of that when half our electronics are manufactured there and can have hardware level spying already there.

PRC has significantly tighter rules on cars being sold into their massive market that this.

You can&#39;t even do it. Until very recently, you had to partner with a local and give them access to your technology. Which meant local just put up a second factory with their copy of your tech next door.

Does that mean PRC can&#39;t compete or is there perhaps another reason?

You contradict yourself, but you don&#39;t even see it.

Compared to the US government, I&#39;m far less concerned about what China does with my data. The Chinese government can&#39;t send masked secret police to my home to abduct me.

Sure if you narrowly define which department you mean then we can say the same thing to China. In the mean time I think Maduro will disagree about the USA operating police in other nations.

Sure, if you move the goal posts then you can redefine your argument however you want - but if you insist...https://freedomhouse.org/repor... [freedomhouse.org]

I&#39;m only disagreeing with your arbitrary idea of where you set the goalposts in the first place. They weren&#39;t in the correct position for the ball game being played.

No one complained about Obama - but Trump Bad....

Obama - Approximately 3.1 million deportations.Trump - Around 1.6 million deportations.

And how many masked men did Obama deputize? How many American citizens did these masked men murder under Obama? Zero.

I&#39;m only sad that you&#39;re not being deported in lieu of the immigrants contributing to actually making American great rather than your efforts of simply tearing the country down with bullshit partisan politics.

You DO know that the CCP literally has secret police all over the world and they actually do abduct people and bring them back to China or make them disappear or both?In the literal sense of those words, not in the orange-man-TDS-screeching sense.

The Chinese government can&#39;t send masked secret police to my home to abduct me.Federal police can arrest you for violating federal law. Of course. (Calling an arrest an &quot;abduction&quot; is just lame.)
You do know that you can peacefully change federal law, right?  Just elect senators and representatives who will do so to your liking. We could call it &quot;democracy&quot;.
You would have to actually convince voters that they want the immigration floodgates to open wider though, and I think you know that you can&#39;t really do that.So you choose street violence instead.

Sooner or later we&#39;ll have geopolitically aligned software. The Israeli pager attack showed how dangerous it is to not have a friendly superpower produce your electronics. The same problem exists in software, perhaps to an even greater degree.

In that world I expect open source to win, because that&#39;s the only way to create trustworthy software while avoiding doing a huge amount of duplicate work.

The US has been afraid of those &quot;nefarious Asians&quot; for over a hundred years now.

It&#39;s sort of funny how often people with extremely niche perspectives consider them to be universal but suppressed. I&#39;d tell you to stop telling on yourself but that ship sailed years ago.

It would racist if the rules said &quot;Chinese engineers,&quot; but it says &quot;Chinese companies.&quot;

Nothing stops those companies from relocating to say Singapore.

Maybe this is less about security and more about who gets paid?

no the software will be written by an america company who out sources it to the same people who they took it form.

Honestly I see exactly the concern with this: Always available cameras with an always eye level 360 degree view high resolution camera that likely also provides distance measurement.

Just this past year, dozens of Chinese nationals were arrested in multiple countries for harassing and intimidating Chinese dissidents in those countries. It is believed that several people were kidnapped or disappeared as well.

It&#39;s not Toyota, it&#39;s everyone. Hell we just ran a story here a few weeks ago about Porches in Russia refusing to start due to communication issues. Many car vendors implemented remote key switches. Customers kept asking for them. Well not directly, but customers wanted a car that was more theft proof.

Yes greed and lazyness.

Considering sensitivity to other issues you showed, I am surprised to see that such drastic (from my point of view) intrusion to your life results in such nonchalant attitude. For example, you don&#39;t have to be a prepper to care about your insurance getting jacked up based on car tracking data or your house burglarized based on your car leaking exact location in real time.

The original Nissan Leaf had connectivity for driving stats, charge monitoring, and remotely turning on the AC before you set off so that the car is defrosted and warm using AC power. It was free and was supposed to become a paid service, but they never got around to charging for it.

The driving stats were of limited use. The charge monitoring was useful. The remote AC/defrost is one of the best features of EVs.

What killed it in a lot of Leafs is that the originals had 2G modems, which are no longer supported by the networks. You can replace them with an open source module with a more modern modem and your own SIM.

Our government is the problem.They&#39;re well beyond what they&#39;re allowed to do at this point in terms of surveillance, and the law doesn&#39;t protect people like it should.Cars shouldn&#39;t be building psychometric profiles on you and selling them to everyone and anyone who wants to know how often you&#39;ve used your drink holder.

The adversaries to personal freedom here are local.

You can expect the quality of these cars to drop rapidly as tested, debugged software is replaced by hastily lashed together vibe coded crap.

Maybe that&#39;s the point. Easier for the US government to hack it.

I don&#39;t think Pooh and the CCP believe that. They folded over COVID lockdowns, and that&#39;s not the only example.

The US government is the biggest problem. Any adversary we&#39;re importing products from is also a problem.

If you&#39;re concerned about your government having info on you, you should be concerned that they would be able to buy it from another entity which got it from your foreign adversary, or even directly. Why not charge your adversary for partial information on their own citizens?

How much Chinese code in Linux and other car related OSS?

For example are Shawn Guo and Huacai Chen from China?

https://insights.linuxfoundati... [linuxfoundation.org]

yep, they should stop using Linux in cars, mobile phones...

Tesla sells well in China, what if US software is banned?

American car makers are apparently scared sheepless that Chinese EVs would be a big hit. As usual, they employ the government to screw with the market instead of improving their vehicles. Your take on this should be to accept their evaluation that American cars aren&#39;t worth buying.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

Trump has called for elections to be “nationalized,” something neither the president, nor the federal government, has the authority to do. But as he’s already sent the FBI to raid Fulton County, Georgia’s election offices with director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and with the midterms on their way, it’s time to ask how much damage a vindictive president could do.

Guest:  Ari Berman, voting rights reporter at Mother Jones.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/dutch_data_protection_ivanti/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) says it was one of the many organizations popped when attackers raced to exploit recent Ivanti vulnerabilities as zero-days.

Justice secretary Arno Rutte and secretary for kingdom relations Eddie van Marum co-authored a letter to the Dutch parliament, confirming that an attack involving January&#39;s Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) bugs led to a data breach.

The attack took place on January 29, the letter confirmed, and affected employees of both the AP and the Council for the Judiciary (RVDR).

Attackers may have accessed personal data including names, business email addresses, and phone numbers.

The senior ministers did not comment on the scale of the breach in terms of specific numbers, but said all of the affected individuals have been informed directly.

And to whom does a country&#39;s data protection authority report itself in such cases? The answer is its data protection officer, in this instance, while the AP&#39;s usual staff are looking into the breach at RVDR, which reported itself to the authority as normal.

While those investigations remain ongoing, the country&#39;s cybersecurity agency (NCSC-NL) is keeping tabs on the Ivanti EPMM vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340) and working with partners to understand additional threats the vulnerabilities present.

The Dutch office of the CIO (CIO Rijk) is also examining whether there is a broader risk to the central government, the letter stated.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed CVE-2026-1281 (9.8) was exploited in the wild by adding it to the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) list shortly after initial disclosure.

Ivanti&#39;s security advisory at the time stated: &quot;We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.&quot;

However, warnings from outside sources suggested the attacks could be more frequent than the vendor&#39;s &quot;very limited&quot; phrasing would suggest.

In its own warning about the Ivanti bugs, the UK&#39;s National Health Service (NHS) highlighted that EPMM devices are exposed to the web by design, making them ripe targets for attackers.

It said: &quot;Edge devices like EPMM are internet-facing by design and are highly attractive targets to attackers, and there are an increasing number of edge device vulnerabilities disclosed each year that are rapidly exploited by attackers.

&quot;The NHS England National CSOC assesses it is highly likely vulnerabilities discovered in edge devices will continue to be exploited as zero-day vulnerabilities, or shortly after vendor disclosure.&quot;

Benjamin Harris, CEO at watchTowr, also said around the time of the bugs&#39; disclosure that EPMM devices are often used by high-value organizations, according to intel gleaned from the company&#39;s own customer base.

&quot;While patches are available from Ivanti, applying patches will not be enough. Threat actors have been exploiting these vulnerabilities as zero-days, and organizations that are, as of disclosure, exposing vulnerable instances to the internet must consider them compromised, tear down infrastructure, and instigate incident response processes.&quot; ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/azure_west_us_disruption/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft suffered a service disruption over the weekend after a power incident at an Azure datacenter in the West US region affected Windows Update.

According to the Windows giant, between 0800 UTC on February 7 and 0423 UTC on February 8, &quot;multiple Azure services&quot; in the region suffered &quot;intermittent service unavailability, timeouts, or increased latency.&quot;

A wide variety of services were affected, including the Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Confidential Compute and, ironically, Azure Site Recovery.

Microsoft blamed the stoppage on &quot;an unexpected interruption to utility power at one of our West US datacenters,&quot; which, &quot;resulted in a loss of power to parts of the facility.&quot; Backup power systems were activated, but it took until 0423 UTC on February 8 before Microsoft declared the issue mitigated.

However, rather than just being another outage in a long line of problems, this one hit Windows Update and the Microsoft Store. At 1634 UTC on February 7, Microsoft admitted that the datacenter power outage had also impacted &quot;customers&#39; ability to complete operations in the Microsoft Store and Windows Update.&quot;

&quot;As a result, some users may experience failures or timeouts when installing or updating Microsoft Store apps, or when downloading Windows updates.&quot;

Affected administrators received almost a three-hour reprieve from the company&#39;s update flow while Microsoft&#39;s engineers worked on the problem. By 1930 UTC on February 7, the company confirmed that the services had been restored. It added: &quot;Some IT administrators may continue to experience residual latency affecting Windows Server update operations, including the Windows Server sync API. This Server-specific issue is being addressed separately.&quot;

Microsoft has had a bad run of incidents and outages lately. As well as having to push out out-of-band releases to deal with broken updates, the Azure cloud service has had more than its fair share of problems. Blaming a degradation of service in the West US region on an &quot;unexpected interruption to utility power&quot; is likely to raise questions, given the widespread use of UPS systems and the time taken to declare the incident mitigated.

Alternatively, with CEO Satya Nadella deciding that Microsoft needs someone to focus on engineering quality, perhaps the first act of the appointee was to choke off Windows Update. Certainly, losing several Azure services in the West US region is less than ideal, but at least there were a few hours without Windows Updates. ®

            <h2>SpaceX back to Falcon 9 launches as Musk eyes 'self-growing' Moon city</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/spacex_resumes_falcon_9/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX resumed launching Falcon 9 rockets this weekend after last week&#39;s second stage incident. At the same time, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company has shifted its focus to &quot;building a self-growing city on the Moon&quot; within a decade.

The second stage issue, which resulted in a failed deorbit burn and subsequent reentry over the Southern Indian Ocean, was due to &quot;an off-nominal condition caused by a failed ignition due to a gas bubble in the transfer tube ahead of the planned deorbit burn.&quot;

Launches of the workhorse rocket were halted while an investigation took place. Shortly after, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told The Register: &quot;The FAA will oversee every step of the investigation, approve the final report and any corrective actions.&quot;

A few days later, the FAA gave SpaceX the nod to resume launches and said in a statement: &quot;The FAA oversaw and accepted the findings of the SpaceX-led investigation. The final mishap report cites the probable root cause as the Falcon 9 stage 2 engine&#39;s failure to ignite before the deorbit burn.

&quot;SpaceX identified technical and organizational preventative measures to avoid a reoccurrence of the event. The Falcon 9 vehicle is authorized to return to flight.&quot;

So all good? Kind of. On February 7, at 2058 UTC, SpaceX launched another 25 Starlink satellites from Vandenberg. The successful mission cleared the path for the upcoming Crew-12 mission, but far greater challenges lie ahead.

These were articulated in a post on X (formerly Twitter) by Musk, who wrote: &quot;SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years.&quot;

The word &quot;potentially&quot; is doing a lot of heavy lifting. SpaceX was awarded a contract in 2021 to build a lunar lander variant of its Starship rocket. However, a few short years later, NASA admitted that the company was behind schedule and reopened the competition for the landing contract, with a view to getting boots on the Moon&#39;s surface by the end of Trump&#39;s second term in 2029.

SpaceX responded with a progress update that was heavy on renders and mock-ups but light on actual details.

At the end of January, Jeff Bezos&#39; Blue Origin announced it would pause its New Shepard flights and shift resources to accelerate the development of the company&#39;s lunar capabilities. In 2023, Blue Origin unveiled a cargo version mock-up of its Blue Moon lunar lander. The prospect of the company accelerating the development of the human-rated model cannot be far from Musk&#39;s thoughts.

However, given that SpaceX has yet to put a Starship into orbit (though it might finally do so this year), Musk&#39;s &quot;less than 10 years&quot; is optimistic, even if the funding spigot is turned on. ®

            <h2>Europe's sovereign cloud spend set to triple as geopolitics bite</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">European spending on sovereign cloud infrastructure services is forecast to more than triple from 2025 to 2027 as geopolitical tension drives investment in homegrown services, according to Gartner.

Worldwide sovereign cloud spending is forecast to hit $80 billion in 2026, up 35.6 percent from 2025. The Middle East and Africa (89 percent growth), Mature Asia/Pacific (87 percent growth), and Europe (83 percent growth) are projected to lead, while the US (29 percent growth) and China (26 percent growth) are growing at a more modest rate.

Europe – defined as geographic Western Europe including the UK – faces the most dramatic change, growing from a much higher base than other regions: $6.9 billion in 2025 compared to $851 million for Mature Asia/Pacific.

European concerns over reliance on the US hyperscalers stem from the US CLOUD Act of 2018, which allows American authorities to compel US-based tech companies to provide requested data, regardless of where that data is stored globally. Trade and geopolitical tensions between Europe and the US since President Trump return to power intensified these worries, with customers fearing the unpredictable US president could order hyperscalers to halt services to specific customers.

Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor, was among those sanctioned by the US over efforts to prosecute Israeli officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following an investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Khan later had access to Microsoft services temporarily cut. A spokesperson for Microsoft said it had not cut services to the ICC as a whole - yet onlookers worried the two issues were linked. The court later decided to adopt OpenDesk, an open source office and collaboration suite delivered by the German Centre for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS).

Speaking to The Register, Rene Buest, Gartner senior director analyst, agreed geopolitics was a factor in European sovereign cloud decisions since January last year.

&quot;There is a lot of uncertainty being created, and this uncertainty is not good for an organization, because they don&#39;t know how to plan. This geopolitical situation and turmoil have an indirect impact on the digital infrastructure strategies, because decision makers – not just CIOs, but the entire C-level – are asking whether we can still rely on digital infrastructure from US-based service providers. Nobody really knows, and they have to manage that uncertainty and get back more certainty.&quot;

A broader issue of strategic or economic sovereignty was influencing investment decisions to make local and regional cloud providers more competitive.

&quot;The only way of doing so is to spend on those providers,&quot; Buest said.

Schwarz Gruppe, owner of supermarket giant Lidl, has invested €11 billion in STACKIT, its regional cloud provider, while French provider OVHcloud has made similar investments. However, the level of investment and total capacity are still dwarfed by those of US providers.

Late last year, Catherine Jestin, executive vice president of digital at Airbus, told The Register that partnerships between US and European companies – Google with Thales in France, Google with T-Systems in Germany, and Microsoft with Orange and Capgemini in France – are an opportunity to build skills in Europe to promote further investment and capacity.

&quot;That&#39;s a little bit like what Airbus did after the Second World War. We learned about aeronautics by working under license of US products. And then, thanks to that, we were able to develop our own skills and industry around it.&quot;

She said Airbus was aware of the risk of business interruption that comes with being reliant on US providers – a risk that was very low on likelihood, but very high in terms of business impact. Such thinking was now driving market engagement.

&quot;The questions that I have is there any existing European infrastructure that would be that capable to deliver that service. That&#39;s why we are launching this request for proposal to say, &#39;OK, this is what we want to put in a sovereign cloud tomorrow, tell me, if you can, what part of it you can manage,&#39;&quot; she said.

Buest said European businesses are considering local and regional sovereign cloud providers for new cloud workloads, rather than moving off existing relationships with US providers, for the time being.

&quot;It&#39;s not really about the migration. It&#39;s more about the new workloads that are being developed right now and the workloads that still sit on premises that will be migrated,&quot; he said.

While European users are hoping to migrate services from US hyperscalers, the level of integration with those providers&#39; proprietary services is creating a barrier to complexity, he said.

The US provider market has seen a slew of announcements with providers offering so-called &quot;sovereign&quot; services to European users. Microsoft has promised data processing in Europe in what it calls the EU Data Boundary, including in-country processing for Microsoft 365 Copilot interactions in 15 countries.

Amazon Web Services made its European Sovereign Cloud generally available in January, expanding so-called Local Zones, which the vendor says are &quot;entirely located within the EU, and physically and logically separate from other AWS Regions.&quot;

Google and Oracle have also taken steps to strengthen cloud sovereignty in Europe. However, European users are not convinced these services will mitigate the risks currently concerning them, Buest claimed.

&quot;US cloud providers have technically isolated organizations or environments in Europe. Oracle and AWS, they also have created a kind of governance structure around it, with its own organization in Germany, with own managing directors and advisory boards.

&quot;But the AWS European Sovereign Cloud GmbH is a 100 percent subsidiary of Amazon Inc. There are still dependencies. Both Oracle and Amazon are still operating in these clouds. They don&#39;t give up control, and there are dependencies on the US parent companies.&quot;

The Register asked AWS, Google, Microsoft and Oracle to comment. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Taiwan&#39;s vice-premier has ruled out relocating 40 percent of the country&#39;s semiconductor production to the US, calling the Trump administration&#39;s goal &quot;impossible.&quot;

In an interview broadcast on the CTS channel, vice premier Cheng Li-chiun said she made clear to US officials that Taiwan&#39;s semiconductor ecosystem cannot be moved and its most advanced technologies will remain domestic.

&quot;When it comes to 40 or 50 percent of production capacity being moved to the United States... I have made it very clear to the US side that this is impossible,&quot; she said, according to The Straits Times.

Cheng led Taiwan&#39;s January&#39;s trade delegation to Washington, which secured reduced US tariffs on Taiwanese goods - from 20 percent to 15 percent - in exchange for increased investment into America&#39;s tech sector.

At the time, US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC the deal aimed to relocate 40 percent of Taiwan&#39;s entire chip manufacturing and production capacity to America.

A Department of Commerce release cast the agreement as a &quot;massive reshoring of America&#39;s semiconductor sector.&quot;

Taiwan, which produces more than 60 percent of global semiconductors and roughly 90 percent of the world&#39;s most advanced chips, insists it gained this leadership position by investing in the tech when other countries didn&#39;t.

Former Intel chief Pat Gelsinger supports this view, publicly stating a couple of years ago that countries like Korea, Taiwan, and China put in place long-term industrial policies and investment in chipmaking, while the US and European nations failed to do the same.

Cheng reiterated this in her interview, saying that &quot;an industrial ecosystem built up over decades cannot be relocated.&quot;

Taiwan views its semiconductor dominance as strategic defense against Chinese aggression. Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory and threatens reunification by force if necessary. Even Lutnick acknowledged this &quot;silicon shield&quot; dynamic last year, noting China&#39;s open ambitions:

&quot;We need their silicon, the chips so badly that we&#39;ll shield them, we&#39;ll protect them.&quot;

TSMC considered relocating its chip fabs in 2024 due to China threats but decided against the idea given the difficulties.

Any Chinese invasion would devastate the global tech sector, as The Register pointed out recently. Most of Nvidia&#39;s GPUs are made in Taiwan, as are AMD&#39;s processors and Qualcomm&#39;s smartphone chips. The supply of these would be cut off by any invasion, and there is no other source these companies can easily turn to. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Brussels has accused Meta of breaking EU competition rules by locking rival AI chatbots out of WhatsApp, opening the door to emergency action that could force the tech giant to let competitors back onto the platform.

The European Commission has sent Meta a Statement of Objections, setting out its preliminary view that the company abused its market position by blocking third-party AI assistants – including OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT and Microsoft&#39;s Copilot – from accessing and interacting with users on WhatsApp.

The move escalates an investigation launched in December 2025 into whether Meta is using its messaging dominance to tilt the AI assistant market in its own favor.

At the heart of the dispute are changes Meta announced in October 2025 to the WhatsApp Business policy. According to the Commission, those updates effectively banned general-purpose third-party AI assistants from operating on the platform.

OpenAI quickly announced it would no longer be available on WhatsApp, where it had more than 50 million users. &quot;We would have much preferred to continue serving you on WhatsApp,&quot; the company said, before blaming the policy changes for the move.

Microsoft followed suit, yanking Copilot from WhatsApp the following month. &quot;Copilot on WhatsApp has helped millions of people connect with their AI companion in a familiar, everyday setting,&quot; Redmond sobbed, noting that a transition was needed due to WhatsApp&#39;s policy change.

The restrictions, which came fully into force on January 15, left Meta&#39;s own chatbot, Meta AI, as the only assistant allowed to plug directly into WhatsApp.

Competition regulators said on Monday they preliminarily believe Meta holds a dominant position in consumer messaging across the European Economic Area, largely due to WhatsApp&#39;s enormous user base. In Brussels&#39; view, the app is becoming a crucial gateway for AI assistants trying to reach consumers, meaning blocking rivals could choke off competition before it properly gets going.

The Commission warned that Meta&#39;s policy risks causing &quot;serious and irreparable harm&quot; to the market for AI assistants. Officials fear the restrictions could raise barriers to entry, strengthen Meta&#39;s foothold in AI distribution, and squeeze out smaller players hoping to gain traction in the rapidly expanding sector.

Because of those concerns, regulators said they are considering interim measures that could compel Meta to restore competitor access while the broader antitrust probe continues. Such emergency steps are rarely used and typically signal that regulators believe waiting for a final decision could permanently distort the market.

Teresa Ribera, the Commission&#39;s executive vice president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, cast the case as an early test of how competition law applies to AI ecosystems.

&quot;Artificial intelligence is bringing incredible innovations to consumers, and one of these is the emerging market of AI assistants,&quot; Ribera said. &quot;We must protect effective competition in this vibrant field, which means we cannot allow dominant tech companies to illegally leverage their dominance to give themselves an unfair advantage.&quot;

Meta pushed back on the Commission&#39;s position. In a statement to The Register, a spokesperson said there is &quot;no reason&quot; for EU intervention and argued AI assistants have multiple ways to reach users, including through mobile app stores, operating systems, devices, websites, and partnerships.

The spokesperson also noted that a similar dispute was previously tested in Brazil, where courts dismissed arguments that WhatsApp represents a critical distribution channel for chatbot services.

Meta now has the chance to respond to the Commission&#39;s objections and defend its policy. If Brussels ultimately rules against the company, it could face hefty fines and orders to change how WhatsApp integrates with third-party AI services. ®

            <div id="article-text">Roland Busch on AI-powered factories, tariffs in the Trump era, trade, and the future of NATO.

Today, I’m talking with Roland Busch, who is the CEO of Siemens.

Siemens is one of those absolutely giant, extremely important, but fairly opaque companies we love to dig into on Decoder. At a very basic, reductive level, Siemens makes the hardware and software that allow other companies to run and automate their stuff. Everyone has seen the Siemens logo somewhere, whether it’s under the hood of their cars, stamped on control systems in fancy buildings, or scattered across factory floors. But since it’s not really a consumer-facing company, it’s hard to know what ties all these ideas together — and what some 320,000 Siemens employees across the world are actually working on.

How all those people are organized and work together is wildly complicated. Roland and I spent some real time just talking through the Siemens corporate structure, which, for my true Decoderheads out there, was incredibly fascinating.

Verge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here.

We also spent a lot of time talking about automation broadly and what happens as AI brings automation from the physical world of factories into the digital world of accounting and procurement — the things that help decide what factories should be doing. Roland’s vision is for Siemens to automate the whole factory process, upstream and downstream of actually making things. And you’ll hear him describe that outcome as fairly utopian: a smooth, seamless, optimal operation. Very German. But I wanted to press him on how dystopian it sounds to me. Because in Roland’s vision, it seems like there’s a whole class of people who just… don’t have jobs anymore. And the ones who do have jobs don’t really have a whole lot of autonomy or fulfillment from them, but basically just serve as the hands for the all-seeing AI. So I asked him fairly directly about that.

And if that’s not already all complicated enough: Siemens is a government and defense contractor on both sides of the Atlantic and a company whose overall growth is directly tied to free trade and globalization in the postwar era. A lot is going on right now that might challenge how the world works, especially if tensions keep rising between the US and Europe, and so I had to ask him point-blank: Do you think about what you’ll do if NATO collapses? Because that’s not as far-fetched a question as it used to be.

There’s a lot in this one, and Roland was game for it all. I think you’ll leave with a lot to think about — certainly more to think about whenever you see all those Siemens logos.

Okay: Siemens CEO Roland Busch. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Roland Busch, you are the president and CEO of Siemens. Welcome to Decoder.

It’s nice to meet you as well. There’s a lot to talk about. Siemens is a huge company. It has a long history. You’ve been in a lot of businesses, you’ve been out of a lot of businesses. You have worked there since the ‘90s. The world is very complicated right now, and Siemens is a very big, very complicated multinational operating in that world. I’m curious how you are thinking of all that.

So let me just start at the start: Siemens isn’t a consumer company. I think a lot of Decoder listeners have seen the logo, but maybe don’t understand the company. How would you describe Siemens today? What is the company?

Indeed, it’s not that easy. We have come a long way. It’s been more than 170 years since the company was founded, and we made so many changes in our portfolio and in our company. Actually, when people talk about it, I say there’s one constant in our history, which is that we reinvented ourselves over and over again. And absolutely, we are now in the midst of another reinvention or transformation with one difference. This is the fastest and most fundamental one we ever had because of technology. And then people ask, “What is Siemens about? Because you now have Siemens Healthineers, you have Siemens Energy, you have Siemens?”

And actually, it’s not that easy to describe. Siemens Healthineers has the task in its name. It’s about healthcare. Siemens Energy has the task in its name; it’s about energy. But Siemens is not that clear. So here is how I explain it. We transform, with our technology, every day for everyone. Okay, that doesn’t get you closer. But now, the point is that you have to look behind the curtain, and then you see what Siemens technology does.

When you see a car passing by… Eventually, all cars will be touched by Siemens technology. It is either cars that are designed by our technology, or they are manufactured by it. Every third manufacturing line in the world is run by Siemens controls. If you walk through New York, you cannot walk a block without passing by a building that is automated by Siemens technology. I think we are controlling ... I mean, something like a little bit less than 50 percent of electrons are touched by Siemens technologies in our distribution systems, low voltage systems. And if you talk about healthcare, if you get a scan somewhere in the world, the likelihood that it’s a Siemens CT or MR scan is a little bit shy of 50 percent. And this is what we do. We produce. We have technology which enables others to transform their everyday. And that is what Siemens is about.

So I listen to that, and I experience Siemens everywhere. I’m the person who pays attention to how a building is automated. I talk to a lot of car CEOs; I hear about Siemens as a supplier to the car industry quite a bit. It sounds like what you were describing basically is you operate things for people, or you build technologies or products that operate other things for people.

There are a lot of things in the world to operate. How do you organize the company? How do you think about where there’s opportunity and where there’s growth and investment, and then how do you think about your resources? Because it seems like we operate things for everyone. That’s a pretty wide remit that you could focus down in any number of ways.

This is an absolutely valid question because now we are active in so many different industries. It’s industries, manufacturing, process industries, but we are also in buildings, grids, and mobility. So people, trains, and signaling systems. The first basis of Siemens is — and this is where our value sits — in our technology platform, and in our design software. We have one of the largest software companies in the world. If it comes to industrial software, we are the largest. And with our software, you can build the most comprehensive physics-based digital twin of whatever product you do. And we are now expanding into molecules. So another one is automation technology, as talked about, or it can be for discrete process manufacturing. We also go for software-defined automation, which is kind of a disruption. Anything. We are the largest automation company. We are automating grids, we’re automating buildings, we’re automating signaling systems, we’re automating trains, and we are automating manufacturing. So the underlying technology is where the value is.

Now, we are bringing this technology to different verticals, so markets. It’s the industrial markets, food and beverage, chemicals, automotive, machine builders, utilities, mobility operators, and the like. And then at this point, the domain know-how comes into play. So having technology is one thing, but having the domain know-how to deploy it, to talk customers’ language, is another one. And on top, quite obviously, is that the whole thing is now supercharged by AI technologies, which we are rolling in as we speak. We have a long history regarding AI. Actually, one of the first supercomputers to do machine learning algorithms was Synopsys. I mean, this was in the ‘90s. Siemens had the most powerful one. This was the great-grandfather of the GPUs today.

And since then, we have been working with artificial intelligence technologies, but this is now a new level that we want to bring it to. So the organization, obviously, we are organizing according to businesses. They are reflecting the markets we are acting in, but you have to look at it from the back, the underlying technology, including the data, which is super relevant.

I’m very curious to talk to you about AI and automation. I think that’s very important. Digital twins, I’m curious about that. It seems like the future of automation is very rich. We’re moving from Siemens automating a lot of atoms, automating the physical world, to automating bits, and that’s a long conversation that I want to come to.

I just want to stay focused on the company for one more turn here and ask the Decoder questions, because I feel like the structure of Siemens says a lot about the company itself. I was reading your last letter to shareholders. You were talking about how you’ve divested portfolio companies where you weren’t the best owner, you’re exiting some businesses, and you’re obviously investing in others. How is Siemens organized today? How is the company structured?

We run according to businesses. One is digital industries, which is all about the software, the automation piece. One is smart infrastructure. Here you’ll find our building technology, medium voltage, low voltage, but also the grid, grid automation, grid control, and grid soft control software. The third element is Siemens mobility, where we have our trains, high-speed locomotives, commuter, metro, light rail, but also rail infrastructure, including turnkey projects, which is part of that. And the last one, since we are still consolidating, is Siemens Healthineers, where we still hold some 70 percent. It is its own listed company, a DAX-listed company. We are about to let go. We announced a spinoff of 30 percent from 65-ish, but it’s a separate company. So that’s how we’re organized. Of course, we have our corporate organizations, like strategy. IT, we run horizontally. We have our M&A department, and I talked about our portfolio. So that’s what a corporation normally has.

And maybe one more special thing is that we still have research. We still invest 8 percent of our revenue, so $6.5 billion, a portion of which goes into research advancements. We work on a quantum computer. We don’t build them, but we run on the software, the middleware, how to use it, and the applications. And we have also machine learning and KEI experts who are doing research there, like AI experts. So that’s roughly how the company runs. And then talking about regions, we have in total, including Healthineers, 320,000 people. We have 45,000 people sitting in the United States, 30,000 in China, 35,000 in India, and roughly 85,000 in Germany. It’s still a German company. There’s a lot of manufacturing here.

Let me ask you about that split between regions. I think a theme on Decoder recently, and you are a part of this trend, is that a lot of these companies are a lot bigger than people think. You described divisions, you described regions. Those are both potentially first-order organizations for companies, right? I talk to lots of CEOs, and regions are just the first-order organization. Other companies are divisions. You have both. How do those interact?

Yeah, I can tell you, this is a constant discussion because we have very strong regional leads. We have strong businesses. So this is a matrix, and every company has this matrix, and the first question is, which one is the predominant line? Is it the business or the regions? In our case, it’s a clear answer; it’s the businesses. So the businesses have the full P&L. Regions are, let’s say, the second derivative behind it. Still very strong. And we have, in some businesses, let’s take, for example, our low voltage business, switching technology, this business is fully run by regions. You have China, you have the United States, you have Europe, and this is their P&L. So roll it up by regions. If you talk about automation, the next level is still ... It’s motion control for machine builders, it’s factory automation, it’s process automation, and then come the regions. Therefore, you still have a different kind of setup depending on the business on how we serve technologies.

And then the third dimension, just to make it a little bit more complicated for you, is the verticals, because factory automation… Take factory automation, which is maybe the strongest automation business we have; they run into any kind of factory automation you can imagine. The discreet and hybrids, food and beverage, and automotive machines. Machine builders are by machine, control is another one, but then you have a lot of battery manufacturing, and you have semiconductors. Therefore, this is the third dimension to serve verticals, because each of them has a different language and different applications. So we are having a very, let’s say, three-dimensional matrix, but there’s a clear lead, and this is driven by the business lines.

Yeah. I ask everybody on Decoder how the businesses are structured. And the joke I always make is, if you tell me how the company is structured, I can tell you 80 percent of your problems. But in the case of Siemens, it seems like I’m still trying to figure it all out to even get to where the problems are. When you think about that organization, and you describe things like a common platform or shared innovation across these zones or the investments you need to make in AI, a lot of your competitors are new. They’re essentially functionally organized.

There’s one person driving the business in the case of some of these startups. Siemens is very old. It’s organized divisionally, and then obviously, there are layers of organization between it. How do you think about investing in the core technologies, the core platforms in that structure? Because it seems like all of your divisions should be doing it, perhaps in redundant or repetitive ways.

Yeah, and you’re right. When I explain my organization, you can identify the problems or the opportunities, put it that way. And here comes the point. I talked about how we are investing $6.5 billion into R&D, and obviously, this goes into different businesses. And some of them have a higher share. This is 8 percent on average. Some of them are sitting on definitely more than 10 percent, 13 percent, 15 percent, some others are at 3 percent and 4 percent. So, capital allocation, is it R&D? Is it in CapEx, or also spending? That’s done business by business. Each of them has a business case, and we allocate capital. In some cases, we obviously want to allocate more capital in higher growth areas. And I talk about organic capital allocation if it comes to M&A. This is something that happens on the board. We come up with proposals, and we see where we want to spend more money and where we focus our M&A, and where we do not.

But then here comes the point, and this is the part of our ONE Tech company program. Actually, I started last year, together with my fellow board members, maybe one of the most fundamental transformations of our organizations, because you’re completely right, we are very much boxed. Below these businesses I talked about, like digital industries, we have software, and then we have automation. Automation is three boxes: factory automation, process automation, and motion control. Below that, we have even segments, so I just didn’t give you that complexity as well. We are very much boxed. And what we want to do is take layers out, so we bring that into bigger boxes. Actually, we are targeting six units. But then we also say we want to create fabrics, which is a kind of operating system where we have horizontal ones. So we have a data fabric, a technology fabric, and we have a sales fabric.

So the idea behind this fabric is it’s a thin layer, but it’s a very strong one where we are really scaling horizontally as much as we can. For sales fabric, for example, we want to use the same tools, the same nomenclature for customers. And believe it or not, if I ask today how much revenue we do with BMW, people have to run out and pile the numbers together. This stops now because we have one identifier for BMW, and with a push of a button, I know what to do. So they serve the same sales methodology. Also, the customer journeys should all be alike. Technology fabric is that we don’t do things over and over again. When we talk about a digital platform where we sell, we build it only once and sell our portfolio.

So this is a change. We are unboxing our organization in two little boxes. And the reason is… Number one is technology, and AI in particular doesn’t respect silos. AI doesn’t respect data silos, doesn’t respect any kind of boundaries. The world is squeezing out the small. You see that this is adding more and more, and the more data you have, the more capabilities you have, the stronger you are. It’s a fact. Look at the big companies. Therefore, we have to play to the strengths of Siemens, and this requires a different way of running this company. This is behind our ONE Tech company program, which is really pulling in horizontally as much as we can, yet respecting different go-to-markets and different kinds of technologies or applications of technologies, depending on the verticals we are serving. So, not losing our strengths, which we have built over so many years, while scaling horizontally. Does it make sense?

It does. I’ve never been so excited to talk about structure with anyone as I have been with you, because that seems very hard. Well, it seems like what you’re describing to me is a multi-hundred-year-old company that has traditionally been very divisional, trying to get to some functional structures so that you can move faster. And that traditionally has come with culture cost, it has come with disruption inside the company, it’s come with inertia. How are you dealing with that at a company the size of Siemens? There are 320,000 people. They can’t all be happy with you.

It’s hard. It’s hard. So where do you start? Give a little bit of insight into how we did in the past and how we do it right now with our ONE Tech company program. In the past, we had many restructurings and many changes. The point was a managing board, these are typically something, but we have now seven people, and we used to have 15 or more, whatever. In the past, these guys were going together with their strategies in a room, defining a new structure, laying out a new org chart, and then, “Dear colleagues, this is where we want to go, and we reshuffle.” Okay. You can imagine how that goes down. This time, we created a north star where we want to be. The north star is basically what I sketched to you, these fabrics, the businesses, but allow them to focus on what they need to do, focus on their customers, on their applications, but yet we want to get horizontals into it.

And then we said, “This is a north star and here are, we call it tracks, the tracks to the north star. These are the points where we really want to touch.” For example, our CRM system for automation was completely scattered. We want to do that, and this is a blueprint for the whole company, which can go on and on. And then we engaged people to say, “Let’s go,, and you work with us now on these tracks and how to change it.” That means we give the people an opportunity to contribute, to bring their ideas, but we have a clear idea of where we want to go in order to move first. Secondly, you obviously need to communicate a lot. You have to explain what you do because you’re describing something where people don’t know where it goes; they’re not experienced to work that way. But you have to talk about it over and over again, explain why we do it, what the benefits are, and what changes for the people.

And for some, they said, “I don’t experience any change.” “Yes, because we don’t touch everything. We touch only things where you really can improve.” And some we just let go, because why would you fix something that’s not broken? The next one is that we train our people, because transformation is not just shifting boxes; it’s a different set of values. Collaboration is a much, much more important element in it. So we are putting a lot of emphasis on helping them also. And change is not only a structure, but it’s also the processes behind the way you lead. And the last thing is, obviously, you also want to inject capabilities from the outside, on a higher level, where you have people who know what good looks like when it comes to a super professional sales organization, when it comes to AI technologies and more developing models, and this helps a lot.

And then we do that all over the company, on the lower level, and the higher level. But if you talk to a really high-level person, if you come with people who really have the gravitas, who bring the experience where nobody would doubt that if they say, “This is how modern software looks like,” they have authority themselves without giving them the stars and stripes. They just put people together and say, “This is how we go.” And people listen and follow. So this is the package, and you need all of them, all of them, in order to make this transformation.

And I can say it seems to work. I had a huge respect for it. I’m a lifetimer at Siemens, and I saw in my 30 years so many changes and programs. And before pulling the trigger for this big change, which is the deepest one for the last at least 20 years, you think about it twice, because if this vessel runs in the wrong direction, you have a problem. And we have to deliver at the same time. But I pulled the trigger because I knew that we had to change. The environment of technology is changing so fast, so we have to be at the forefront, but I’m quite happy because it has been running for one year and is making good progress. There’s another one ahead of us. By the end of the fiscal year… So by the end of this, by October, November, we are basically through with all the big moves and the changes, and we are already grooving in the first batch of changes we made. Sales seem to work quite well. We are grooving in. And then within two years, I would say we are ready to scale.

Let me ask you the other Decoder question I ask everybody. This is a big decision. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions?

The first thing about decisions is empowerment. Don’t pull every decision up to the boardroom. It makes us slow. It is really not attracting people. People want to really make decisions on a lower level. So basic ideas, deciding on the lowest possible level. However, empowerment is not anarchy. If you have a clear strategy with those set boundaries, this is where I want to go. Within that frame, within your responsibility, you can act and are empowered. Empowered is a two-way street as well. Empowerment gives freedom, but it also requires accountability. So if you empower somebody, they have to be accountable for what the people are doing, which is super important. This is the first thing. So don’t decide on things that you can decide on a lower level.

But then, if it comes to, let’s say, the bigger rocks, the M&A decisions, this really goes into a very ... I mean, we have processes, how we do it. We had a “P” proposal, which is a proposal where somebody says, “This is a company I want to acquire. This is my business case.” Outside in, in order to say, “Okay, now we believe in that.” You give your trigger, you already know how to negotiate, go forward, and make a non-binding offer. And then they work on it. We have a lot of processes, and when it comes up, we call it an “I” proposal where we finally pull the trigger to say, “Now you can invest, and you can go.”

And the decisions are, when it comes to strategies, engaging as many people as we can, the experts, listening to them in the boardroom. In some cases, we also ask them not to prepare a super-polished PowerPoint. That’s not the point. We want to really get the content. And then we have a very open discussion culture in our management board with our leaders to make better decisions. Very often, I’m also snorkeling around. We are getting advice from others, pulling our network if it comes to certain decisions. But I would say it’s a structured process, but it’s a process which encourages people to speak up, to bring their opinion in order to come to better decisions.

Let me ask one more question here, then I want to talk about the state of the world, and I really do want to talk about how you see AI and digital twins fitting into automation, because there’s a lot there.

Let’s say I’m a Siemens engineer working on low voltage switch gear. I’m one of 35,000 people in India, and I’m like, the CEO’s at CES talking about fabrics with [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang on stage, and we’re in the middle of a two-year transformation ... But I just need to get my work done, and this is all just some corporate strategy distraction. How do you bring those two things together? Because this is the thing that kills projects at big companies. It kills them dead. And the number of times I’ve heard that story is very high. So how do you bring that together?

I know. There’s the first one, and this is so super important for communication because, and you got it right, low voltage. This is as mechanical as it can get. This is mechanical stuff, so it’s no software, no KEI, if not in the development, of course. But normally, this is a product that is hardware. Not only because we have now solid state switching, which is disruptive, which brings software into it, but take that aside. And then talking about being on stage, talking about KEI, new models, and digital twins, the people sometimes feel lost. Push is always talking about that stuff, but I’m just doing mechanicals. So we have to give love to these guys as well because they do a lot in terms of contributing to top and bottom line cash flow to our company. They are part of the equation.

If you go to any kind of customer, they say, “I love your automation. I love your software, but still I have to do some switching here,” and we are rolling in. And it’s super relevant because if you don’t have a switch or if it breaks, then you have a problem. So they bring the capabilities to a customer and say — we also have some low voltage here — but really say, “This is important for you to have a very solid operation.” It makes sense, and they are proud to contribute. So you have to distribute your love not only to the new stuff, but also to those that are basically super important and carry our P&L forward. And then the other element is, believe it or not, this CES presentation or keynote where you really are on par with ... I mean, Jensen’s there, Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] is there, and you show what we do and people ... Even the low voltage guys are proud of what we do.

I’ll give a last one because I have to share it with you. We didn’t talk about a completely different area, which is mobility, Siemens Mobility. They do trains. This is hard stuff, boogies, frames, mechanical. These trains are super loaded with automation. These are basically software-defined trains because they tell you whatever ... Even before they come to the depot, they tell the depot what they need, which part, what’s wrong, and how to replace it. So it’s technology at its best. However, which company can say that we are transforming the whole economy of 110 million people in a country, which is Egypt? It’s where we built 2,000 kilometers of railway lines from the north to the south, west to the east, connecting 90 million people and transforming the whole system with high-speed commuters and locomotives. This makes people proud, and I didn’t mention any AI technology, even though it’s in our trains, but this is something where we could say, “Who? Which and who? Which company in the world can do that?”

I’m very curious about all of that. I think there’s some amount of, you said, software-defined low voltage switches or software on the trains. Those worlds are colliding. I want to ask broadly just about the landscape you’re operating in to do all of that work. These are big opportunities at work. If you want to sell trains, you need to be a global company. You can’t be a single country train supplier. You have to operate everywhere.

I look at Siemens and its size and its history, and I say, “Okay, this company took advantage of globalization and free trade.” You’re in all these countries around the world, you’ve got tens of thousands of people all over the place, you’re building products all over the place, you’re taking advantage of the opportunities and the markets you’re in, the talent that’s in those markets.

And then I look up, and I read the newspaper, and the walls are going up around the world, everywhere, every single day. The Trump administration seems intent on putting ever-higher walls between the US and Europe, in particular, which seems very confusing to me. Other countries are nationalists in other ways. How are you thinking about Siemens in that moment, where a company that was able to grow and be such a large provider to so many people because of free trade and globalization, now has to contend with ever-higher walls and barriers between countries?

Obviously, we believe in free trade more than trade barriers because it brought the world to where we are, and leveraging all technology as fast as possible means bringing it to different countries as fast as possible. The good news about it is, and I mentioned our footprint before, since we are global from the very beginning… By the way, when Werner von Siemens founded this company 175 years or more ago, he sent one brother to London and one to Russia because he knew Germany was too small for his technology to scale. Ever since, Siemens has been a global company. And now our local for local content in the United States or China is 85 percent, 87 percent. So that means we are so local, and we have goods traveling from different places. So the impact on tariffs currently, and we said it last year, it’s a public figure, in 2025 last fiscal year was a low, mid-single-digit bottom-line impact.

Okay, that’s good for us. It’s maybe not good for others. Our customers are suffering, and with our customers, we are suffering, obviously. We know that machine builders have a reduced volume because their machines are tariffed when they go to the United States. Along with that, normally comes a Siemens Automation, so we see that, but the direct impact is rather low. It’s a second impact. And we are increasing our resilience as we speak. As it comes to certain semiconductors, we are trying to double source as much as possible, which we didn’t do before, in order to scale. We are looking for more localization to invest in the United States. We doubled our capacity for low voltage, medium voltage switching. We invested in assembly lines for trains. Investing in the United States. We are investing in India and China because that is one of our largest markets. Therefore, the good news is that we are quite resilient. Bad news is that for many, many of our customers, it doesn’t help, and it somehow slows down.

When you talk about investing in manufacturing in the United States, I’ve watched a lot of companies say a lot of things about investing in manufacturing in the United States. I’m from Racine, Wisconsin. I watched Foxconn insist that it was going to build an LCD factory in Racine, Wisconsin, and then simply not do that. And I watched Tim Cook reopen a factory that was already making Macs, so Donald Trump, in his first term, could say that Apple was opening a factory. There is a lot of theater about manufacturing in the United States, and then there’s the reality of investing for the long term when presidents come and go. How are you balancing that? Is it theater? Is it real investment? What is the split?

So the truth is, it’s a little bit of both. Where it’s real, let’s talk about the pharmaceutical industry. This is real investment. The Swiss ones, the German ones, are investing in pharmaceutical production in the United States. Some car makers that are not that strong, do that. But the big wave of remanufacturing in the United States is not happening yet. We don’t see that. And the reason is, maybe you mentioned it, number one, is the availability of people, also trained people. It is that you don’t know yet where the whole tariff situation will settle at the end of the day. The other reason is, why are we in a world that looks this way? It’s because American companies, in particular, were basically leveraging low labor costs and low costs in other countries, and they made a good living out of it. And you mentioned some of them as well. So do I believe that this will change? Yes. I believe there will be a wave, and we do see more manufacturing coming.

And I didn’t mention semiconductors. Definitely, this is a hard fact. Semiconductor builds. Maybe even battery factories would come, pharmaceuticals, and the like. The only point I always advise our customers is that if you build a new manufacturing line in the United States, make it as automated and as digital as possible for obvious reasons, because you cannot get enough labor, let alone trained labor. And technology is there. So if you go there with a greenfield planned, you have all the freedoms to make this whole thing digital before even sending the first excavation machine. Your products, digitalizing your manufacturing, simulate everything. That’s what we do, by the way. Whenever we build a new one, we go all in. And then you build it. It’s faster. You don’t make mistakes in building. It increases your space productivity and reduces your energy consumption. It increases your output while having more variables and more variants of your products. So that will come, but we thought it would come faster; it seems there’s a delay in really ramping up manufacturing in the United States. And again, maybe sector by sector, you’ll see different patterns.

Do you think that’s because people assume that there will be a snap back to normal trade relations in the world, or do you think it’s just slow?

The latter one. I don’t believe these tariffs will just snap back. Why? Tariffs, more or less, are like taxes, and they help close the budget deficit. And I never saw taxes going back. I hope that this may come to more normal terms. For example, our machines, which are exported to the United States, suffer from tariffs, but they also face these tariffs on aluminum and steel on top of that, which makes them quite expensive. So maybe that goes away. There might be some adoptions, which I think will come, but I don’t believe that this goes back to where we came from.

Look, I have a rudimentary understanding of economics.

I studied this as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago 20 years ago. My understanding of all this is that this is how you equalize labor rates. You say, “Okay, you can make the products cheaper overseas. We’ll just put a tariff on top of it. Now the product is as expensive as making it in the United States, so you might as well make it here.” And that is bluntly what the Trump administration is haphazardly trying to convey. But what you’re saying is, “We’re Siemens. We make automation. We can virtually model the entire factory as a digital twin before you build it. In AI, we can automate even more. We can automate people using Excel to program your factory. Just build that.” And I look at that, and I say, “Well, that didn’t get anybody a job.” I look at data center investment in the United States, and communities around the United States are pushing back on data centers because they’re like, “This is a lot to extract from the environment and from our land, and not enough jobs.” And I see that same argument being applied to fully automated factories.

How do you push back against that? Is a fully automated factory a net addition to the economy, do you think?

It’s a net-add with fewer people per output, if you don’t automate. Absolutely. That’s absolutely clear. The point is, we are living in aging societies. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China are aging. There’s a really steep curve. So sooner or later, you will see that creating jobs like crazy is maybe not the point because you’re missing jobs anyhow, or labor anyhow. You might want to deploy the labor you have in jobs that you cannot replace. The social system, the healthcare system, and the like, use labor really where it makes a difference. And in manufacturing, you have less and less. This is changing. You still have people on our shop floor, but you will have fewer. And you said it right, an AI factory fully automated, this uses a lot of space, uses a lot of energy, and it creates a limited number of jobs. That’s what an AI factory is. Yeah.

I’m just saying, if I build a fully automated factory to make cars, but no one has a job, who buys the cars?

Again, as I said before, what you do when you have full auto manufacturing, you’re driving the economy, you grow faster. You can bring the production to the United States, which has value in it. And once the economy is growing, obviously, your GDP per capita is increasing, and people are going to buy cars, but they have a different deployment.

But where do they get the money? Again, a rudimentary understanding of economics.

So number one is you’re replacing blue collar workers with more trained workers, with engineers, maybe also blue collar workers using AI technology. So a factory doesn’t run without... Again, we have higher output with fewer people, but you still have ... I mean, I talked about it, the whole service sector is super relevant, and they’re missing people as well. Germany, for example, I can share about that. If we do not have hundreds of thousands of immigrants, and most of them working in service jobs, including hospitals and the like… If I take them out of the equation, our whole healthcare system would collapse. So there are a lot of jobs that you cannot replace. And that’s one more thing. When people ask me what to study, I say, “Okay, a solid education in mathematics or physics is always good, but if you don’t really feel like it, you can go for a plumbing job or a handicraft job, because that is the last job to be replaced.”

Yeah. The world needs electricians and plumbers for sure. That much I understand. Someone’s got to build and plumb the data centers, and maybe that’s the only career in the future. So your vision is like a fully automated factory. You’re talking about the higher-order jobs, like information jobs, technology jobs, and engineering jobs. I would call those software jobs. In some broad categorization, there’s some amount of white-collar work that has a laptop involved. That’s the next thing you could automate with AI. And you’ve made some gestures at that, right? We can automate even more of the things.

As I mentioned earlier, it seems like a lot of the frame for how you’re thinking is, Siemens has traditionally automated atoms, now you can automate bits.

And I see so much excitement about AI automating bits. How are you thinking about that, moving up from, okay, you’ve decided how many units to produce, we’ll produce them, to we’re going to actually automate the deciding of how many units to produce?

And this goes really deep because… And this is when we talk about this industrial operating system, an AI-based operating system, where you really talk about this manufacturing line, which is finally ... Running autonomously is a big word, but we are getting closer and closer to doing that. And here comes the point. Number one, it obviously starts with — and I’ll come to manufacturing in a second — but it starts with the design of your product. You create a digital twin of your product, and you simulate how it runs on a manufacturing line. And this loop of producing and simulating and producing your products, which you already have in the digital world, is so powerful. Because whenever you make a change, a component, maybe you want to be more resilient when designing another component, you go all the way back to your design drawings, you change it, and you know which part of manufacturing is impacted. So that’s very powerful.

But let me speak on the manufacturing line itself. The whole idea is that you start building this operating system, which is a layered system. Obviously, you need to get all the data that your manufacturing line produces. You have to connect to all your machines, the status of your machines, enrich them with environmental data, as you want to get the real-time data, even the drawing data of your machines as well, because once you have that, and you simulate it ... And this is what we call the digital twin composer. That means you’re sucking in different digital twins of a machine, of a line, of a product; you suck it in, and then you have a complete, comprehensive digital twin which ingests real-time data. Then you can go forward and backward in time, and you can find out what the problem is.

And then here comes the real one, when you close the loop of ingesting data but sending data back to the line, which is then the agent, which behaves on behalf of you. An agent is like a trained supervisor for a line. So when a red light is blinking, a supervisor goes there, looks at it, and says, “Oh yeah, this is a problem. I know that, over and over again, this is what I have to do.” And this is what AI agents can do. Finally, you still need somebody who is removing a blockage, changing, or updating. Maybe updating the software will be automatic, but changing a part, changing a piece, or having a switch where something is going wrong, you need people who know what to do. We tell them what to do with glasses. I also presented it at CES.

So this helps you interact in your natural words and helps you fix things, even if you don’t know all the details. This is where agents come in, or orchestration agents, which are supported by a machine building agent, a machine agent, a product agent, a workflow agent, whatever. And that’s how the future looks, which is very powerful. It keeps your yield high, your quality process very high, and you’re super agile if there’s any change or change in your production because you have a different version you want to produce. It’s super smart, and it doesn’t take a week to reassemble your line, but it really goes automatically.

When you talk about industrial agents… So there are some lines, something’s gone wrong, a warning light goes off, and you say an agent will help you figure out what’s wrong and potentially fix it by itself. Is that based on an LLM? Are you using one of the models from one of the big companies, and it’s just an LLM that you’ve trained to think about a line in that way?

Yep, but not only that. It’s based on an LLM, different ones, depending on which one we are working on and different use cases, but it’s based on an LLM, but it’s not good enough. If you only use an LLM or an LLM-based agent to fix a problem, the hit rate is near what we need, but we are training these LLMs on our data, on proprietary data, product data, machine data, and operation data. Once you have that, and even the data of fixes in the past ... Remember, when you’d walk a [manufacturing] plant, and you’d see the whiteboard where a supervisor writes, “I have a problem here, this is who is working on it, and here I fixed it.” All that knowledge goes into this model so that you just say, “Okay, this is the pattern of a problem. This is what the fix was.” The model knows it because we upload the data.

So it’s a model that is trained. This is why we talk about an industrial AI model, which is trained on industrial data. Fundamental, if it really runs across, but also very specific, if it comes to certain machines, then the hit rate goes up from 60 percent, 70 percent, to the 95-ish/8-ish plus, which is really what you can do then.

Are these your models that you’re training, or are you augmenting models you’re taking?

We are augmenting. We don’t do LLMs, so really large models that are trained on the whole of knowledge in the world. This we don’t do [in house]. This is what we’re using any kind of, for specific tasks. We have some models which are very good in software, copilots, and agents for software. And now we are working on really genuine and new product designs, not only just having the next code line, but really genuine designs, a completely different world. And in some cases, we’re working on copilots on the shop floor. We talk about Microsoft, for example, and we are having the first use cases doing that. So, challenges, of course, are that an industrial AI application doesn’t accept hallucination. You really have to be sure that once you send an agent out, it does what you want it to do.

This is my fundamental question, and I’ve asked a lot of people this. I’m very curious about your perspective, because the domain is so different. I am not convinced that LLM technology, as it exists today, can make the leap to do all of the things that people want it to do. You see the gaps. Even as you’re saying, an LLM on its own hallucinates enough to only be effective 60 percent to 70 percent of the time. That’s nowhere near good enough for all of the things people want it to do — especially at the labor replacement rates that some of these folks talk about. Do you think it’s good enough, or do you think it’s the actual augmentation that makes it, the products that you build with it, good?

And actually, I’m also going to ask the second part of that question. Do you see LLM technology, the core technology, improving at a rate that might change your assessment of it?

Good point. To the question, LLMs will get better and better, but I don’t believe that these LLMs, if you do not train them really on specific industrial data, and this is where the augmentation comes from… You can train them as well, and as long as we want, but they will not get to the level that we can use on the shop floor. It will not work. I strongly believe that the LLMs need specific, domain-specific, machine-specific data in order to really make a difference. But then, if you do that, then you really can make a step up, which is fundamentally higher. I can give you two examples, which are maybe interesting. One is an optical inspection task where we used an LLM and said, “Okay, show me the problem.” Hit rate was okay-ish, but not to the level we needed. Then we start training the model with not so much data, which is anyhow important because if you’re manufacturing at a PPM level, guess how many mistakes you get a day? But on those that you have made, you then create some synthetic data around those.

Once you train the model, your hit rate goes up substantially. It’s much, much higher than if you use the next best and next best models. Is there convergence? To some extent, I do believe there’s a certain ceiling where you can train as well as you want, but if you do not get specific training, then you have a problem. Now, my second example is, and now I will give you a little bit of the spirit of how deep you have to go… We have an Italian manufacturer, they make robots, a crib in the box, a crib in the box for any kind of parts. And obviously, you can train a robot to make this crib in a box. What we did was create this wholly in the digital world. We used a digital part with a digital arm, digital software, a digital camera, and maybe everything, and we trained a robot over and over again on this crib in the box with our technology. And then we switched it on, and the hit rate was still not satisfying, 70-odd level.

It’s amazing now because we trained for hundreds of hours virtually. Then we used Nvidia technology with a photorealistic ray tracing of these pieces, photorealistic ray tracing at different lights, and trained the model over again. The hit rate was jumping up substantially. So these little details of having a normal representation of a digital part and a really photorealistic one made the hit rate come up substantially. And this is also the reason why when you train robots now in the virtual world, it doesn’t really work. There’s a reason we have so many people who are standing there with some handles and training robots to do a job and train over and over and over again, because this is real training on the real stuff. And these little details make a difference between an industrial application and one that you cannot use. What I’m saying is that training models on specific data, on valuable design data, operation data, and time series data, brings them to the level that we need in order to deploy them.

All that data has to come from lots of different customers, and you talk about Siemens as having all that data. But that data actually belongs to your customers. Are they willing to let you aggregate so that you can develop the products at the scale that you’re talking about?

So don’t underestimate the amount of data we have. I talk about generations of design data for controls, for trains, for switches, and whatnot, number one. Number two is that we have, I don’t know, how many thousands of machines we are operating. We have machines, we have machine jobs, machining jobs. But if we then go to my AI guys, they say, “Okay, you make everything available now from Siemens?” Then they say, “Ah, still not enough.” They need so much data to train models. Now we have an alliance for machine builders, German machine builders, nine of them. I mean top, top, top. These are the names, Trumpf, DMG Mori, and the like; they are ready now to share their data with us to train models, to bring them a model that they can use to make an application that makes their machines run autonomously.

So you just say, “This is the part, here’s the machine, and just get going.” They know that their data is not very useful because it’s too little, but if you add up, if you create these data alliances, it works. It requires a certain trust. This is again where Siemens comes in because they trust us. We have been partners for decades now. We are very mindful of that one. So you’re right, you need as much data as possible. You need as much proprietary data as possible. Would they share the data of their absolute latest machine with us? No, but don’t need that. It can use all the other ones, which is absolutely helpful.

Let me wrap up with just a big picture question here. I’m just thinking about Siemens as a company and what it represents, and all the places it is around the world, and the value of this scale. You have 320,000 people in all the places around the world. And then I just think about the barriers going up. And Siemens is a defense contractor for both the United States government and Europe, and a bunch of other countries around the world. Are you planning for an event as catastrophic as the dissolution of NATO? It’s great to be like, we can aggregate all the data from all our customers, but also the world might fall apart. Are you thinking about Siemens as a global company in that context?

Yes, we do. If you ask me, do we make a kind of scenario planning of another war or whatever, some incident in Taiwan, we don’t really, because I told my people we cannot do that over and over again. It comes in different forms. So, therefore, why would you? Stay agile and be really fast if something happens. So this is one thing. On the other side, we see obviously the trends in the world, and we are working more and more on what we call the forging of technologies. So, local for local, that you do not always rely on certain technologies from the United States used in China for China and the United States, or for Europe. So it’s a pity because normally you would like to scale, and we still have core technologies which we can multiply, but obviously, getting ... For example, we are training our industrial AI applications for China on Chinese LLMs, whereas for the United States, obviously, we train them on American hyperscalers or whatever, LLMs.

So we have good experiences also, and this makes us more resilient. Can I do that for everything? Can I fork all my software? I could, but it’s just prohibitively expensive; it doesn’t make sense. But for certain areas, we do that and increase our resilience and hope for the best.

I realize I’m ending on a down note here, but it just seems like so much of what you’re excited about is the opportunity of scale, the opportunity to do these things cooperatively, in a way that maybe changes the world economy, and all of us are just caring for robots in the end. But these are huge global ideas that you have, and I’m just trying to put them in the context of, boy, when I hear other people talk about AI, it is in the context of national champions and international competition in a way that feels very old.

It does not feel like the world of the past 20 years. This feels like a return to a different time. And I’m just wondering how you can keep the optimism of the scale and the globalization when that is happening all around you.

Maybe I have this optimism because I’m working in one of the most international companies in the world. We are a Chinese company, as we are a United States company and a European one, and we have so many great people all around the world. And I’ll also see how they are collaborating, and I believe that this is a core value of societies, which is super, super relevant for the future. There might be times where this is not appreciated so much for whatever reason, but in the long run, I believe that a world which is using technologies in order to solve the real problems in the world ... We have to feed 10 billion people now. We are creating our climate and whatnot. And we have aging societies where healthcare is a huge problem. So we cannot solve it if we box ourselves too small, so scale it. And here I hope that when we have waves of opening and closing and whatnot, that ultimately this pays out if you are acting in a global international network as we do, and therefore I’m more optimistic.

What should we be looking for next from Siemens?

I think the next thing is that we are walking the talk. We talk about that we are building this industrial AI operating system, that we are using AI now for the next level to really not only validate, but also create, that we are leveraging our capabilities of bringing the real world and the digital world together, because the digital world can do so much if you do not have an impact on the real world. We show that with our customers, like PepsiCo, which was showing at CES, like Kyron, the supply chain or logistics company, or many, many others. And to see that we can be the entry door for AI technology into the real world together with our partners at scale.

Roland, this has been great. I could do another full hour just on the structure of Siemens. I think, as you can tell.

You’re going to have to come back. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

The ads will appear in a separate area beneath your chat.

OpenAI plans to start testing ads in ChatGPT today, according to a report from CNBC. The “clearly labeled” ads will appear in a separate area beneath your chat, OpenAI announced last month.

A source close to the situation tells CNBC that OpenAI “expects ads to make up less than half of its revenue long term.” Last week, Anthropic showed off a Super Bowl commercial poking fun at OpenAI, saying “ads are coming to AI,” but not to its AI chatbot Claude. The version of the ad that aired during the game was a little less direct after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the campaign “clearly dishonest.”

OpenAI will show ads to logged-in users who use the app for free or subscribe to its cheaper Go subscription. The company says it will “keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers,” but notes that the ads will still be “optimized based on what’s most helpful to you.” Advertisers won’t have an impact on ChatGPT’s answers, according to OpenAI.

In an internal memo seen by CNBC, Altman tells employees that OpenAI plans to launch an updated chat model this week, coming just days after the company released a more advanced version of its AI coding agent, Codex. Altman also reportedly said that ChatGPT is “back to exceeding 10% monthly growth.” OpenAI last reported having 800 million weekly users last October.

            <div id="article-text">Beginning in March, all accounts will have a ‘teen-appropriate experience by default.’

Beginning in March, all accounts will have a ‘teen-appropriate experience by default.’

Discord announced on Monday that it’s rolling out age verification on its platform globally starting next month, when it will automatically set all users’ accounts to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless they demonstrate that they’re adults.

Users who aren’t verified as adults will not be able to access age-restricted servers and channels, won’t be able to speak in Discord’s livestream-like “stage” channels, and will see content filters for any content Discord detects as graphic or sensitive. They will also get warning prompts for friend requests from potentially unfamiliar users, and DMs from unfamiliar users will be automatically filtered into a separate inbox.

Direct messages and servers that are not age-restricted will continue to function normally, but users won’t be able to send messages or view content in an age-restricted server until they complete the age check process, even if it’s a server they were part of before age verification rolled out. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, said in an interview with The Verge that those servers will be “obfuscated” with a black screen until the user verifies they’re an adult. Users also won’t be able to join any new age-restricted servers without verifying their age.

Discord’s global age verification launch is part of a wave of similar moves at other online platforms, driven by an international legal push for age checks and stronger child safety measures. This is not the first time Discord has implemented some form of age verification, either. It initially rolled out age checks for users in the UK and Australia last year, which some users figured out how to circumvent using Death Stranding’s photo mode. Badalich says Discord “immediately fixed it after a week,” but expects users will continue finding creative ways to try getting around the age checks, adding that Discord will “try to bug bash as much as we possibly can.”

It’s not just teens trying to cheat the system who might attempt to dodge age checks. Adult users could avoid verifying, as well, due to concerns around data privacy, particularly if they don’t want to use an ID to verify their age. In October, one of Discord’s former third-party vendors suffered a data breach that exposed users’ age verification data, including images of government IDs.

A government ID might still be required for age verification in its global rollout. According to Discord, to remove the new “teen-by-default” changes and limitations, “users can choose to use facial age estimation or submit a form of identification to [Discord’s] vendor partners, with more options coming in the future.”

The first option uses AI to analyze a user’s video selfie, which Discord says never leaves the user’s device. If the age group estimate (teen or adult) from the selfie is incorrect, users can appeal it or verify with a photo of an identity document instead. That document will be verified by a third party vendor, but Discord says the images of those documents “are deleted quickly — in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”

Badalich also says after the October data breach, Discord “immediately stopped doing any sort of age verification flows with that vendor” and is now using a different third-party vendor. She adds that, “We’re not doing biometric scanning [or] facial recognition. We’re doing facial estimation. The ID is immediately deleted. We do not keep any information around like your name, the city that you live in, if you used a birth certificate or something else, any of that information.”

However, some users may not have to go through either form of age verification. Discord is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.

“If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich says.

“A majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”

She goes on to explain that the addition of age assurance will mainly impact adult content: “A majority of people on Discord are not necessarily looking at explicit or graphic content. When we say that, we’re really talking about things that are truly adult content [and] age inappropriate for a teen. So, the way that it will work is a majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”

Even so, there’s still a risk that some users will leave Discord as a result of the age verification rollout. “We do expect that there will be some sort of hit there, and we are incorporating that into what our planning looks like,” Badalich says. “We’ll find other ways to bring users back.”

﻿The stream will be more than an hour long.

Nintendo and Xbox each had their turn, and now PlayStation is up. Sony just announced its next big State of Play showcase, which will stream on February 12th at 5PM ET. There aren’t many details on what to expect, but Sony says that the event will be more than an hour long and include “eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.”

That said, we can make some guesses for games that are likely to appear. Saros, the sci-fi shooter from Returnal developer Housemarque, is out in April, while Marvel games like Wolverine from Insomniac and Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls from Arc System Works are both expected in 2026. Sony also just revealed a multiplayer Horizon Zero Dawn spinoff last week, which seems like a good candidate to be featured, as does Bungie’s Marathon which is out in just over a month. It’s been a while since we heard much about Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, as well.

Of course, those are just the games we know about already, but with an hour to fill, it’s likely this State of Play will include a handful of surprises. Bloodborne remake? A guy can dream.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of Nintendo’s biggest success stories began as a very different game.

Despite the convoluted journey between concept and finished product, despite all the many things that change between initial prototype and whatever ends up in players’ hands, something always remains of the initial feeling that inspired a video game. If you know what to listen for, it’s easy to hear the echo of that original idea. Pokémon was born from a fascination with creatures, Zelda from nostalgia for the freedoms of childhood. Animal Crossing, meanwhile, was born from loneliness.

Katsuya Eguchi left his home prefecture of Chiba, east of Tokyo, to join Nintendo in 1986. He found it hard to adjust to living in Kyoto. “When I moved . . . I left my family and friends behind,” he told Edge magazine in 2008. “In doing so, I realized that being close to them—being able to spend time with them, talk to them, play with them—was such a great, important thing. I wondered for a long time if there would be a way to re-create that feeling, and that was the impetus behind the original Animal Crossing.”

Eguchi had a long career at Nintendo—he was a level designer on Super Mario Bros. 3 and Yoshi’s Story, and director on Star Fox and Wave Race 64—before the opportunity to explore his idea of a “communication game” arrived in the late 1990s. Nintendo was working on a floppy disk drive add-on for the N64, called the 64DD. Its disks had a then-ample 64 Mb of rewritable storage, which would allow players to save things that they created. It had the ability to connect to the internet, to share those things. And, most important for the game that would become Animal Crossing, it had a real-time twenty- four-hour clock. This meant that a game could continue to operate on its own schedule, whether you were playing it or not. Something new could be happening whenever the player turned up.

This article is adapted from Keza MacDonald’s book Super Nintendo: The Game-Changing Company That Unlocked the Power of Play, out now.

This wasn’t the first time that Nintendo had released a disk-writing add-on for one of its consoles: the Famicom Disk System sold 4.4 million units in Japan between 1986 and 1990, and it is very fondly remembered there. You could bring a Famicom disk into a game shop and rewrite it for a fee on a charmingly retro-futuristic- looking kiosk machine, from which you could also fax high scores from the disks directly to Nintendo to participate in tournaments. You can still buy bright-yellow Disk System–themed holders for your metro or bank cards in Nintendo’s department stores, featuring its charming mascot, Diskun (Mr. Disk).

Nintendo made a big fuss about the 64DD when it was announced in 1996, showing a demo of a Zelda game that would become Ocarina of Time. But it was, in the end, one of Nintendo’s hardware failures. It was released in Japan only in December 1999 and discontinued in February 2001, having sold about 15,000 units. Almost all of the soft- ware that had been in development for it ended up being transmog- rified and released in some form on the N64 or the GameCube. This is what happened to Eguchi’s “communication game”: It appeared in 2001 on the N64 under the name Doubutsu no Mori, or Animal Forest, the last game ever released for that console. Unlike the hardware it was initially developed for, it did not become a footnote in Nintendo history. Instead, it became one of its slow-burn successes.

Animal Forest is an odd game. Slightly eerie, even. You arrive as a vacant-eyed stranger in a strange place, the only human in a population of chattering animals, and immediately you are railroaded into purchasing a house from Tom Nook, an arch-capitalist tanuki landlord, whom you must then pay back bit by bit. Each player’s cartridge was home to a unique, individually generated town, with space for four people to build a home, decorate it, talk to the animals, send and receive letters, and go hunting for shells, insects, and fish around the rivers, trees, and beaches. That was it. You couldn’t finish Animal Forest; you couldn’t play it well or badly. You just kind of . . . existed within it, checking in every day to see what was happening in your virtual life, who was moving in and out of town, what special events were coming up on the calendar. It continued to exist whether you were there or not. Spend a long time away, and weeds would grow up around the village. Your neighbors would be shocked to see you upon your return.

It is astonishing how ahead of its time Animal Forest turned out to be. Technology took years to catch up with its ideas. That initial version of the game, later ported to the GameCube as Animal Crossing, sold just over two million units, but each time a new version of the game was released, it came into a world that was more suited to it. For a long time Animal Crossing was one of Nintendo’s lesser-known series, one of those deep cuts you could feel smug about importing. But by the time Wild World turned up on the Nintendo DS, in 2005, the idea of internet-enabled social gaming was becoming mainstream. That game sold almost twelve million. By 2012, when New Leaf came out on the 3DS, the concept of expressing yourself within a game and sharing your creations with others was, thanks to social media, also totally normal- ized. The result: thirteen million sales. And then, in March 2020, New Horizons was released the same month that much of the world went into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered community, creativity, relaxation, and connection to a world that was suddenly starved of all those things. It sold over forty-five million copies and became the dominant pop-cultural phenomenon of that dreadful time. Way back in 1986, Eguchi envisioned a game that might ease his loneliness. In 2020, New Horizons saved the whole world from loneliness. There are few more perfect illustrations of the power of video games.

By the late nineties, Katsuya Eguchi had settled in Kyoto. He had friends, colleagues, a wife and children. But now he had a new problem: He was often so busy at work that he didn’t have time to play video games together with his family. His wife played games, his children played games, but there was no way for them to play together if his children were already asleep by the time he got home from the office.

“I was sad that I couldn’t play games with my kids, even though I knew it would be fun,” Eguchi explained at a Nintendo company seminar in 2008. “From the beginning my idea was that, if this is the way it’s going to be, maybe there’s something we could do that would let someone in a similar situation to me come home late and play. And that would somehow overlap with what the kids had played.”

“I was sad that I couldn’t play games with my kids, even though I knew it would be fun.”

Working with the theme of “playing with others,” Eguchi teamed up with Hisashi Nogami and Takashi Tezuka, and got the green light to start putting a game together in around 1998. The prototype they developed was absolutely nothing like Animal Crossing. It was a multiplayer dungeon adventure game.

“The beginning of that design was that you’d have this role-playing- game-like world in this massive field, and multiple people would enter, and your play would affect the other players . . . For instance, say the kids were adventuring in a dungeon during the day and made it some of the way through, but then they reach a point they can’t get past. When dad came home at night, he could use the information the kids left as a hint and clear the dungeon, and proceed further. I wondered how that kind of relay-type play would be.”

The only connection to Animal Crossing in this prototype—apart from the idea of playing together—was that players could bring pets with them on their adventures. “There are lots of RPGs where you become the hero, but in the game that I was imagining, the player was powerless,” Eguchi explained. “So I thought, ok, what the player can’t do on their own, they could borrow the power of animals to overcome. That’s the first time the idea of animals came up for this project . . . There wasn’t even a hint of being able to have conversations with animals at the time.” You would have been able to get only so far with your own animal’s powers; at some point you’d need help from another player, hence the social side of the game.

It was the waning fortunes of the 64DD that forced the team to change tack. “During our original planning phase the field was incredibly large . . . There would be four different islands—one for each of the four seasons, and each island would have small dungeons that you would adventure in,” explained Nogami. “Of course, some- thing so large wouldn’t possibly fit [on a Nintendo 64 cartridge], so we thought fine—let’s make it one [island].”

“But then we asked ourselves, what could players enjoy doing in such a tiny village?” Eguchi interjected.

“We thought, well you can’t really have an adventure now, can you,” replied Nogami. “And so we said fine. Let’s get rid of the adventure.”

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

“There is no Plan B, because that assumes you will fail. We’re going to do the start-up thing until we die.”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on. “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Correction: Kovant is based in Sweden, not Germany. The article has been updated.

Update: The article has also been edited to clarify the source of the claims about the Moltbook post that Karpathy shared on X.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132319/experimental-surgery-colorectal-cancer-survivors-pregnant-birth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.
