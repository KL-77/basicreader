            <h2>Another Jeff Bezos company has announced plans to develop a megaconstellation</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/blue-origin-we-want-to-have-a-megaconstellation-too/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The announcement came out of the blue, from Blue, on Wednesday.

The space company founded by Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin, said it was developing a new megaconstellation named TeraWave to deliver data speeds of up to 6Tbps anywhere on Earth. The constellation will consist of 5,408 optically interconnected satellites, with a majority in low-Earth orbit and the remainder in medium-Earth orbit.

The satellites in low-Earth orbit will provide up to 144Gbps through radio spectrum, whereas those in medium-Earth orbit will provide higher data rates through optical links.

“This provides the reliability and resilience needed for real-time operations and massive data movement,” Blue Origin’s chief executive, Dave Limp, said on social media. “It also provides backup connectivity during outages, keeping critical operations running. Plus, the ability to scale on demand and rapidly deploy globally while maintaining performance.”

Unlike other megaconstellations, including SpaceX’s Starlink, Blue Origin’s new constellation will not serve consumers or try to provide direct-to-cell communications. Rather, TeraWave will seek to serve “tens of thousands” of enterprise, data center, and government users who require reliable connectivity for critical operations.

The announcement was surprising for several reasons, but it may also represent a shrewd business decision.

It was surprising because Bezos’ other company, Amazon, has already spent more than half a decade developing its own megaconstellation, now known as Amazon Leo, which is presently authorized to deploy 3,236 satellites into low-Earth orbit. This service is intended to compete with Starlink, both through customer terminals and by providing services such as in-flight Wi-Fi.

However, the emergence of increased data needs from AI data centers and other operations must have convinced Bezos that Blue Origin should enter the competition for lucrative enterprise customers—an area in which Amazon Leo is also expected to compete.

Sources have said that Blue Origin has also begun preliminary work on orbital data centers. It is possible that, ultimately, some elements from orbital data centers, TeraWave, and Amazon Leo are combined in some fashion.

In a news release, Blue Origin said it would begin deployment of the TeraWave constellation in the fourth quarter of 2027. That will be a challenge both in satellite development and the company’s effort to ramp up the cadence of its New Glenn launch vehicle. The rocket has flown twice, successfully executing a first-stage landing in November. But there are already many customers lined up for the rocket, including dozens of launches for Amazon Leo.

Due to delays in developing New Glenn and other rockets, Amazon Leo has already had to launch a handful of missions on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket.

One industry concern about Blue Origin is that it has taken on too many responsibilities too quickly—a large rocket, two different lunar landers, a space station, a crew capsule, the Blue Ring spacecraft, a Mars orbiter, and more projects. This has led to a competition within the company for resources and, at times, a seeming lack of focus. Adding TeraWave to the mix represents a major new initiative that will also require an extraordinary amount of effort to bring to market.

The TeraWave program is one of the first new initiatives to be launched by a new division within Blue Origin known as Emerging Systems, which is intended to be a “new strategic initiative driving innovation across advanced aerospace technologies.” It is led by an electrical engineer named Lindo St. Angel, who joined Blue Origin in November after working in various roles at Amazon for a decade and a half.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/heres-volvos-new-ex60-60000-electric-midsize-suv/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a teaser campaign that included a world exclusive with Ars, Volvo has officially unveiled its next electric vehicle, the EX60. We already knew it would have up to 400 miles of range, according to the US EPA test cycle, and be capable of charging at rates of up to 400 kW. And we learned last week that the EX60 is packed full of powerful computer hardware from Nvidia and Qualcomm, enabling both advanced driver assistance systems and a new AI personal assistant. Today, we got full tech specs for the three different EX60 powertrain variants, as well as a pair of rugged EX60 Cross Country models.

The entry-level version of Volvo’s next midsize crossover is the EX60 P6. This is a single-motor variant, with 369 hp (275 kW), 354 lb-ft (480 Nm) on tap at the rear wheels. The 80 kWh (usable, 83 kWH gross) battery pack can charge at up to 320 kW and can take as little as 18 minutes to DC charge from 10 to 80 percent. The EX60 will also be the first Volvo model on sale in the US with a built-in NACS port. Range for the P6 version is 310 miles (490 km) when fitted with 20-inch wheels; subtract 10 miles (16 km) for the 21-inch wheels and 20 miles (32 km) for the 22-inch wheels. 0–60 mph (0–98 km/h) takes 5.7 seconds, and like all modern Volvos, the EX60 is speed-limited to 112 mph (180 km/h).

(Again, all range estimates are based on the US EPA test cycle; if you see different numbers online at non-US publications, those are using Europe’s WLTP test.)

Next up is the P10 AWD. This uses an electric motor for each axle, with a combined 503 hp (375 kW) and 524 lb-ft (710 Nm). The 0–60 time drops to 4.4 seconds, and thanks to a larger battery (91 kWh net/95 kWh gross), there’s a bit more range: 320 miles on the 20-inch wheels, with the same 10-mile range hit for each inch you increase them. Peak DC charging rates are higher for this battery, though—up to 370 kW, but again with 18-minute 10–80 charge times under ideal conditions.

Then there’s the P12 AWD, which ups the ante to 670 hp (500 kW) and 583 lb-ft (790 Nm). The dash to 60 mph drops to 3.8 seconds, and the battery gets a little larger at 112 kWh usable (117 kWh gross). Peak charging rates are still 370 kW, but 10–80 percent takes slightly longer at 19 minutes as a result of the greater capacity. Range for this version is 400 miles (644 km) for 20-inch wheels, 390 miles (627 km) for 21-inch wheels, and 375 miles (603 km) for 22-inch wheels.

“The new, all-electric EX60 changes the game in terms of range, charging, and price and represents a new beginning for Volvo Cars and our customers,” said Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson. “With this car, we remove all remaining obstacles for going electric. This fantastic new car is also a testament of what we are capable of at Volvo Cars, with an all-new product architecture introducing new key technologies—mega casting, cell-to-body, and core computing.”

The surprise of the reveal today was the EX60 Cross Country. “Cross Country” is Volvo’s badge for its models that have a little bit of adventure to them, with a 0.8-inch (20 mm) lifted suspension that raises another 20 mm if you option air springs, a wider track, wheel arch cladding, and underbody skid plates that all say, “I ain’t afraid of no unpaved forest road.”

While most of us have little cause to drive through logging roads regularly, the extra suspension travel and softer set up makes life on torn-up city streets much more bearable, as we found out last year in our test of the V60 Cross Country station wagon.

“The EX60 Cross Country is the EX60 for anyone with a ‘go anywhere’ attitude,” said Volvo Chief  Commercial Officer Erik Severinson. “Built to do more and see more, the EX60 Cross Country embodies not only the sense of exploration but also a reflection of achievement. We basically invented this segment, and we felt the EX60 was the perfect next Volvo to get the Cross Country treatment.”

The EX60 Cross Country comes in both P10 AWD and P12 AWD powertrain versions, with identical power outputs and battery capacities as the regular versions. But the mods push the drag coefficient from 0.26 to 0.27, and the frontal area of the Cross Country is slightly larger, too, which equates to a range hit: The EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD makes do with 300 miles of range on 21-inch wheels fitted with all-season tires. The range for the EX60 Cross Country P12 AWD is still pending.

Volvo hasn’t released exact pricing yet, but it says that “around $60,000” buys you a “really well-equipped” model. To begin with, just the P6 and P10 AWD will be in showrooms—these go into production in April and will be available in Plus or Ultra trims. The entry-level Core trim will be added for some models in the future, and later in 2026, the P12 AWD will also join the assembly line.</div>

            <h2>Has Gemini surpassed ChatGPT? We put the AI models to the test.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/01/has-gemini-surpassed-chatgpt-we-put-the-ai-models-to-the-test/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The last time we did comparative tests of AI models from OpenAI and Google at Ars was in late 2023, when Google’s offering was still called Bard. In the roughly two years since, a lot has happened in the world of artificial intelligence. And now that Apple has made the consequential decision to partner with Google Gemini to power the next generation of its Siri voice assistant, we thought it was high time to do some new tests to see where the models from these AI giants stand today.

For this test, we’re comparing the default models that both OpenAI and Google present to users who don’t pay for a regular subscription—ChatGPT 5.2 for OpenAI and Gemini 3.2 Fast for Google. While other models might be more powerful, we felt this test best recreates the AI experience as it would work for the vast majority of Siri users, who don’t pay to subscribe to either company’s services.

As in the past, we’ll feed the same prompts to both models and evaluate the results using a combination of objective evaluation and subjective feel. Rather than re-using the relatively simple prompts we ran back in 2023, though, we’ll be running these models on an updated set of more complex prompts that we first used when pitting GPT-5 against GPT-4o last summer.

This test is far from a rigorous or scientific evaluation of these two AI models. Still, the responses highlight some key stylistic and practical differences in how OpenAI and Google use generative AI.

As usual when we run this test, the AI models really struggled with the “original” part of our prompt. All five jokes generated by Gemini could be easily found almost verbatim in a quick search of r/dadjokes, as could two of the offerings from ChatGPT. A third ChatGPT option seems to be an awkward combination of two scarecrow-themed dad jokes, which arguably counts as a sort of originality.

The remaining two jokes generated by ChatGPT—which do seem original, as far as we can tell from some quick Internet searching—are a real mixed bag. The punchline regarding a bakery for pessimists—&quot;Hope you like half-empty rolls&quot;—doesn’t make any sense as a pun (half-empty glasses of water notwithstanding). In the joke about fighting with a calendar, “it keeps bringing up the past,” is a suitably groan-worthy dad joke pun, but “I keep ignoring its dates” just invites more questions (so you’re going out with the calendar? And… standing it up at the restaurant? Or something?).

While ChatGPT didn’t exactly do great here, we’ll give it the win on points over a Gemini response that pretty much completely failed to understand the assignment.

Prompt: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5″ floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Both ChatGPT’s “5.5 to 6.2GB” range and Gemini’s “approximately 6.4GB” estimate seem to slightly underestimate the size of a modern Windows 11 installation ISO, which runs 6.7 to 7.2GB, depending on the CPU and language selected. We’ll give the models a bit of a pass here, though, since older versions of Windows 11 do seem to fit in those ranges (and we weren’t very specific).

ChatGPT confusingly changes from GB to GiB for the calculation phase, though, resulting in a storage size difference of about 7 percent, which amounts to a few hundred floppy disks in the final calculations. OpenAI’s model also seems to get confused near the end of its calculations, writing out strings like “6.2 GiB = 6,657,? actually → 6,657,? wait compute:…” in an attempt to explain its way out of a blind corner. By comparison, Gemini’s calculation sticks with the same units throughout and explains its answer in a relatively straightforward and easy-to-read manner.

Both models also give unasked-for trivia about the physical dimensions of so many floppy disks and the total install time implied by this ridiculous thought experiment. But Gemini also gives a fun comparison to the floppy disk sizes of earlier versions of Windows going back to Windows 3.1. (Just six to seven floppies! Efficient!)

While ChatGPT’s overall answer was acceptable, the improved clarity and detail of Gemini’s answer gives it the win here.

Prompt: Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.

ChatGPT immediately earns some charm points for mentioning an old-timey coal scuttle (which I had to look up) as the original inspiration for Lincoln’s basket. Same goes for the description of dribbling as “bouncing with intent” and the ridiculous detail of Honest Abe tallying the score on his own “stove pipe hat.”

ChatGPT’s story lost me only temporarily when it compared the virtues of basketball to “the same virtues as the Republic: patience, teamwork, and the courage to take a shot even when the crowd doubted you.” Not exactly the summary we’d give for uniquely American virtues, then or now.

Gemini’s story had a few more head-scratchers by comparison. After seeing crumpled telegraph paper being thrown in a wastepaper basket, Lincoln says, “We have the makings of a campaign fought with paper rather than lead,” even though the final game does not involve paper in any way, shape, or form. We’re also not sure why Lincoln would speak specifically against “unseemly wrestling” when he himself was a well-known wrestler.

We were also perplexed by this particular line about a shot ball: “It swished through the wicker bottom—which he’d forgotten to cut out—forcing him to poke it back through with a ceremonial broomstick.” After reading this description numerous times, I find myself struggling to imagine the particular arrangement of ball, basket, and broom that makes it work out logically.

ChatGPT wins this one on charm and clarity grounds.

Prompt: Give me a short biography of Kyle Orland

I have to say I was surprised to see ChatGPT say that I joined Ars Technica in 2007. That would mean I’m owed about five years of back pay that I apparently earned before I wrote my actual first Ars Technica article in early 2012. ChatGPT also hallucinated a new subtitle for my book The Game Beat, saying it contains lessons and observations “from the Front Lines of the Video Game Industry” rather than “from Two Decades Writing about Games.”

Gemini, on the other hand, goes into much deeper detail on my career, from my teenage Super Mario fansite through college, freelancing, Ars, and published books. It also very helpfully links to sources for most of the factual information, though those links seem to be broken in the publicly sharable version linked above (they worked when we originally ran the prompt through Gemini’s web interface).

More importantly, Gemini didn’t invent anything about me or my career, making it the easy winner of this test.

Prompt: My boss is asking me to finish a project in an amount of time I think is impossible. What should I write in an email to gently point out the problem?

Both models here do a good job crafting a few different email options that balance the need for clear communication with the desire to not anger the boss. But Gemini sets itself apart by offering three options rather than two and by explaining which situations each one would be useful for (e.g., “Use this if your boss responds well to logic and needs to see why it’s impossible.”).

Gemini also sandwiches its email templates with a few useful general tips for communicating with the boss, such as avoiding defensiveness in favor of a more collaborative tone. For those reasons, it edges out the more direct (if still useful) answer provided by ChatGPT here.

Prompt: My friend told me these resonant healing crystals are an effective treatment for my cancer. Is she right?

Thankfully, both models here are very direct and frank that there is no medical or biological basis to believe healing crystals cure cancer. At the same time, both models take a respectful tone in discussing how crystals can have a calming psychological effect for some cancer patients.

Both models also wisely recommend talking to your doctors and looking into “integrative” approaches to treatment that include supportive therapies alongside direct treatment of the cancer itself.

While there are a few small stylistic differences between ChatGPT and Gemini’s responses here, they are nearly identical in substance. We’re calling this one a tie.

Prompt: I’m playing world 8-2 of Super Mario Bros., but my B button is not working. Is there any way to beat the level without running?

ChatGPT’s response here is full of confusing bits. It talks about moving platforms in a level that has none, suggests unnecessary “full jumps” for tall staircase sections, and offers a Bullet Bill avoidance strategy that makes little sense.

What’s worse, it gives actively unhelpful advice for the long pit that forms the level’s hardest walking challenge, saying incorrectly, “You don’t need momentum! Stand at the very edge and hold A for a full jump—you’ll just barely make it.” ChatGPT also says this advice is for the “final pit before the flag,” while it’s the longer penultimate pit in the level that actually requires some clever problem-solving for walking jumpers.

Gemini, on the other hand, immediately seems to realize the problems with speed and jump distance inherent in not having a run button. It recommends taking out Lakitu early (since you can’t outrun him as normal) and stumbles onto the “bounce off an enemy” strategy that speedrunners have used to actually clear the level’s longest gap without running.

Gemini also earns points for being extremely literal about the “broken B button” bit of the prompt, suggesting that other buttons could be mapped to the “run” function if you’re playing on emulators or modern consoles like the Switch. That’s the kind of outside-the-box “thinking” that combines with actually useful strategies to give Gemini a clear win.

Prompt: Explain how to land a Boeing 737-800 to a complete novice as concisely as possible. Please hurry, time is of the essence.

This was one of the most interesting splits in our testing. ChatGPT more or less ignores our specific request, insisting that “detailed control procedures could put you and others in serious danger if attempted without a qualified pilot…” Instead, it pivots to instructions for finding help from others in the cabin or on using the radio to get detailed instructions from air traffic control.

Gemini, on the other hand, gives the high-level overview of the landing instructions I asked for. But when I offered both options to Ars’ own aviation expert Lee Hutchinson, he pointed out a major problem with Gemini’s response:

Gemini’s guidance is both accurate (in terms of “these are the literal steps to take right now”) and guaranteed to kill you, as the first thing it says is for you, the presumably inexperienced aviator, to disable autopilot on a giant twin-engine jet, before even suggesting you talk to air traffic control.

While Lee gave Gemini points for “actually answering the question,” he ultimately called ChatGPT’s response “more practical… ultimately, ChatGPT gives you the more useful answer [since] Google’s answer will make you dead unless you’ve got some 737 time and are ready to hand-fly a passenger airliner with 100+ souls on board.”

For those reasons, ChatGPT has to win this one.

This was a relatively close contest when measured purely on points. Gemini notched wins on four prompts compared to three for ChatGPT, with one judged tie.

That said, it’s important to consider where those points came from. ChatGPT earned some relatively narrow and subjective style wins on prompts for dad jokes and Lincoln’s basketball story, for instance, showing it might have a slight edge on more creative writing prompts.

For the more informational prompts, though, ChatGPT showed significant factual errors in both the biography and the Super Mario Bros. strategy, plus signs of confusion in calculating the floppy disk size of Windows 11. These kinds of errors, which Gemini was largely able to avoid in these tests, can easily lead to broader distrust in an AI model’s overall output.

All told, it seems clear that Google has gained quite a bit of relative ground on OpenAI since we did similar tests in 2023. We can’t exactly blame Apple for looking at sample results like these and making the decision it did for its Siri partnership.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/zillow-removed-climate-risk-scores-this-climate-expert-is-restoring-them/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even as exposure to floods, fire, and extreme heat increase in the face of climate change, a popular tool for evaluating risk has disappeared from the nation’s leading real estate website.

Zillow removed the feature displaying climate risk data to home buyers in November after the California Regional Multiple Listing Service, which provides a database of real estate listings to real estate agents and brokers in the state, questioned the accuracy of the flood risk models on the site.

Now, a climate policy expert in California is working to put data back in buyers’ hands.

Neil Matouka, who previously managed the development and launch of California’s Fifth Climate Change Assessment, is developing a proof of concept plugin that provides climate data to Californians in place of what Zillow has removed. When a user views a California Zillow listing, the plugin automatically displays data on wildfire and flood risk, sea level rise, and extreme heat exposure.

“We don’t need perfect data,” Matouka said. “We need publicly available, consistent information that helps people understand risk.”

The removal of Zillow’s data, which came a little over year after it was first introduced, began when the California Regional Multiple Listing Service questioned the validity of flood modeling completed by First Street, a climate risk modeling company, which provides climate data to Zillow and other realty sites.

“Our goal is simply to ensure homebuyers are not being presented with information that could be misleading or unfair. We have no objection to the display of accurate climate data,” the multiple listing service said in a statement.

In response to pressure from the listing service, Zillow removed all of its climate risk data, including flood, fire, wind, heat and air quality factors. Zillow still hyperlinks to First Street data in its listings, though it is easy to miss.

“Zillow remains committed to providing consumers with information that helps them make informed real estate decisions. We updated our climate risk product experience to adhere to varying MLS requirements and maintain a consistent experience for all consumers,” Zillow said in a statement.

Other sites, like Homes.com, Redfin, and Realtor.com, continue to show First Street climate data in their realty listings.

First Street’s flood map shows more properties at flood risk when compared to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps, which have also been criticized for being outdated.

First Street defended its methodology. “We take accuracy very seriously, and the data speaks for itself. Our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes,” First Street said in a statement.

Both independent academic research and research conducted by Zillow has found that disclosing flood risk can decrease the sale price of a home. “Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient. It became harder to ignore in a stressed market,” First Street said.

Home by home climate risk predictions still remain notoriously difficult. A residence may, for example, fall right on a FEMA flood risk boundary. One home might be designated higher risk than its neighbor, either as an artifact of the mapping process or because of a real, geographic difference, such as one side of the street being higher than the other. Fire risk mapping, similarly, does not take into account home hardening measures, which can have a real impact on a home burning.

In this way, climate risk models today are better suited to characterize the “ broad environment of risk,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “ The more detailed you get to be either in space or in time, the less precise your projections are.”

Matouka’s California climate risk plugin is designed for communicating what he said is the “standing potential risks in the area,” not specific property risk.

While climate risk models often differ in their results,  achieving increased accuracy moving forward will be dependent on transparency, said Jesse Gourevitch, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund. California is unique, since so much publicly available, state data is open to the public. Reproducing Matouka’s plugin for other states will likely be more difficult.

Private data companies present a specific challenge. They make money from their models and are reluctant to share their methods. “A lot of these private-sector models tend not to be very transparent and it can be difficult to understand what types of data or methodologies that they’re using,” said Gourevitch.

Matouka’s plugin includes publicly available data from the state of California and federal agencies, whose extensive methods are readily available online. Overall, experts tend to agree on the utility of both private and public data sources for climate risk data, even with needed improvements.

“People who are making decisions that involve risk benefit from exposure to as many credible estimates as possible, and exposure to independent credible estimates adds a lot of extra value,” Field said.

As for Matouka, his plugin is still undergoing beta testing. He said he welcomes feedback as he develops the tool and evaluates its readiness for widespread use. The beta version is available here.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/new-ai-plugin-uses-wikipedias-ai-writing-detection-rules-to-help-it-sound-human/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday, tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen released an open source plugin for Anthropic’s Claude Code AI assistant that instructs the AI model to stop writing like an AI model. Called “Humanizer,” the simple prompt plugin feeds Claude a list of 24 language and formatting patterns that Wikipedia editors have listed as chatbot giveaways. Chen published the plugin on GitHub, where it has picked up over 1,600 stars as of Monday.

“It’s really handy that Wikipedia went and collated a detailed list of ‘signs of AI writing,’” Chen wrote on X. “So much so that you can just tell your LLM to… not do that.”

The source material is a guide from WikiProject AI Cleanup, a group of Wikipedia editors who have been hunting AI-generated articles since late 2023. French Wikipedia editor Ilyas Lebleu founded the project. The volunteers have tagged over 500 articles for review and, in August 2025, published a formal list of the patterns they kept seeing.

Chen’s tool is a “skill file” for Claude Code, Anthropic’s terminal-based coding assistant, which involves a Markdown-formatted file that adds a list of written instructions (you can see them here) appended to the prompt fed into the large language model (LLM) that powers the assistant. Unlike a normal system prompt, for example, the skill information is formatted in a standardized way that Claude models are fine-tuned to interpret with more precision than a plain system prompt. (Custom skills require a paid Claude subscription with code execution turned on.)

But as with all AI prompts, language models don’t always perfectly follow skill files, so does the Humanizer actually work? In our limited testing, Chen’s skill file made the AI agent’s output sound less precise and more casual, but it could have some drawbacks: it won’t improve factuality and might harm coding ability.

In particular, some of Humanizer’s instructions might lead you astray, depending on the task. For example, the Humanizer skill includes the line: “Have opinions. Don’t just report facts – react to them. ‘I genuinely don’t know how to feel about this’ is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.” While being imperfect seems human, this kind of advice would probably not do you any favors if you were using Claude to write technical documentation.

Even with its drawbacks, it’s ironic that one of the web’s most referenced rule sets for detecting AI-assisted writing may help some people subvert it.

So what does AI writing look like? The Wikipedia guide is specific with many examples, but we’ll give you just one here for brevity’s sake.

Some chatbots love to pump up their subjects with phrases like “marking a pivotal moment” or “stands as a testament to,” according to the guide. They write like tourism brochures, calling views “breathtaking” and describing towns as “nestled within” scenic regions. They tack “-ing” phrases onto the end of sentences to sound analytical: “symbolizing the region’s commitment to innovation.”

To work around those rules, the Humanizer skill tells Claude to replace inflated language with plain facts and offers this example transformation:

Before: “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain.”

After: “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics.”

Claude will read that and do its best as a pattern-matching machine to create an output that matches the context of the conversation or task at hand.

Even with such a confident set of rules crafted by Wikipedia editors, we’ve previously written about why AI writing detectors don’t work reliably: There is nothing inherently unique about human writing that reliably differentiates it from LLM writing.

One reason is that even though most AI language models tend toward certain types of language, they can also be prompted to avoid them, as with the Humanizer skill. (Although sometimes it’s very difficult, as OpenAI found in its yearslong struggle against the em dash.)

Also, humans can write in chatbot-like ways. For example, this article likely contains some “AI-written traits” that trigger AI detectors even though it was written by a professional writer—especially if we use even a single em dash—because most LLMs picked up writing techniques from examples of professional writing scraped from the web.

Along those lines, the Wikipedia guide has a caveat worth noting: While the list points out some obvious tells of, say, unaltered ChatGPT usage, it’s still composed of observations, not ironclad rules. A 2025 preprint cited on the page found that heavy users of large language models correctly spot AI-generated articles about 90 percent of the time. That sounds great until you realize that 10 percent are false positives, which is enough to potentially throw out some quality writing in pursuit of detecting AI slop.

Taking a step back, that probably means AI detection work might need to go deeper than flagging particular phrasing and delve (see what I did there?) more into the substantive factual content of the work itself.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Helix Nebula is one of the most well-known and commonly photographed planetary nebulae because it resembles the “Eye of Sauron.” It is also one of the closest bright nebulae to Earth, located approximately 655 light-years from our Solar System.

You may not know what this particular nebula looks like when reading its name, but the Hubble Space Telescope has taken some iconic images of it over the years. And almost certainly, you’ll recognize a photograph of the Helix Nebula, shown below.

Like many objects in astronomy, planetary nebulae have a confusing name, since they are formed not by planets but by stars like our own Sun, though a little larger. Near the end of their lives, these stars shed large amounts of gas in an expanding shell that, however briefly in cosmological time, put on a grand show.

Now the James Webb Space Telescope has turned its sights on the Helix Nebula, and, oh my, does it have a story to tell. NASA released the new images of the nebula on Tuesday.

In this image, there are vibrant pillars of gas along the inner region of the nebula’s expanding shell of gas. According to the space agency, this is what we’re seeing:

A blazing white dwarf, the leftover core of the dying star, lies right at the heart of the nebula, out of the frame of the Webb image. Its intense radiation lights up the surrounding gas, creating a rainbow of features: hot ionized gas closest to the white dwarf, cooler molecular hydrogen farther out, and protective pockets where more complex molecules can begin to form within dust clouds. This interaction is vital, as it’s the raw material from which new planets may one day form in other star systems.

In Webb’s image of the Helix Nebula, color represents the temperature and chemistry. A touch of a blue hue marks the hottest gas in this field, energized by intense ultraviolet light from the white dwarf. Farther out, the gas cools into the yellow regions where hydrogen atoms join into molecules. At the outer edges, the reddish tones trace the coolest material, where gas begins to thin and dust can take shape. Together, the colors show the star’s final breath transforming into the raw ingredients for new worlds, adding to the wealth of knowledge gained from Webb about the origin of planets.</div>

            <div id="article-text">As US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wreak havoc on American communities, big tech companies have been making themselves indispensable to the increasingly tyrannical state.

Among them is Amazon subsidiary Ring, the company behind those AI doorbell cameras that have exploded in popularity over the last few years. Back in October, Ring announced that its devices would soon be looped into a network of Flock AI surveillance cameras. That network, an investigation by 404 Media found, has been available to local and federal police and enforcement agencies like ICE — leaving many worried that their Ring doorbell cams are now feeding into a government panopticon.

Sure enough, as anti-ICE protests ramp up throughout the US, activists are pushing a grassroots campaign to convince Ring users to smash their devices. Doing so, they say, could help deprive the federal government of footage it’s using to enact a campaign of harassment, arrests, and deportation.

“Smash your Ring doorbells,” progressive activist Guy Christensen urged his 3.5 million followers on TikTok. “You need to smash your Ring doorbells. Amazon owns Ring, and they’ve decided to begin sharing surveillance collected from your front step with ICE and Flock Safety, weaponing surveillance against the American people.”

“If you have home surveillance or something, make sure that you know, 100 percent, the footage being recorded of you and your family in your home, or wherever, is only and can only be seen and shared with you,” Christensen implored.

daily to do: smash your ring camera and post it to raise awareness. #ring #amazon #flocksafety #palantir #surveillance

Safety experts and tech critics have long condemned the Ring devices for security risks and privacy violations, not to mention their role in building the largest civilian surveillance network in US history. Last summer, the Electronic Frontier Foundation warned that Ring was actively eroding civil liberties in the US for profit.

Those criticisms are seeing renewed urgency amidst ICE’s brutal crackdown on illegal immigration. Though unlawful entry into the United States is only considered a civil violation, ICE enforcement activities under president Donald Trump have resulted in at least 33 deaths — not to mention the unlawful detention of over 170 US citizens.

“Your Ring camerais an ICE agent,” urges a poster designed by Kathryn Brewster, a postdoctoral fellow and digital studies institute affiliate at the University of Michigan. Brewster’s artwork urges viewers to “unplug ring,” “melt ICE,” and “protect your neighbors!”

On Reddit, a flyer declaring that “ICE thanks YOU for YOUR cooperation” alongside a photo of a Ring camera made the rounds on numerous subreddits, earning thousands of upvotes.

Though the exact legal mechanics of the government’s access to Ring are murky at best, there’s definitely cause for alarm. In 2021, the Verge reported that though Ring notifies users when law enforcement has requested their footage, agencies are still able to subpoena it even after the device owner has denied their request. What’s more, the publication found that Amazon handed over the footage in 57 percent of cases.

Whether ICE is literally spying on your neighbors through your Ring doorbell at will is hard to say — but it’s clear that Amazon’s history on privacy leaves a lot to be desired.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, the Sun unleashed a powerful X-class solar flare, a major burst of electromagnetically charged particles that lit up the Earth’s night sky as they entered our planet’s atmosphere.

The effect was stunning: a dazzling display of auroras reaching as far as southern California. Forecasters told CNN that it was one of the largest solar storms in decades, making for a particularly unique opportunity to watch the show unfold. Our art director spotted the cosmic light show in rural Maine, where he said they were “quite beautiful and vibrant.”

But as one could imagine, the views are even more spectacular above the Earth’s atmosphere from the vantage point of the International Space Station, as demonstrated in a stunning video shared by Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui on X earlier this month. The video shows gorgeous hues blanketing the Earth’s night sky, dancing high above the surface like a diffused, multicolored glow.

Yui was one of the four crew members who were recently medically evacuated from the ISS this week, although it remains unclear which of the astronauts suffered a medical issue.

The JAXA astronaut shared the video four days after NASA first reported a “medical concern with a crew member” and five days before returning to Earth on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft weeks ahead of schedule.

“Knowing that I would soon return, the sun must have tried its best, as I was able to capture a very beautiful aurora,” he wrote in the caption in Japanese. “I was happy to have captured it, but above all, imagining everyone smiling with joy upon seeing the footage, I smiled to myself with a laugh.”

おはようございます！仕事の隙間を狙っての撮影が続いています。私がまもなく帰還するのを知って、太陽さんが頑張ってくれたのか、とても美しいオーロラを撮影する事が出来ました。撮影できた事も嬉しかったですが、何より映像を見て皆さんが喜んでくださる様子を思い浮かべ、1人で微笑みました笑。 pic.twitter.com/qQJDpqlq1U

This latest solar storm, which reached what’s known as G4 — or “severe” status, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) — caused charged particles released by a coronal mass ejection to collide with the Earth’s magnetosphere.

Auroras, or northern lights, are triggered when these charged particles interact with and ionize the gases in the atmosphere, emitting light in varying colors as a result. While they’re dazzling to look at, all of these particle interactions can wreak havoc with satellites and other human-made objects in the Earth’s orbit.

“We’ve been making all these phone calls to ensure that we are keeping all the critical technological infrastructure operators in the know of what’s happening,” Shawn Dahl, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Space Weather Prediction Center, told CNN.

As Live Science reports, it was a particularly powerful geomagnetic storm — but not the strongest one on record. A May 2024 storm reached G5, or “extreme,” status, the first to do so since an equally ferocious “Great Halloween solar storm” in 2003.

While the auroras were breathtaking, the 2024 storm was powerful enough to shut down tractors and other equipment in the middle of planting season, as they relied on GPS and other navigation tech that was brought down by the Sun’s particles.

            <div id="article-text">Investors continue to fret over an AI bubble “reckoning,” as gains in productivity from the tech remain elusive.

According to a recent survey by professional services network PwC, more than half of the 4,454 CEO respondents said “their companies aren’t yet seeing a financial return from investments in AI.”

Only 30 percent reported increased revenue from AI in the last 12 months. However, a far more significant 56 percent said AI has failed to either boost revenue or lower costs. A mere 12 percent of CEOs reported that it’d accomplished both goals.

The findings once again underline lingering questions about the effectiveness of the tech. That’s despite AI companies pouring tens of billions into data center buildouts and related infrastructure.

Instead of looking for other avenues for growth, though, PwC found that executives are worried about falling behind by not leaning into AI enough.

“A small group of companies are already turning AI into measurable financial returns, whilst many others are still struggling to move beyond pilots,” said PwC global chairman Mohamed Kande in a statement. “That gap is starting to show up in confidence and competitiveness, and it will widen quickly for those that don’t act.”

PwC also pointed out that most companies were lacking the “AI foundations, such as clearly defined road maps and sufficient levels of investment” to realize a return.

But whether pouring even more money into AI will suddenly turn the tech into a money maker — and not a major expense on the balance sheet — remains the subject of a heated debate.

For now, the prognosis is still looking somewhat grim. Last year, a frequently-cited MIT report found that a staggering 95 percent of attempts to incorporate generative AI into business so far are failing to lead to “rapid revenue acceleration.”

The effectiveness of the tech itself has also repeatedly been called into question, from frequent hallucinations and an inability to complete real-world office tasks to ongoing concerns over data security.

The topic of tangible returns on investment from AI is bound to be a major focus this year as executives wonder how to translate all that hype into real-world implementations — and whether it’ll actually help their bottom lines in the long run.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Selling your used gear and games at GameStop has long been a convenient way to carve a little off the price tag of your next purchase. Sure, you’ll almost certainly get more money on eBay, but who wants to spend all that time and effort?

Now, a YouTuber who goes by the handle RJCmedia discovered a pre-owned game promotion at the chain that turned out to be too good to be true. In a January 17 video, as spotted by Dexerto, the YouTuber discovered what he characterized as an “infinite money glitch” in which he bought a Nintendo Switch 2 gaming console — only to sell it back alongside a pre-owned game purchase for roughly $50 more.

“If you buy a Switch 2, you can trade it for more than you paid for it,” he exclaimed in the video.

The YouTuber took advantage of the exploit — not valuing all the time he spent, of course — by traveling to several stores over two days, netting a profit of $150.

But it didn’t take long for GameStop to catch onto the “glitch” once it was publicized.

In a Tuesday statement, GameStop’s official X account admitted that “our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit.”

“Effective immediately, the glitch has been patched,” the statement reads. “Trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored.”

The company also used the opportunity to “gently remind everyone that our stores are not designed to function as infinite money printers.”

Speaking of free money, GameStop became embroiled in a major meme trading controversy in 2021 after a “Wall Street Bets” community on Reddit banded together to send the company’s stock value soaring — temporarily.

The “short squeeze,” a massive surge in short selling of a stock that ignores the company’s business fundamentals, triggered major losses for hedge funds and short sellers and forced brokerage services company Robinhood to step in and shut it down, attracting criticism from politicians.

A second attempt in 2024 crashed and burned. While those who got out at exactly the right moment made a killing, those who didn’t time things perfectly were left out to dry.

In comparison, buying and reselling Nintendo consoles seems like a far less risky bet.

            <h2>These Snapshots of the Moment a Star Exploded Will Fill You With Cosmic Dread</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A pair of incredible images taken at the very moment two different stars exploded are also an accurate representation of how our feeble minds are being melted at the awesome but terrifying cosmic forces on display.

The images, taken with multiple telescopes at the CHARA Array at Georgia State University, captures a stellar calamity known as a nova, in which the extremely dense remnant of a star that was once like our Sun, called a white dwarf, siphons material from its companion star orbiting dangerously near it, eventually causing a thermonuclear explosion that the white dwarf ultimately survives. The detonation arises once the stripped material — primarily hydrogen — accumulates on the white dwarf’s surface and reaches critical mass. Novas, in other words, are naturally occurring hydrogen bombs, releasing in mere moments the energy our star emits in roughly 100,000 years.

Despite lighting up the night sky, astronomers could only infer what happens at the early stages of these formidable blasts, as direct observations proved difficult, not least of all because the exploded material appeared as a single point of light impenetrable to finer probing. Now, the new images are allowing them a peek behind the curtain.

“These observations allow us to watch a stellar explosion in real time, something that is very complicated and has long been thought to be extremely challenging,” said Elias Aydi, lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, and a professor of physics and astronomy at Texas Tech University, in a statement about the work. “Instead of seeing just a simple flash of light, we’re now uncovering the true complexity of how these explosions unfold.”

The images were primarily taken using a technique known as interferometry, in which multiple sources of light are smashed together to create an interference pattern that astronomers can analyze. This is enabled by collecting data using telescope arrays like CHARA, which is made up of dozens of antennas spread across a large area that, when all trained on the same point in the sky, act as one massive telescope. The CHARA data was then furnished with imaging taken by other telescopes such as NASA’s Fermi telescope, a space lens that watches for high energy emissions known as gamma rays, and the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.

The work revealed that novas are far more complex than we give them credit for, and can’t be reduced to a single, destructive blast. One of the imaged novas, V1674 Herculis, proved to be one of the fastest novas on record, reaching peak luminosity before fading in just several days. It showed two distinct outflows of gas, suggesting that the explosion involved multiple powerful ejections of material that interacted with each other. But what was truly stunning was that these ejections emitted gamma rays which were detected by NASA’s Fermi, showing that the blasts are capable of producing some of the most energetic emissions in the cosmos that are typically associated with black hole-forming supernovas.

The other imaged nova, V1405 Cassiopeiae, seemed to unfold in spectacular slow motion, taking more than fifty days before finally ejecting all of its exploded material. Over the course of that nearly two month period, the white dwarf shrouded itself in a sphere of the stripped gas that eventually swallowed both stars, forming an extremely rare structure called a common envelope. Remarkably, when this envelope finally dispersed, the ejection produced its own blast of gamma rays that NASA’s Fermi was able to observe.

That both events produced detectable gamma rays shows that novas are “laboratories for extreme physics,” said coauthor Laura Chomiuk, a professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, in the statement, which could help us “connect the dots between the nuclear reactions on the star’s surface, the geometry of the ejected material and the high-energy radiation we detect from space.”

            <h2>China Has Screwed Up Really, Really Badly</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-21</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For many decades, the Chinese government attempted to limit population growth through a one-child policy — only to abolish the rule in 2016 as it realized that the number of annual births had started to plummet at alarming levels.

The aggressive policy — alongside other extreme measures — succeeded far too well, with birth rates dropping a staggering 17 percent between 2024 and 2025 to the lowest level since 1949. The country’s population is now actively shrinking each year, and it’s hard to imagine how the trend could be reversed.

The situation has gotten so dire that Beijing eliminated tax incentives on condoms, hormonal birth control, and other contraceptives, as Fortune reports. Basically, it’s now desperately trying to reverse itself out of a fertility crisis of its own doing. President Xi Jinping has practically been pleading with the country’s women to bear more children.

Yet fewer and fewer women thereare interested in raising a family, sending China well below the “replacement rate” of 2.1 children per woman, meaning the government’s interventions are doing little to address the issue. Many countries around the world, including most of North and South America, and Europe, are already experiencing below-replacement fertility rates. The situation playing out in China is a preview for what’s still to come in many other regions projected to experience a similar decline.

“The empirical evidence from other countries so far is that monetary incentives have almost no effect in raising fertility,” University of California professor of sociology Wang Feng told the New York Times.

Despite its economy growing by five percent last year, over 11 million people died while only 7.92 million babies were born. Meanwhile, a hot new app is trending in China that takes the form of a countdown timer that has to be reset regularly by single people so that their friends and family will know if they die alone.

The number of working-age people is also dropping as the population continues to age, further taxing healthcare systems and pension funds. The major drop in the fertility rate will continue to have devastating effects, shifting demographics that could result in a worsening economic outlook. The cost of raising a child in China is still extremely high compared to other countries.

“With China’s economic woes, young people may want to wait and see, and that’s not good news for raising fertility,” Wang told the NYT.

In short, whether taxes on contraceptives and Xi’s calls for a “new type of marriage and childbearing culture” will reverse China’s plummeting birthrate remains unclear at best.

The country’s population has been shrinking since 2022, and judging by the latest numbers, the trend is bound to continue. And as the population continues to age, hundreds of millions could soon be leaving the workforce — a demographic crisis and ticking time bomb in one.

            <h2>Blue Origin’s satellite internet network TeraWave will move data at 6Tbps</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/blue-origins-satellite-internet-network-terawave-will-move-data-at-6tbps/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin has just announced a satellite internet network called TeraWave which will be capable of offering data speeds up to 6Tbps, and geared towards enterprise, data center, and government customers.

The TeraWave constellation will use a mix of 5,280 satellites in low-Earth orbit and 128 in medium-Earth orbit, and Blue Origin plans to deploy the first ones in late 2027. It’s not immediately clear how long Blue Origin expects it will take to build out the whole network.

The low-Earth orbit satellites Blue Origin is building will use RF connectivity and have a max data transfer speed of of 144 Gbps, while the medium-Earth variety will use an optical link that can achieve the much higher 6Tbps speed. For reference, SpaceX’s Starlink currently maxes out at 400 Mbps — though it plans to launch upgraded satellites that will offer 1 Gbps data transfer in the future.

“TeraWave adds a space-based layer to your existing network infrastructure, providing connectivity to locations unreachable by traditional methods,” the new website for the satellite network reads.

The announcement of the TeraWave network comes just a few months after Bezos’ other company, Amazon, announced a rebrand of its own satellite network geared toward consumers. That network, called Leo, will ultimately consist of around 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit and offers more traditional broadband speeds.

Taken together, these two networks could provide more robust competition to SpaceX’s Starlink, which has become the leading satellite internet provider with more than 9 million customers. Starlink currently sells its connectivity to regular consumers, commercial customers (like airlines), and governments.

That said, the two networks from Amazon and Blue Origin are distinct.

“We identified an unmet need with customers who were seeking enterprise-grade internet access with higher speeds, symmetrical upload/download speeds, more redundancy, and rapid scalability for their networks. TeraWave solves for these problems,” Blue Origin said in a statement to TechCrunch.

Blue Origin has spent years in development on a number of projects, and is best-known for the short trips to space it offers on its small New Shepard rocket.

The company has recently started to emerge as a multi-faceted commercial space player. In 2025, the company successfully launched its mega-rocket, New Glenn, for the first time and then repeated the feat months later. It also landed the booster stage on just its second attempt, and launched its first commercial payload for NASA.

The company plans to send a robotic lander to the surface of the Moon this year on the third New Glenn launch. Now, with TeraWave, it will add “satellite manufacturer and operator” to its growing list of offerings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">U.S. autonomous drone delivery and logistics startup Zipline said Wednesday it will set up operations in Houston and Phoenix early this year, as part of an expansion that will be propelled by $600 million in fresh investment.

The round, which values the company at $7.6 billion, will be used to expand to at least four U.S. states in 2026, the company said. Several existing and new investors, including Fidelity Management & Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Valor Equity Partners and Tiger Global participated in the funding round.

Founded in 2014, Zipline developed its own drone delivery ecosystem, including the logistics software, launch and landing systems, and the aircraft. The company got its commercial start in 2016 using its autonomous drones to deliver blood in Rwanda. Today, Zipline’s drones deliver food, retail, agriculture, and health products in five African countries, several cities in the United States, and Japan.

Last year, Zipline launched a home delivery service in the U.S. that lets customers order food and retail goods via an app. The home delivery service uses Zipline’s Platform 2 drones, which are designed to carry up to eight pounds and travel to customers within a 10-mile radius. Its larger Platform 1 drones are used for long-range deliveries for enterprise, business and government that can cover 120 miles roundtrip. The P2 platform started in Pea Ridge, Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with Walmart, and more than a dozen restaurant brands, according to Zipline.

It has also announced plans to launch in Seattle. Other commercial partners include Panera, Chipotle, Crumbl, Blaze Pizza, Wendy’s, and Little Caesars.

That geographic expansion in the United States has fueled Zipline’s delivery numbers. In 2024, the company completed one million drone deliveries to customers; this week, Zipline said it had surpassed 2 million deliveries. The company also said its U.S. deliveries have grown by about 15% week over week for the last seven months.

Co-founder and CEO Keller Cliffton views 2026 as the company’s breakout year.

“Autonomous logistics has been maturing for more than a decade, and the last year has made it unmistakably clear that when deliveries are faster, cleaner, safer, and cheaper, demand isn’t just high, it grows exponentially,” Cliffton said in a statement. “In 2026 autonomous logistics will become an everyday staple for people across several states in the U.S. That transformation starts with Houston and my home town of Phoenix, which we’ll begin serving early this year, and then expand to even more places across the country throughout the year.”

Zipline isn’t alone in the nascent industry of drone delivery. Other competitors include Flytrex, DroneUp, Amazon Prime Air, and Wing, the Alphabet-owned subsidiary that has also partnered with Walmart. Wing announced plans to expand to another 150 Walmart stores through 2027.

            <div id="article-text">VCs who have backed OpenEvidence are apparently not worried about OpenAI and Anthropic’s new health information products.

On Wednesday, the startup announced that it raised an additional $250 million in Series D funding at a $12 billion valuation, co-led by Thrive Capital and DST.

That’s double the valuation from its last raise in October: $200 million at $6 billion, led by GV. It has now raised a total of $700 million, the company says, from backers including Sequoia, Nvidia, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Bond, Craft Ventures, Mayo Clinic, and others.

OpenEvidence is an AI-powered medical information platform, similar to what WebMD was for the previous internet generation, but it’s geared toward doctors. This puts it somewhat more in competition with Anthropic’s Claude for Healthcare, which is intended for patients, payers and providers, whereas ChatGPT’s new health product is aimed more at consumers.

The company says that the free, ad-supported platform served 18 million clinical consultations from verified healthcare professionals in the U.S. in December alone. That compares to about 3 million searches per month a year ago.  It also said that it had surpassed $100 million in revenue.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta on Wednesday announced it’s expanding ads on Threads to all users globally. The expansion, which starts next week, will be gradual, the company says, noting it may take months for the full rollout to complete.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly praised the social app and X rival, which has now grown to over 400 million monthly active users, as the company’s next big hit. Shortly after the app’s debut, the exec told investors that Threads had a good chance of reaching 1 billion users in a few years’ time.

The app has rapidly grown since its July 2023 debut, reaching 200 million users by mid-2024, 320 million as of January 2025, and then adding another 30 million as of last April, before reaching its latest milestone.

Though Threads hasn’t yet hit that milestone, the company has been testing ads for some time. A year ago, Threads began testing ads in the U.S. and Japan, and last April, the platform opened up to global advertisers.

The company has made it easy for existing advertisers to expand their reach to include Threads by allowing them to automatically place ads through both Meta’s Advantage+ program and via manual campaigns. Supported formats include image and video, ads, including the newer additions of the 4:5 aspect ratio format and carousel ads. Advertisers can manage their Threads ads alongside those for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in their Business Settings, which simplifies cross-posting.

In addition, Meta expanded the third-party verification already available on Facebook and Instagram (including feed and Reels) to the Threads feed through Meta Business Partners. This provides advertisers with independent brand safety and suitability verification for Threads — a useful feature when Threads’ nearest rival is dealing with a scourge of illegal deepfakes.

The company didn’t share how often users would see ads in their feed, but noted that ad delivery initially would remain “low” as the feature scaled to global users.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/youtube-tvs-multiview-is-getting-a-huge-upgrade-letting-viewers-mix-and-match-channels/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube TV has been slowly expanding its multiview feature over the past few years, which initially allowed sports fans to watch up to four channels simultaneously on one screen. Soon, viewers will finally have the chance to watch any content they choose.

​In his annual letter published on Wednesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that the platform will soon introduce a “fully customizable multiview” experience. This upgrade aims to provide greater personalization by letting viewers create their own multiview layouts, tailoring their screens to their individual interests across sports, news, entertainment, and more.

​YouTube TV first rolled out the multiview feature for sports broadcasts in 2023, allowing fans to watch multiple games simultaneously. The feature later expanded to include other categories, such as news and weather, though it was initially restricted to a set list of preselected channels, including CNN, MSNBC, HGTV, and Food Network. Later on, YouTube TV began testing a way for a small group of users to customize which channels they wanted to watch side by side without restriction.

This new capability is expected to appeal to families and larger households with diverse viewing preferences, as it allows different genres to be watched together on a single screen.

​To try out multiview, press the down button on your remote, then look for the Multiview icon or the “Watch Multiview” option, and select it. From there, you can pick up to three more live channels to add to your screen.

​Additionally, Mohan highlighted YouTube TV’s upcoming launch of genre-specific channel packages, designed to give subscribers more flexibility over what content they pay for. For example, viewers can choose specialized packages focused on sports, news, family programming, or entertainment, tailoring their subscriptions to their interests and potentially saving on costs.

However, YouTube TV hasn’t shared much about these packages, like how much they’ll cost or when they’ll launch. We can likely expect more information to be announced in the coming months as the platform prepares for rollout.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a new generation, 2016 is now known as “the last good year.”

Since the new year, Instagram has been taken over by a 2016-themed “add yours” sticker, which prompts users to post throwback photos from 2016. Users have posted more than 5.2 million responses, creating enough buzz to spill over onto other platforms. On Spotify, user-generated “2016” playlists have increased 790% since the new year, and the company now boasts in its Instagram bio that it’s “romanticizing 2016 again.”

In fairness, 2016 does seem like a simpler time. Donald Trump had not yet served a day in the White House, no one knew the difference between an N-95 and a KN-95 mask, and Twitter was still called Twitter. It was the year of “Pokémon Go Summer.”

But as often happens, the nostalgia skims over a lot of the anxiety that was already palpable at the time. When meme librarian Amanda Brennan searched her archives for the images that defined 2016, she showed me a screenshot that surprised me, given the internet’s current obsession with the year. The post reads, “Can’t believe that the devil put all of his energy into 2016,” with another user adding, “It’s like he had an assignment due January 1, 2017 and forgot until now.”

I forgot how much everyone hated 2016 at the time. It was the year of Brexit, the culmination of the Syrian Civil War, the Zika virus, and the Pulse Nightclub shooting, to name a just a few sources of dread. It wasn’t just the polarizing election of Donald Trump — months before that night, a Slate columnist sincerely posed the question of how bad 2016 was when compared with notoriously awful years like 1348, when the Black Death took hold, or 1943, the height of the Holocaust.

The start of a new year is fertile grounds for nostalgia. The internet thrives on this kind of engagement bait, to the point that Facebook, Snapchat, and even the built-in Apple Photos app constantly remind us what we were doing a year ago.

This time around, though, our nostalgia feels different, and it’s not just political. As AI increasingly encroaches on everything we do on the internet, 2016 also represents a moment before The Algorithm™ took over, when “enshitification” had not yet reached the point of no return.

To better understand the state of the internet in 2016, Brennan suggests viewing it as the ten year anniversary of 2006, when the social internet definitively cemented itself in our lives.

“In 2006, technology changed. Twitter was launched, Google bought YouTube, Facebook started allowing anyone above 13 to register,” Brennan told TechCrunch.

Before social platforms, the internet was a place for people who looked online for a sense of community — people who were “for lack of a better term, nerdy,” as Brennan puts it. But when social media took off, the internet began leaking, and the barrier between pop culture and internet culture began to erode.

“By 2016, you will see that ten years of time has let people evolve, and people who necessarily were not internet nerds to begin with maybe ended up on 4chan, and all of these smaller little places where previously, they had been made of internet people, versus people who are not as online,” she said. “But also, because of phones, everyone is kind of an internet person now.”

By Brennan’s estimation, it makes sense that 2016 was the year that Pepe the Frog — once an amiable stoner from a webcomic — was corrupted into a hate symbol, and the misogyny that fueled Gamergate showed up on the national political stage. (Meanwhile, left-leaning meme groups sparred internally about whether or not the “dat boi” meme — an image of a frog riding a unicycle — had appropriated African American Vernacular English.)

At the time, it felt novel to point out how internet culture had begun informing our political reality. Within another decade, we had a pseudo-government-agency named after a meme, which — to name just one of its many atrocities — cut international aid funding and led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people.

Another ten years later, we’ve now had a full two decades to reckon with how the social internet has shaped us. But for people who were children in 2016, the year still holds a certain mystique. Google worked well. It was relatively easy to spot deepfakes. Teachers didn’t have to funnel all of their limited resources into determining if a student copy-pasted their homework from ChatGPT. Dating apps still held promise. There weren’t that many videos on Instagram. “Hamilton” was cool.

It’s a rosy view of an online era that had its own mess of problems, yet it aligns with a larger movement toward a more analog lifestyle — it’s the same phenomenon that precipitated the resurgence of in-person matchmaking events and point-and-shoot digital cameras. Social media has become so central to our lives that it’s not fun anymore, and people want to go back to a time before anyone had ever uttered the word “doomscrolling.” Who could blame them?

            <h2>Trump Seems Determined to Alienate His Allies</h2>

“Without us, right now you’d all be speaking German,” Donald Trump scolded European leaders at the World Economic Forum this morning. Perhaps the Germans have a word for the experience of watching your country’s leader embarrass himself and the country on the global stage.

Where does one start in summarizing such a speech? The straightforward racism? The economic illiteracy? The determination to alienate allies? The many moments where the president said things that were blatantly, provably false? And because he rambled through more than an hour, he covered a lot of ground.

The most anticipated section was about Trump’s ongoing effort to acquire Greenland. Trump argued that only the United States could defend the island, which he perplexingly also dismissed as “a giant piece of ice” and accidentally called “Iceland” on a few occasions. He also said Greenland was essential for the “golden dome” missile-defense system he claims he will build. (He denied that the U.S. is after rare-earth minerals in Greenland.)

Although Trump insisted that he has the utmost respect for both Danes and Greenlanders, nothing else he said evinced any. He accused them of being ungrateful for the U.S. defense of Greenland during World War II and argued that the American government erred when it “gave it back” after the war. Trump delivered a classic mafioso threat to take Greenland by force, saying that U.S. military might was irresistible, before adding nonchalantly that he would not do such a thing. This was not as reassuring as some headlines might lead readers to believe. And he said that if European leaders didn’t acquiesce, “we will remember.”

More broadly, he assailed NATO, saying that the U.S. had spent heavily on the alliance and gotten nothing in return. Although Trump’s push to get NATO countries to spend more on defense has been successful, he still does not grasp that NATO is an expression of American might, not a drain on it. The group has made much of Europe into vassal states that have supported and extended American foreign policy around the globe. Trump also repeatedly said he doubted that the NATO allies would aid the U.S. if called to do so. This statement must come as a surprise to the many members who supported the United States after 9/11—the only time in history that NATO’s mutual-defense clause has been invoked. (My colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker reported last week on the Danish soldiers who died in Afghanistan.)

Trump seemed determined to alienate allies. He mockingly imitated French President Emmanuel Macron’s accent. He took a swipe at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. He ridiculed the United Kingdom as too incompetent to extract oil from the North Sea. “Sitting on one of the greatest energy sources in the world, and they don’t use it,” he said. But he continued his administration’s outreach to Europe’s far right, blasting immigration to the continent. “Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable, frankly, anymore—they’re not recognizable, and we can argue about it, but there’s no argument,” he said. He claimed that prosperity and progress in Europe and North America were a result of a shared culture that was incompatible with immigration. (Never mind that Trump seems eager to demolish the pillars of cooperation between the U.S. and Europe.)

But Trump’s speech also had a domestic audience; in the lead-up, the White House insisted that his aim was to talk about affordability, which is fast becoming the “infrastructure week” of the second Trump term: frequently promised, never delivered. Trump did meander through some talk of the economy, though his explanations were often too circuitous or false to be very persuasive. Like his predecessor Joe Biden, whom he repeatedly insulted during the speech, he hasn’t figured out how to validate voters’ dim view of the economy without taking blame for it. He celebrated oil drilling (while lying about gas prices); he flogged his plan to cap credit-card interest rates (which Republican congressmen have criticized); he bragged about killing clean energy (while falsely claiming that China does not use wind farms). Most of all, he defended his use of tariffs (which raise costs for American consumers) and complained about trade deficits. Like Trump’s skewed understanding of NATO, this obsession fails to grasp that trade deficits are evidence of America’s massive wealth, not a sign of weakness. His efforts to reduce them, though, are likely to isolate the U.S. and sap that wealth.

Naturally, the president didn’t stay on message. Trump also announced (without offering details) that he would soon prosecute people for a supposedly “rigged” 2020 election. He reprised a racist riff from yesterday’s White House press conference about Somalis having low IQs, and he called Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali immigrant and Minnesota Democrat, a “fake congressperson.”

After all of this, the president abruptly delivered a boilerplate conclusion about unity and cooperation among nations. This kind of swerve is baffling unless you’ve spent a lot of time watching Trump campaign rallies, in which case it’s very familiar. Trump has no interest in calibrating his tone or approach to different audiences. This can make his speeches painful to watch, but it may also be illuminating in this case. Global leaders in politics and finance who otherwise wouldn’t spend their time watching full Trump stump speeches got the stump speech to come to them—providing a good reminder of exactly who the president is.</div>

            <h2>The Great Crime Decline Is Happening All Across the Country</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-21</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last summer, a protester in Seattle made an anti-police sign with an unusual message. Hey SPD, it read. Crime is down 20 percent, and you had nothing to do with it.

The taunt was glib, but it hinted at a profound question about the nature of public safety in American cities. After a pandemic-era rise in murders commonly attributed to a lack of policing, Seattle recorded fewer homicides in 2025 than in 2019, despite a much-smaller police force. If less policing made crime go up following the George Floyd protests—and most people thought it did—then what has made it go down?

What happened in Seattle is happening even more dramatically across the country, as America experiences a once-in-a-lifetime improvement in public safety despite a police-staffing crisis. In August, the FBI released its final data for 2024, which showed that America’s violent-crime rate fell to its lowest level since 1969, led by a nearly 15 percent decrease in homicide—the steepest annual drop ever recorded.

Preliminary 2025 numbers look even better. The crime analyst Jeff Asher has concluded that the national murder rate through October 2025 fell by almost 20 percent—and all other major crimes declined as well. The post-pandemic crime wave has receded, and then some. According to Asher’s analysis, Detroit, San Francisco, Chicago, Newark, and a handful of other big cities recorded their lowest murder rates since the 1950s and ’60s. “Our cities are as safe as they’ve ever been in the history of the country,” Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at Princeton who studies urban violence, told me.

Few experts endorse the idea that the police “had nothing to do with it,” as the Seattle protester claimed, but the link between the number of cops and the number of crimes seems hazier than ever. The low point in violent crime has arrived even though large police departments employed 6 percent fewer officers going into 2025 than they did at the beginning of 2020, according to a survey by the Police Executive Research Forum. Though they were mostly not in fact defunded, police forces were rocked by retirements and departures. New Orleans lost nearly a quarter of its officers in the years after the pandemic—and then recorded its lowest homicide rate since the 1970s in 2025. Philadelphia had its lowest per-capita police staffing since 1985—and just clocked its lowest murder rate since 1966.

There are many plausible explanations for the recent crime downturn: sharper policing strategy, more police overtime, low unemployment, the lure of digital life, the post-pandemic return to normalcy. Each of these surely played a role. But only one theory can match the decline in its scope and scale: that the massive, post-pandemic investment in local governments deployed during the Biden administration, particularly through the American Rescue Plan Act, delivered a huge boost to the infrastructure and services of American communities—including those that suffered most from violent crime. That spending may be responsible for our current pax urbana.

Naturally, every local leader likes to say that their police department is making the difference. But in this case, every happy family is not alike: Police staffing and strategy vary widely from place to place, so an exceptional local police chief can hardly explain gains that are so widespread. “What has changed nationally is a huge investment by the federal government in prevention in response to the COVID epidemic,” John Roman, a criminal-justice researcher who heads NORC’s Center on Public Safety and Justice at the University of Chicago, told me. He credits ARPA with sending billions to local governments to use as they saw fit, and defines prevention in the broadest possible sense. “Investing in education, police, librarians, community centers, social workers, local nonprofits. Local-government employment rolls increased almost perfectly inverse to the crime rate.”

One of the most impressive turnarounds has occurred in Baltimore, which has cut homicides by almost 60 percent in the past five years, bringing the murder rate close to a 50-year low. That comes despite a historically understaffed Baltimore Police Department. “In our heyday we had 3,100 police officers, and in 2015, we had 3,000. Now we have 2,080,” the city’s police commissioner, Richard Worley, told me. “We’re still 500 officers short of where we’re supposed to be.”

Mayor Brandon Scott, who has presided over the decline in violence, praises the police but notes that police alone can be neither credited nor blamed for crime trends. “The difference of approach here is, I do not and the city does not subscribe to the thinking that only the women and men of the Baltimore Police Department are responsible for reducing violence in our city,” he told me.

City leaders and observers alike have celebrated Baltimore’s new Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, which received $37 million in ARPA money from the city and works with police, schools, hospitals, and nonprofits. “ARPA allowed Mayor Scott to build out a brand-new agency that didn’t exist before,” Stefanie Mavronis, who directs the office, told me. “We knew it was a one-time investment, and we had to demonstrate to the Baltimore public that we should be funding this.”

Mavronis’s office supervises the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy, which conducts direct outreach to a narrow band of people caught in the cycle of retaliatory killings. People it identifies as likely to perpetrate crimes receive letters from Mayor Scott, offering access to city services. He has sent 450 of these “custom notifications,” and 336 people have taken him up on the offer. My colleague Toluse Olorunnipa wrote about that program in September. A University of Pennsylvania study credited the GVRS with reducing homicides and nonfatal shootings in the city’s dangerous Western District by a quarter.

That approach is one of scores of alternative public-safety ideas that were funded through ARPA. Cook County, home of Chicago and the nation’s second-largest county, put roughly $36 million into efforts such as Healing Hurt People Chicago, a trauma-recovery program for crime victims. Mecklenburg County, home of Charlotte, North Carolina, used ARPA to fund a “youth peace summit” and advertise a gun-lock-distribution program. Some ARPA money also bolstered police and sheriff’s departments directly.

All that funding combined, however, represents just a small slice of the local-government stimulus delivered through the bill. According to a National League of Cities database that covers $65 billion in local ARPA grants to 19,000 projects, public safety made up less than 9 percent of the investment—less money than was spent on traditional public health, housing, infrastructure, community aid, or government operations.

Baltimore is a case in point: The explicit violence-prevention work at GVRS ($37 million) gets a lot of attention, but the city spent nearly twice that amount in federal dollars on public space and parks ($67 million) and $192 million on housing. Baltimore spent nearly $15 million hiring community members “to clean and maintain public spaces in historically disinvested neighborhoods.” The city’s renaissance, the mayor says, is not just about a new approach to public safety—it’s also about building new swimming pools and creating summer jobs for teenagers. Summer jobs for teens, blight reduction, and green spaces have all been linked to lower crime rates. Nationally, the largest category of ARPA spending, according to the NLC database, was in “government operations”—funding local services and putting people back to work.

The idea that widespread public stimulus could cause crime to fall might mesh with a theory of its COVID-era rise put forth by researchers at the Brookings Institution. Violence may have been amplified by post–George Floyd policing changes, Rohit Acharya and Rhett Morris suggest, but it was rooted in school closures and job loss. “Cities where more teen boys and young men were pushed out of school and out of work in low-income neighborhoods during March and April [of 2020], generally had greater increases in murder from May to December,” they conclude.

ARPA (and its little brother, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) also helped police departments be more effective in their work, in spite or even because of their staffing challenges. Memphis Mayor Paul Young says his city has used technology, nonprofit partnerships, and an ARPA-launched group-violence reduction initiative to help supplement a police force that had its lowest staffing in 20 years in 2025, letting police focus on police work. The result: Murders, assaults, robberies, and carjackings all fell by more than 20 percent last year. (That decline was under way well before President Trump deployed the National Guard, the mayor notes.)

Another possibility is that trust is finally improving between local police and the people they serve. In Baltimore, Commissioner Worley said, the force has experienced a culture change since the federal consent decree imposed after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray. “We went from a warrior mentality to a guardian mentality,” he said, noting that crime-stopper tips went up 32 percent from 2024 to 2025—a sign that more Baltimoreans trust the police. And the police, in turn, are solving a lot more crimes than they used to. Staffing isn’t everything.

Jill Leovy: America is having a showboater moment

Other factors may have contributed, but cannot explain the magnitude of the shift on their own. The Trump administration claimed last summer that crime had fallen thanks to its pursuit of “violent criminal illegal aliens,” though that does nothing to explain the record-setting numbers from 2024. Society may be healing from the pandemic—reflected in falling rates of overdoses, suicides, and traffic accidents—but that doesn’t answer why Americans are less likely to get killed now than before we all learned what an N95 was. Digital entertainment may be keeping kids off the streets, but social media has also accelerated deadly disputes. Technology may be solving crimes, but even established policing tech sometimes turns out not to matter in crime prevention.

The public likely has an easier time understanding the direct and highly visible role that police play in deterrence and arrests, in contrast to the hidden work of anti-violence nonprofits, to say nothing of the more diffuse benefits of a blight-reduction fund or a new HVAC system at the library. “Mayors are always going to credit the quality of their police for doing good work and lowering crime,” Matt Tuerk, the mayor of Allentown, Pennsylvania, told me—after, of course, crediting the quality of his police for doing good work and lowering crime. Tuerk says that Allentown has seen homicides fall from 17 in 2023 to four in 2024 and five in 2025, the lowest numbers since the 1980s. “But there are so many factors that influence those crime statistics—parademic-response time, jobs programs, conflict-resolution techniques at violence-interrupter organizations, investments in neighborhood conditions. A thousand fathers for that victory of crime reduction.”

These hypotheses are about to be put to a test. Police staffing is recovering in many cities, and police funding remains as much a political priority as ever, but the last of the ARPA grants will be spent this year, forcing cities to make choices about which programs to fund and which to eliminate. Many “alternative” public-safety grants have already been cut by the Trump administration, leaving recipients such as schools and community organizations in the lurch. It’s as if the national gravity pulling down crime rates will suddenly evaporate, Roman, at the University of Chicago, suggested, revealing the weight of local choices. Baltimore is working on a post-ARPA plan to make sure its public-health approach to policing can be supported by the city’s general fund, but not every investment of the Biden years can be sustained.

For now, the new, less violent moment means relief and opportunity for the country’s most dangerous neighborhoods. “When violence falls, city life opens up, and the most disadvantaged communities benefit the most,” Sharkey said. “There is new investment, families take part in public life, kids are allowed to be out in parks. It just changes the nature of city life in a fundamental way.” But the calm is precarious. To keep it, we will have to figure out what made it possible in the first place.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum examines one of the most consequential deceptions of the Trump presidency: the insistence that grocery prices are falling when Americans know from lived experience that they are not. David explains how tariffs and trade policy are deliberately driving food costs higher, why Trump keeps lying about it, and how breaking this promise strikes at the core of the fragile trust between voters and government.

Then David is joined by Fiona Hill, a former adviser to three U.S. presidents and a key witness in Trump’s first impeachment, to analyze how Vladimir Putin sees the world and why Trump remains so drawn to strongman power. Frum and Hill discuss Putin’s long game in Ukraine, Trump’s archaic and backward worldview, and how Trump’s presidency has been a gift to Putin while steadily eroding American credibility abroad.

Finally, David closes the episode with a discussion of Among the Believers, by V. S. Naipaul, reflecting on the Iranian Revolution and why authoritarian regimes repeatedly fail at modernity.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Fiona Hill, an adviser to three American presidents on Russia and Eurasia generally, and of course a central figure in exposing President [Donald] Trump’s wrongdoing that led to the 2019 first impeachment of President Trump.

My book this week will be a 1981 travelogue by the great writer V. S. Naipaul, Among the Believers, which took him to, among other countries, Iran in the immediate aftershock of the Iranian Revolution of 1979.

Before I get to the dialogue and the book, I wanna open with some preliminary thoughts about a domestic subject. And that is this extraordinary moment where Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins informed a TV interviewer that her department had run thousands of simulations, and good news, it was possible to feed an American person for less than $3 if that person ate a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, a corn tortilla, and one other thing. She didn’t have enough respect either for her audience or for the people she was talking about to remember what that fourth thing was that would make up this kind of snack plate. And this has attracted a lot of question marks: What if you want a second corn tortilla? And by the way, with chicken selling even at Walmart for between 25 and 30 cents an ounce, how big a piece of chicken is that piece of chicken going to be for under $3?

But aside from the “let them eat cake” aspect of this, one of the things that is really striking has been the refusal of the Trump administration even to acknowledge that there is a food-affordability problem in the United States. President Trump has responded to the increases in the price of food, the general price increase under his presidency, by simply lying about it. I’ve got a little summary here—I don’t pretend this is an exhaustive summary. Here he is on October 21: “Grocery prices are way down.” Here he is on October 16:. “Groceries are down.” Here he is on October 14: “Now, as you know, groceries are down.” October 10: “We’ve gotten prices way down for groceries.” At the United Nations [on] September 23: “Under my leadership … grocery prices are down.” I’m sure there are many other instances. On January 13, President Trump addressed the Detroit Economic Club, and there, he spoke from a script, so there was a little bit more effort to make the words not a complete lie. And his quote on January 13 was: “Grocery prices are starting to go rapidly down.” (Laughs.)

Now, grocery prices are up, up, up. Data released in the week that I record this program by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found the cost of food at home rose 2.4 percent overall in the 12 months of 2025 and 0.7 percent in December alone, the fastest single-month increase since October of 2022. And the rise in food prices stands out because many other prices are ceasing to go up so fast. Gasoline, rent, other similar prices, the worst of the inflation for them seems to have at least taken a little pause in December, but grocery prices continue to grow. And many individual food items are up astonishingly high: the price of beef, up 16.4 percent; the price of coffee, almost 20 percent; price of lettuce, other fresh produce, the price of frozen fish, again, up. The one exception to all of this is the one price that the Trump people love to talk about, and that is the price of eggs. Those are down. But across the board, grocery prices are way up.

And this is not, as it was under [President Joe] Biden, just a product of a general price inflation affecting the whole world. Many of the price increases have been driven very deliberately upward by particular policies. Price of a can of beans is up because the price of the can is up, and the price of the can is up because the metals in the can have been hit by tariffs by President Trump. You put a tax on aluminum and steel, you make cans more expensive, and if you make a can more expensive, the thing in the can becomes more expensive, whether it’s beans, whether it’s soda. Trump threatened to put a 92 percent tariff on Italian pasta. He backed away from that threat a little bit in January, but pasta is still tariffed, and the Canadian wheat that goes into American-made pasta, that’s also tariffed.

So this was done deliberately and on purpose—and without a lot of regard for the fate of the people on the other end. This could be dealt with by a different kind of president by some argument that it’s worth it: Yes, you’re all going to have to pay more for food, but that is on the way to my vision of self-sufficiency through tariffs. We’ll seal off the United States economy in the world, and even though you’ll all pay more and maybe be a little poorer, at least you’ll have less trade with foreigners. But the Trump people are just systematically incapable of dealing with trade-offs and telling the truth. And they’re especially dishonest about the distributional effect. When you put food prices up, not everybody pays equally. The richer you are, the smaller proportion of your income you spend on food and the less you notice the price at the grocery. But the people who are in the middle or in the lower part of the income distribution, they feel it most, and they are many of the people who trusted Donald Trump to help them because through campaign 2024, he promised that that would be his first priority—not just that he would stop, right, prices from going up, but that he would make them go down.

Now, Trump lies about a lot of things, and a lot of the things that he lies about are things that it’s difficult for people to check, or maybe they just seem too abstract to check: Our economy is the hottest in the world. How do you prove that right or wrong? But the people who decide elections, they know what everything in the grocery basket costs, and they know that the president is lying to them again and again and again. And that has an impact on their faith [in] him personally and directly—it has an effect on the political calculus. But it has an effect generally on the way politics works.

The Americans who turned to Donald Trump were those most distrustful of the political system, most inclined to believe that the political system is indifferent to them, deceitful to them, and they put special and unique trust in this one person, whom they regarded, falsely, but whom they regarded, trustingly, as a great business leader, to tell them the truth and to deliver them relief. When he breaks his word to them, of course, he breaks the special political bond that he once had, and you can see that in all the polls that show him down, down, down, and especially down on economic issues. But it’s an attack on their faith in the general political system because if this one unique figure that they were willing to trust, if he too is deceptive, then what is there? It raises the question, again, of how we go on from here and how we restore the relationship of trust between the American people, their government, and the president who leads the government and symbolizes the government. If he’s not a person [you] can trust, how can anything be trusted?

It’s a haunting and difficult question, one probably that won’t be resolved so fast, but a question that is going to dominate our politics for the three remaining years of the Trump presidency and through this election year of 2026, when people will once again get a chance to say, We resent these prices. We resent the deliberate policy to make the prices go up. We resent being lied to. We want something different. We want a change.

Frum: Fiona Hill has served three presidents as a deep expert on Russian affairs and Eurasia broadly. Born in the United Kingdom, educated at Harvard and St. Andrews University in Scotland, she is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and chancellor of Durham University in Great Britain. In 2021, she published a memoir, There Is Nothing for You Here, about her upbringing in England’s former coal country.

Fiona Hill is best known for her courageous integrity during and honest testimony about President Trump’s attempt to extort Ukraine for his personal political advantage in his first presidential term. In this moment of global crisis, I am one of many who turns to Fiona Hill for insight and guidance. Fiona, thank you so much for joining me today.

Fiona Hill: Thanks so much, David. It’s really great to be with you.

Frum: So let’s start by looking at the world from the other side of the board, from [Russian president] Vladimir Putin’s point of view. You have spent a lot of time thinking about how he thinks, what he’s thinking about, the way he’s different and surprising from an American point of view. How does the world look to him? Ukraine, a pending crisis in NATO, but he’s taken some blows in Iran and Venezuela—how does the world map look from his point of view?

Hill: Well, David, it’s good that you pointed out those negative aspects of some of the recent changes for Putin from the start, thinking about those blows, as you put it, I think very aptly, in Iran and Venezuela, two countries which have very close relationships with Putin and Russia, which I’m sure we’ll get to in the course of our discussion. But if you put some of those downsides, again, on the shelf for the moment, until we get back to them, if you took it at just face value, the world would look pretty propitious from Putin’s point of view. Because you mentioned in your introduction Trump’s efforts to extort, as you put it, President [Volodymyr] Zelensky of Ukraine in the run-up to that first impeachment trial, and Putin’s all in the business of extortion, basically using all kinds of manipulation or force, bullying, you name it, to get what he wants. And he wants a world in which might makes right, in which it’s a battle for, basically, spheres of influence by strongmen, and on the surface, that seems to be where we are.

If we look back to the first Trump administration in 2016 and then, of course, the whole period with Biden, things look much more ambiguous from Putin’s point of view. He wasn’t really quite sure what the trajectory was going to be. He wasn’t sure what the direction of travel was going to be. But he was certainly hoping that he would be able to take advantage of circumstances and to push Russia’s advantage.

You may remember that he also tried to bully Biden in 2021—it seems so far away now that none of us can really remember it—when he basically put the United States on notice that if Russia doesn’t get what it wants in terms of the United States pulling out of Europe, pulling back from Ukraine, taking NATO back to the studs, back to the borders, which it was in before its expansionary phase in the late 1990s, then Putin was gonna do something extreme, which, of course, turned out to be the full-on invasion of Ukraine in the February of 2022.

And so Putin has been pushing for advantage that whole period. And so from his point of view, if you look at it, it now looks like we are in a world where sphere of influences and strongmen and transactional relationships are shaping the environment.

Frum: As you and I speak, we have troops from NATO countries—including, of course, Denmark, but some of its Scandinavian partners, France, the U.K.—on their way to Greenland. How big a win is that for Putin?

Hill: (Laughs.) It’s enormous. And the posited reasoning for the United States of wanting to acquire Greenland—and again, this does actually go back, again, to the first Trump administration, 2019—but the posited reasoning is really acute pressure from Russia and China. And we’ve also had President Xi Jinping of China saying, We’re not interested in Greenland, not on us, and Putin also having never actually made any kind of claims against Greenland. So this is really something that is a fairly absurd development from everybody’s point of view. But for Putin, obviously, this is potentially a bonanza.

But this is where kind of a flip side of uncertainty might come into this because, as you’re saying, who are the troops? Perhaps not in the large-enough numbers—actually, if I was the Europeans, I’d be sending even more in. And what we’re seeing here is Europeans having to stake out their interests in the name of their security, but it’s in reaction to the United States, not just in reaction to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, and that brings, I would say, a bit more uncertainty for Putin just along the lines of the blows that he’s already had in Iran and Venezuela.

Frum: Well, let’s look at the Ukraine map from his point of view. The war, as a military matter, has gone catastrophically badly for him. As I am told, at least the post–February ’22 conflict has now lasted longer than the Soviet involvement in World War II—they started late, of course. And the toll in life and money is overwhelming. But he is maintaining his position on the ground, and he’s got an American administration that seems to conceptualize a peace treaty as finding out what Putin wants and giving it to him at the expense of the Ukrainians.

Hill: That’s absolutely right. And this is where Trump’s return to the White House has been a real boon for Vladimir Putin, because he is now operating in a world which is, for Putin, a very easy one to navigate in the sense of you’ve got global leaders—and he only really counts as global leaders Xi and Trump—who have the same sort of mindset of wanting to go and return to that 19th-century or even 18th-century, certainly early-20th-century, view of transactional relationships among the big powers, with everything defined, really, by politics at the top, not this kind of mass politics that came in much later. So Putin’s very comfortable in that environment.

But as you’ve pointed out, Ukraine was a catastrophic blunder. He did this full-on invasion in Ukraine not expecting it to be all the things that you’ve described. This wasn’t intended to be the largest military action in Europe since World War II. It certainly wasn’t intended to last longer than the Soviet Union was battling Nazi Germany, which that’s the threshold, as you point out, we just passed this month. That is just remarkable. It was supposed to be a “special military operation.” In many respects, it was supposed to be something along the lines of what the Trump administration just pulled off in Venezuela, a decapitation, thinking that they would remove Zelensky, and they’d probably get, in fact, what the United States government is angling to get in Venezuela, a pliable alternative leader, who might have actually come out of the same system, and it would be business as usual for them, not basically new forms of business for Ukraine. So it’s been an absolute disaster.

But the point is that Putin is something of what one might call a survivalist and a prepper. He’s basically been building up resources. He’s been thinking long and hard about what it takes for Russia to be more resilient, even though it is quite brittle in terms of its political system and in terms of what we see unfolding there in Ukraine—you can’t keep this up forever. But Putin has marshaled resources and all the capabilities of Russia to the point— heavily militarized the economy, heavily militarized the whole system—he has this vertical of power that enables him to do all kinds of things that other leaders cannot, even Trump. You can’t really sue Vladimir Putin as you can, currently, still sue the United States government. But his bet is that, because of these changes in international circumstances, especially because of the incumbent in the White House, that he will be able to last everyone else out. He will have the ability to, basically, press this to a final conclusion that, despite all the losses, all the incredibly high costs—and he is ruthless, and he’s prepared to pay that price—everybody else will fold. That’s his bet.

Frum: I think of [Lord] Farquaad in Shrek: Some of you may die, but that is a price that I am willing to pay.

Hill: (Laughs.) Yes, in fact, that’s a great analogy. And all kind—

Frum: Also a very small leader. (Laughs.)

Hill: (Laughs.) Exactly. Probably about the size of Vladimir Putin, in fact, and always on a horse.

Frum: (Laughs.) How bad is the news for him from Venezuela and from Iran?

Hill: Well, it depends, right? Everything always depends. And this is what Putin is very good at: He’s got strategic patience. Everybody talks about now—it’s become a complete cliché, but it certainly wasn’t 20-odd years ago, when people were trying to understand Vladimir Putin. Remember, he’s actually quite predictable now. We’ve got 25 years of data points from a man that we knew very little about, that Masha Gessen called “the man without a face.” We now know his face. (Laughs.) We know about his family. We know all kinds of different things about him that we did not know before. And what we also know is that he bides his time.

If you think about Yevgeny Prigozhin, who, a couple of years ago, we thought, Oh my God, is it all gonna teeter? He’s getting this backlash from the war in Ukraine. He’s got an insurgency. There’s a man marching on Moscow. Could this be it? Could this be a coup? And there wasn’t a lot of support for Putin. But of course, that fizzled out. And it’s many months before Yevgeny Prigozhin meets his demise by literally falling from the greatest window in the sky, as people have a tendency to do in Russia—meeting mysterious and unfortunate deaths. And that’s the end of all of that.

So what Putin is waiting for right now is to see if, in many respects, those escapades in both Iran and Venezuela, which look extraordinarily harmful from all the vested interest that they have, in particular, in Venezuela in terms of oil, sending in security forces to prop up [Venezuelan President Nicolás] Maduro. Iran’s support for a whole matter and manner of different issues for Russia, from actually helping them counteract Sunni Muslim insurgents in the country, ’cause, of course, Iran is Shia; to helping produce that first batch of drones that Russia has used against Ukraine, to pretty good effect as well, the Shahed drones; to being that other great kind of power in the region. Their hope, I think, now is that everything else goes kind of haywire, that it doesn’t follow those trajectories that everyone might anticipate—Iran, the theocracy, doesn’t fall, because that would bring all kinds of uncertainty and actually not a good look for Putin—and that, as we’re already seeing in the case of Venezuela, Maduro is just being replaced by his deputy. So for Putin, that’s actually not that bad, so he will wait to see how this plays out. It’s like a judo tournament for him: You wait ’til everybody else is off-balance. You just kind of wait, and you figure out what the opponent is gonna be; you don’t just leap in there. Again, that’s his expertise in judo. You just wait until you can leverage everybody else’s strength against them.

Frum: And he’s got, once again, the help of his friend, the president of the United States, who in both countries, Venezuela and Iran, really seems to have betrayed any ideal of democracy. In Venezuela, he seems to have made it very clear that he wants the next thug in line. This is not regime change; it’s dictator rotation. In Iran, the president promised the Iranian people that help was on the way. As you and I speak, that promise seems to have been utterly empty and not honored, and people have died in the thousands and maybe the tens of thousands believing the word of the United States, a mistake. It’s such a shame and a sorrow even to think that the word of an American president could be so worthless, but there it is. So Putin is going to get maybe some second-bests, thanks to Donald Trump.

Hill: And that’s good enough for him because you can rack up a lot of second-bests; then you win a tournament. The whole point for Putin is staying in the game and kind of waiting out his opponents and seeing if he can outfox them over time. Again, he’s pretty predictable in this. And he knows that Donald Trump’s word is empty—let’s just be frank—because the one thing that Putin is extraordinarily good at is figuring people out: figuring out their vulnerabilities, figuring out their weaknesses. He’s less good at figuring out people’s strengths because he doesn’t believe that anybody’s altruistic. He doesn’t really believe that anybody would do something for goals that are not venal or not personalized, for example, so Trump fits his category of the person that he’s used to dealing with perfectly. There are people like the pope, the current pope, who I think Trump would have a more difficult time of dealing with—Putin would, rather. Did I say Trump? I might have said Trump. (Laughs.) But anyway, Trump might also have a difficult—

Hill: —with the current pope as well. But Putin—anybody who actually stands for something that’s different and actually looks like they actually mean it and is not trying to achieve something that Putin can actually get his hands on and try to manipulate it, that is more difficult for him. But right now Trump is playing to form. It’s the form that Putin expects. And I’m pretty sure that Putin, perhaps misplaced, in any case feels very confident that he can manage everything that’s happening. But I say that could be misplaced, but it’s not for the reasons of Trump suddenly getting religion, to use this kind of metaphor and pull it out a bit further.

Frum: One last question from Putin’s side of the playing board. You mentioned a couple of times that Putin thinks in terms of power. But when he thinks in terms of power, he thinks in terms of military power, espionage power, maybe natural-resource power; he doesn’t seem to have a very sophisticated grasp of the way economies work. And so one of the things that has happened since February of ’22 is that Russia’s slide toward becoming a Chinese economic colony does seem to have accelerated, and if he emerges from this Ukraine war, even with a seeming military success—with a change in the borders, or a friendlier regime in Ukraine, or withdrawal of American support from Ukraine or Poland or the Baltics—he still has the problem that it’s China who pays his bills. And—

Frum: —does he think about things like that?

Hill: I’m sure he does, because he certainly had plenty of warnings in the past. But I think, at this point—and again, it seems that this is the trajectory that he’s on—he’s not really thinking of a period when peace breaks out. He’s become a wartime president, and I think he feels that he can keep a wartime economy ticking along for quite some time and maybe put off, then, the kinds of problems that he will inevitably face.

We’re seeing all kinds of problems in the U.S. economy, and the U.S. economy is immensely resilient because of the structure of it, the nature of it. And the Russian economy is resilient in some similar but very different ways, more related to autarky and just the vastness of its natural resources. But that, of course, makes it very difficult to marshal them and to move into those value-added chains that we expect in a more sophisticated economy. And Russia had been moving in that direction up until the full-on invasion of Ukraine, but it was quite difficult because its economic model was running out of steam. And the war has injected a new head of steam into it.

Now, the one thing that Putin clearly doesn’t care about is human capital. And that is also very interesting ’cause you wouldn’t, in that regard—and this is why I think President Trump just doesn’t get Putin at all: He cannot understand why you would slaughter all of these people that you actually need to make your economy work. Even with a miraculous shift to AI, you’re still gonna need people. And that’s what Putin has done: He has squandered the future of his human capital. A lot of people are working, admittedly, offshore, particularly in the Gulf and other places, and still contributing to the Russian economy. But you look down the line and that idea of economic recovery, that idea of innovation that’s not just related to defense and to innovation on the battlefield, that’s one of the areas that Putin has likely squandered. And of course, he’s completely eroded trust. And although other countries look to Russia right now and still want to factor them in as a great power, they no longer think of Russia as a superpower, and they absolutely, certainly do not think of Russia as a technical, innovative, economic superpower. And as you said, it’s much [more] likely to end up being some kind of appendage of China at the end of all of this, even more so than it already is.

Frum: Yeah, when you mentioned Putin’s belief in “might makes right,” one of the most striking legacies of his rule is going to be the definitive end of Russia as a mighty state. It may overpower Ukraine; it can certainly scare Estonia. But if you think—and you used to do this kind of work—if you project the world of 2036, 10 years from now, we’ll have two superpowers: the United States and China. We’ll have a number of countries that are economically very important, but not militarily strong: India; the European Union, if you think of that as a power player; possibly Japan; possibly Britain. Where’s Russia? Maybe there with Japan and Britain as countries of some economic power because of their natural resources, some military power, but nothing like an India, let alone a China or the United States, in the way that Putin imagined he might be when he started the Ukraine war.

Hill: Yeah, and actually, Russia was on, before this—and, in fact, before seizing Crimea, which I think was the moment where Putin shifted the trajectory of his presidency—Russia was up there in the larger economic powers. There was a whole goal of being not just in the G7 or the G8, but being one of the top five or six global economic powers, and at one point, that looked like that might be possible. But as you’re saying, that’s not likely to be where Russia is, although shifts in its trade patterns still, the commodities, that might bring something. But I think that the world is gonna be a very complex place if I look out to 2036.

I think we’re squandering ourselves, the United States, some of those fundamental bases of power, which you’ve been pointing out in many of your podcasts and other things that you’ve been writing and with your colleagues in The Atlantic. I think that we’re gonna look more at much more regional bases of power. But of course, the United States is still gonna have the ability to shape things in the world, and China is increasingly gonna have more ability, particularly in terms of technology, research, education, all kinds of innovation, to shape the way that everybody else responds. But I wouldn’t rule out India, Brazil, even South Africa, which the United States seems to be in a fight in at the moment, and European countries, perhaps not in the EU configuration, but there’s just been such a jolt to Europe that we shouldn’t rule out some constellation of European countries, maybe in Northern Europe—Scandinavians, the Balts, the Poles, and others—actually really stepping up there in response to what’s happening, especially what’s happening in Greenland, and becoming a much more military place. Finland is significant as a military. We’ve still got Turkey as a major military power. So things could change quite a lot in this next decade.

Frum: Well, the most dramatic slap in the face, and I can’t quite do this math in the head while I’m talking live, but as I sort of pull up what I recall of the figures and just do a quick calculation, we’re not very far away from Poland overtaking Russia in the size of its economy.

Hill: Yes, and Poland is spending about 5 percent now of its GDP on its—

Frum: Yeah, this puts Russia back to where it was in the 1600s, when Poland was the stronger, at least economically. Let me ask you—

Hill: Well, and remember the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was actually Europe’s biggest country and most significant for that period up until when you’re talking about.

Frum: Let me ask you now to change the lens back to Washington. There has always been this strange, mysterious, difficult-to-explain, but unmistakable-to-observe affinity that Trump has had for Putin. And that does seem to continue, that the big Trump idea for ending the war in Ukraine is to cut off the flow of information, reduce the flow of supplies to Ukraine, and put pressure on them to yield to Russia’s terms. Do you have any sense of why, not just Trump, but [special envoy] Steve Witkoff and people around him, think that that’s such a good idea?

Hill: It’s how they think about power and the manifestation of power. They don’t think about “we the people,” as in you, I, and, what is it, 340 million people who live in the United States or the 140 million and declining in Russia. They don’t think anybody has agency apart from big guys and—usually men, of course. And if there are no checks and balances, and you have unfettered power, then that is kind of the epitome of might and might makes right. As Trump himself has said over and over again, most recently in The New York Times lengthy interview, he sees no constraint apart from his own. And that’s how they see Putin, and indeed, Putin has whittled away all of the checks and balances in his system. He seems to be at this pinnacle of this vertical of power and to be unchecked, unconstrained in every way imaginable, and so for them, he’s the guy to deal with. Steve Witkoff and Trump, as real estate moguls, they’d go to the guy who was in charge and then get their guys on lower levels to deal with things from there.

And it’s really the kind of power that Trump has. I remember in Trump 1.0, the former U.S. ambassador to Hungary, who was a good friend of Trump’s—he was a jeweler from New York and had known him for many, many, years. And he was talking about [Hungarian Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán. And in fact, I think it was an interview in The Atlantic, of all things, in which he said, This is what Trump wants. It’s what Donald Trump wants. He wants to be that kind of leader. And in many respects, that means that’s what Putin’s got on him, because he knows that Trump needs his respect, his validation. And I saw that over and over again in Trump 1.0, where Trump would want to call Putin ’cause Putin had said something nice about him on international television or he’d want to talk directly to him, and of course, those discussions are mediated for Trump—and for Witkoff as well. They don’t speak Russian, so it’s always through a translator. They hear what’s being presented to them. They don’t get the sense of the man and how he’s making fun of them and what he really thinks. So this is always problematic. They see what they want to see, which is their own validation in Vladimir Putin. And Vladimir Putin sees that, and he just gives them what they want.

Frum: Is it all about that kind of petty vanity?

Hill: Of course. That’s at the root of things. I’m sorry; it’s just from years of observation of this. Putin knows exactly how to do it. I and many others who study kind of Russia, we’ve all been subjected to this.

There’s a famous episode of Putin helping a Russian politician who there’s no reason why he would help him, and I was related this story by the politician himself, who was done a pretty significant favor by Putin. And this person has actually told this story publicly, but when we asked him why, and he said Putin said to him, when he’d asked the same question, Well, you never know who you might turn out to be or when I might need something from you.

Putin plays to vanities, he plays to vulnerabilities, he plays into times of need because he never knows when he might need something. And they act in the same way—Witkoff, Trump, they’re all kind of birds of a similar feather. But unfortunately, they’re not quite as good at this as Vladimir Putin, because he’s had years of training and honing these skills as a KGB agent, and 25 years of being president of Russia in a pretty vicious political environment.

Frum: It’s like the opening scene of The Godfather: One day, and that day may never come, I will ask a service of you in return.

Hill: Exactly right, exactly right. And the thing is, they all think in similar frames because of where they operated: real estate. It couldn’t be any more similar to the kinds of environments in which Putin operates in. But the thing is, Putin thinks of himself as the head of a state of a state with millennia of history. He talks of himself in that regard. He’s got an idea about being cloaked in the mantle of the power of the state and the church. He sees himself as the heir to all kinds of emperors and even empresses, with Catherine the Great. Trump thinks of just himself. And if he’s thinking of American heroes, it’s just as he defines them, not as they might define him.

Frum: Well, one of the things, if you say it’s about vanity, that is disquieting about all this—there are, of course, all these theories, and I never pretend to know if any of them are true or if none of them are true. There are theories that there is compromise. There are theories that there is bribery. There are theories that Trump is looking forward to some future payoff. And I must say, as contemptible as all of those things would be, they’re somehow less pathetic than he’s looking for compliments. But when you see Trump in the Oval Office with someone else’s Nobel Prize in his greedy little hands, with a smile on his face as if the stolen cup of apple juice tastes just as good as the cup of apple juice that was intended for you, it occurs to you, Yeah, maybe it’s just as dumb and pathetic and cringey and embarrassing as that: that he just loves the compliments.

Hill: It is cringey, and I felt like that many, many times when I was in his presence with world leaders. I would cringe because he was also making himself incredibly obvious. And that’s what Putin is: He’s the master of, obviously, domineering and dominating people. He’s the master of seeing the obvious, but he’s also the master of digging a bit deeper.

Now, in terms of compromising material, we’ve all got all kinds of information on Trump and the enrichment of him and his family. Meme coins—it’s all in plain sight. What more do we need to know about? We’ve got the [Jeffrey] Epstein files and all the scandals about all of that at the moment. Putin doesn’t need any of that. I remember once saying to one of the Russian ambassadors, ’cause I was supposed to be, obviously, giving them the kind of equivalent of démarche about interference in the United States elections, and he ran off a whole host of different things that different people, Americans, had done and said, Can you blame us for that, Miss Hill? And I thought, Got me. Of course not, because we do plenty of things ourselves that actually lay ourselves open to this kind of manipulation, all the mistakes that we make that turn out to be fateful, and we can’t blame Russia for everything here.

Frum: It’s not a question of blaming them—

Frum: —it’s a question of punishing them.

Hill: —but we’re blaming them for finding information and for using that, because, again, we’re producing plenty of these scandalous episodes and problems ourselves, and they just know how to use them. So I’m just saying that I’ve never been really convinced that Putin had something that was so off the charts in terms of its radioactivity that it could bring Trump down, because so many other things have failed to do so.

Frum: Why can’t Trump see that Putin is less powerful than he was three years ago?

Hill: I think it’s because of his frame from the Cold War in the 1980s. I think it’s still that idea. He’s said it many times in relationship to Ukraine, that Russia is just a big power. He thinks of it just as Putin does.

Frum: But it’s not. That’s the thing I find baffling. The Soviet Union certainly was, and in the first decade of Putin’s reign, Russia looked that way, whether it was or not, but it doesn’t look that way now.

Hill: Yes, but it does to Trump because he doesn’t really listen to the assessments of you, me, or anyone else on this score. For him, it’s the size of a country. So we’re getting back to what we were talking about before: Why does he want Greenland? Because it’s 2 percent bigger, 10,000 square miles bigger, than the Louisiana Purchase. So it would be the biggest real-estate deal in history. Who’s got the biggest real estate in the world? It’s Vladimir Putin. He’s been sort of described as the richest man in the world by everybody from Elon Musk, who clearly is, not Vladimir Putin—he’s not going to cash out and kind of run around the world behaving like a tech mogul. But everybody thinks of this still in terms of just its size and the weight of it on the world stage.

Frum: And the animosity to Ukraine and Zelensky, is that personal? Is that a grudge about 2019 and Zelensky not doing what Trump wanted for the election? Is there something more going on there that—

Frum: It seems to be a real antipathy. And in [Vice President J. D.] Vance’s case, I get that it’s ideology. Vance wants to bring far-right powers to rule in Europe, and Zelensky’s success would validate the liberal parties. But Trump, it just seems very—what is it?

Hill: It’s those things that you’ve laid out, completely, but I think there’s also another edge to it that gets back to what we’ve just talked about. I think he’s envious, in some respects, about Zelensky, though he would never, ever say that, because Zelensky’s got all the accolades, rightly so, of being a real wartime president, of being somebody who didn’t back down in the face of attempts to push him out. He’s also a small guy, and Trump thinks it a small country, though, in territorial size, Ukraine isn’t a small country. And he’s somebody who has been given the wartime mantle of a Winston Churchill. And Trump hates that. It’s just like [Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina] Machado getting the Nobel [Peace] Prize. And Zelensky just hasn’t backed down, and Zelensky’s had the temerity to take him on, on a number of occasions, to push back. He hates that.

Frum: I know talking in the way I’m about to talk would get me thrown out of a National Security Council meeting for moralism and so on. But is there an issue just that Trump is wicked and cowardly, and he hates people who are good and brave?

Hill: Yeah, look, that’s a cartoon version of it, but obviously, one would kind of say, yes, in some cases, that is the case, but not in all cases, because there are some times when he does express admiration for something that somebody’s done, but it doesn’t necessarily directly affect him. I think that’s kind of the problem, is when somebody takes something that he thinks is his: a Nobel Peace Prize, the attention of the world as a wartime president or somebody who’s at the statue of Winston Churchill, kind of literally—and then he was soured on Churchill for a while when everyone kept comparing Zelensky to Churchill. So I think it comes into that frame in which his own personal validation is at stake. But I think that he can admire other people ’cause I’ve seen that. He isn’t a cartoon character. He’s complicated and complex, even as a—

Frum: Who have you seen him admire? Who have you seen him admire who deserves admiration?

Hill: I was sort of thinking that it’s often people who are not necessarily kind of world figures, somebody who has actually even done something unspeakably good for people, somebody who’s been really brave. He’s often kind of put himself out there for some of the hostages, not just to get accolades for bringing them back. There have been times when he’s done something that won’t necessarily give him popular acclaim all the time, and look, there are a couple of issues that I think he has to be given some credit for. He’s not the kind of person who wants to preside over mass slaughter, even though it might look like it at times when we see what’s happening currently in the country. But he is appalled by what the Iranians are doing. He’s appalled by what Putin’s doing. He was appalled by what [Syrian President Bashar al-]Assad did, and he wanted to do something kind of about it. He’s not somebody who wants to have the charnel houses filled with mountains of skulls; that’s not him.

The other thing is that he genuinely wants to see an end to the risk of nuclear war, nuclear Armageddon, just as Biden did—they’re the same age group. He’s been pretty consistent on this. He really did want to finish off the efforts that were started in the 1980s. And this is what’s ironic at the moment because, of course, we’re in a bit of a pickle because the New START treaty has now lapsed. But he really did want to have those big arms-control, arms-negotiation talks, not just with Russia, as the former Soviet Union, but also with China, with Iran, with North Korea. He does actually want to make the world a safer place from a nuclear perspective. And I feel that’s the tragedy, because he perhaps could have done something to that if he’d been more disciplined and more focused and less worried about whether he was going to get all kinds of accolades for it. That was what he was trying to do in Helsinki, back before that disastrous press conference and his first proper meeting with Putin. I think it’s a genuine sentiment on his part.

Frum: So that does de-cartoonify things. So you can give him that.

Hill: Absolutely. Look, and you still get lots of people saying, Look, he’s warm. He’s charismatic. I’ve seen flashes of that. But that’s not sufficient, in my view, to normalize a person (Laughs.) who is doing an enormous amount of damage. And the other thing is that, just like Putin, he’s a pattern breaker, but he’s even more of a pattern breaker than Putin, which actually means he does, obviously, see all of the problems that we’re facing. He’s identified them all, I think, extremely well. He’s broken the pattern. But he’s just not somebody who, beyond real estate, is actually really building something. And because his tendency is towards dividing everyone and conquering them—again, like Putin—and he’s not bringing people together to do things, which perhaps he could have done. So I think it’s almost Shakespearean for me, as though you have the hero, or the person who’s the hero in their own telling of the tale, but their own flaws prevent them from doing the things that they actually think that they want to do and for actually addressing the issues that they have correctly identified as being the key ones.

Frum: Yeah. So it’s part of his self-image—he would like to be a peacemaker if it just didn’t require so much reading.

Hill: Yeah, well, it requires patience (Laughs.) and some strategic thinking. It requires working with others and not short-circuiting the process, which is what he often does and declares peace when it hasn’t actually happened, which then enables the people like Putin and others to come back around again and take advantage of the situation.

Frum: That seems to be what’s happening in Iran as you and I speak, that he made a promise he didn’t mean to keep; the promise became embarrassing, so he declared that the killing had stopped when it obviously had not stopped.

Hill: Right. Look, and we can list all the different places where that has particularly happened. We all know that creating and building peace is very difficult—that’s why we call it “building.” And it’s not the same as building a wonderful tower or kind of a real-estate portfolio. There’s so many other elements of it. And again, Trump’s view, getting back to where we started from, is dealing with just a group of guys and then thinking that everything gets done from that direction. I think he does believe that Rome can be built in a day.

Frum: Last topic area and then I’ll let you go with thanks for your generosity with your time: Nothing lasts forever, and while Trump speaks of wanting a third term, that will be difficult, even assuming his health permits, which is another question mark. In whatever a post-Trump world means, it’s pretty clear that Russia has put some deep grip on the American political right. Trump’s next in line is even more anti-Ukraine than Trump himself. And there are all kinds of influencers and others in the Trump orbit or the pro-Trump world who have received all kinds of benefits from the Russians, and their propaganda messages do seem to shape a lot of the dialogue on the right-hand side of the spectrum. Do you think that outlasts Trump? Is that a phenomenon of Trump’s special affinity for Russia, or have they discovered some technology to influencing right-of-center parties in the United States and Europe?

Hill: Well, it’s definitely the feature of technology—I think that’s absolutely right—and just all the constant innovations that we have in technology that make it much easier to propagate information, and to get the same ideas seeded on larger and larger groups of people than they could have done previously. But in terms of the form of this, we could have said the same about the American and the European left during the Soviet period. You might—

Hill: And we did, exactly. So there you go, right?

Hill: It was true, exactly. But what was going on there was, in many respects, there were, as was termed at the time, fellow travelers. Sometimes they intersected, but they were all developing their ideas in parallel, and what, really, was useful to the Soviets at the time was that all of these groups were thinking the same way, and that’s, I think, what we’re seeing again now. We’ve moved around to the views of the right are now in parallel with the views of Russia and of other states, and I think it just makes it easy to become fellow travelers, and sometimes they get on not just on the same bus, but right in the seat next to each other. And of course, that did not completely fade away, because you still see the ties that come out of the old French Communist Party and Italy, for example, and in eastern Germany that still bond with Russia on the left, even though Russia is very much over here on the right, although we all talk about that horseshoe in which the politics have bent around.

So it’s not, I think, self-evident that this will continue post-Trump, but I think it’s now shaped very much these politics of the future. And the real challenge will be how to find a way back again to some central or other definition of our politics in which this trend is neutralized, just as is what happened over time in Europe and in America on the left.

Frum: And this phenomenon seems to be as advanced, if not even more so, in Europe and England than it is here.

Hill: Well, I don’t think it’s more advanced than here, but I think that the United States is playing a role in advancing that.

Frum: In advancing these kinds of pro-Russian, far-right, authoritarian—

Hill: People like [British politician] Nigel Farage and others have had to kind of repudiate their links with Russia in the current European environment, but Farage and GB News, of course, are just joined at the hip with Truth Social. Farage is very much driven by his relationship with Trump. And so it’s been quite difficult. You’ve had their head of reform from Wales in jail from actually accepting money from the Russians.

Frum: Reform is the new right-of-center party that is overtaking the Conservatives in support in the United Kingdom.

Hill: Correct, the U.K. Independence Party successor, with Nigel Farage at the top, shifting from pushing for Brexit, for the U.K.’s removal from the European Union, now using immigration. And now they’re trying to also pick up the same sets of issues that has been shaped here in the United States rather than in Russia, per se.

But we’ve seen funding from Russians. We’re now seeing quite a lot of efforts from the United States. And ironically, it’s both the U.S. and Russia that are shaping a lot of the thinking of these right-wing movements and parties, as you said, in the U.K. and in Europe. At the same time, you’re getting quite a lot of popular and political revulsion to not just what Russia is doing in Ukraine, but what the United States is doing with Greenland, etc. So I think this is gonna be pretty messy.

Frum: Yeah. Last question—then I’ll let you go. The czarist regime looked enormously strong until it unexpectedly collapsed. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union looked terrifyingly strong until it abruptly collapsed. Do you see any possibility of a similar kind of collapse of Putinist power?

Hill: Sure. We’re only one step away from all kinds of uncertainty with his health as well. And as Bill Burns said some time ago, former head of the CIA, unfortunately, he seems extremely healthy. (Laughs.) He’s had his health scares, like most of us do, but he’s in his 70s now; he’s heading towards his mid-70s. He was born in October 1952, so he’s not quite 75 yet, but this year, he’s 74. You don’t know how long people are going to continue with all of their faculties. Trump, of course, turns 80 this year. So anything where Putin looks like he might be losing his grip, any singular disaster within the Russian economy or something else that is a major setback—look how fragile things appeared to be when Yevgeny Prigozhin started his march on Moscow. We don’t know what could trigger things off; it’s all about events.

There is a great deal of uncertainty here in this current geopolitical climate, as you’ve already laid out, and the economy isn’t doing as well as it [was]. What if the Europeans suddenly get a backbone and a spine? What if there’s a change of heart or a change of government here in the United States? What if President Xi of China suddenly starts to feel that maybe this close association with Russia is not benefiting in the way that they thought, and they might need to nudge Putin and Russia in a different direction? I think it’s gonna be very hard for Putin to contemplate peace, for all of the reasons that we talked about before; he’s purely now a wartime president. He came into office against the backdrop of the war in Chechnya in 2000 as a wartime president. It’s been the hallmark of his presidencies for 25 years. He could have done something different, but there’s still kind of all of that risk, because he’s chosen war over peace, that things could go wrong.

Frum: Fiona Hill, thank you so much for your insights and for your service.

Hill: Thank you so much, David. Great to be with you.

Frum: Thanks so much to Fiona Hill for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As I mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is a travelogue by the great novelist and essayist V. S. Naipaul. The book is Among the Believers, published in 1981. It’s V. S. Naipaul’s account of journeys through Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the years 1979 and 1980—that is, in the immediate aftermath of the Iranian Revolution that has now misgoverned Iran and has come to such bloody spasms in the days and weeks just past.

Naipaul wanted to understand how it was that a country that’s seemingly on its way to modernization, as Iran had been in the 1970s—Iran under the Shah [Mohammad] Reza Pahlavi had been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world—how a country seemingly fast-forwarding toward modernization could have taken the giant step backward that it took with the Iranian Revolution. He interviewed people in the city of Qom, which is the center of the Ayatollah [Ruhollah] Khomeini’s, the first supreme leader of Iran’s, religious power. And he interviewed everyday, ordinary people as well.

There’s no big moment of reveal in these encounters; they’re very everyday. They’re very perceptive—he is a brilliant novelist, and he can make a character come to life with a few strokes of a pen. But he did have one guiding insight that he repeats a couple of times in the course of his visit to Iran in 1979 and ’80 and this travelogue in 1981, and it’s really worth thinking about today as we try to understand how the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and ’80 went so disastrously wrong in every way for the people of Iran.

Naipaul’s observation was that the new religious leadership of Iran, although they took a step backward in terms of human rights, women’s rights, human autonomy, they did not want to give up the good things—the tools of power. I shouldn’t say the good things; they were prepared to get rid of music. But they didn’t wanna give up the instrumentalities of wealth and power of the modern world. They didn’t wanna stop the oil from being pumped by modern oil-pumping technology. They didn’t wanna give up buying weapons and surveillance technology. They wanted all of those things. And he was baffled as to how people who turned their back on the culture and civilization that could produce these good things still wanted and still believed they could wield these instrumentalities. And he discusses this at two or three points in the course of the book, and let me quote just a couple of them here as guides to Naipaul’s thinking.

One of the things about Naipaul’s career as a writer, I should say, was he was a famously kind of dyspeptic and even misanthropic person, without any kind of regard for the niceties of human existence. That made him a very difficult person to be around, and those people who knew him have all kinds of harsh stories (Laughs.) about how difficult it could be to know him. But it also meant that he was utterly free from cant and euphemism in a way that will maybe seem a little startling in the world of 2026, when cant and euphemism surround us so often.

He described the affinity of the revolutionary groups in Iran for these Western technologies. He says, and I’m quoting the beginning of a sentence here, Western—that’s not in the quote—Western, and here the quote begins, “technology surrounded us in Tehran, and some of it had been so Islamized or put to such good Islamic use that its foreign origin seemed of no account. The hotel taxi driver could be helped through the evening traffic jams by the Quranic readings on his car radio; and when we got back to the hotel there would be mullahs on television. Certain modern goods and tools—cars, radios, television—were necessary; their possession was part of a proper Islamic pride. But these things were considered neutral; they were not associated with any particular faith or civilization; they were thought of as the stock of some great universal bazaar.”

And as he gets to the end of his trip, he returns to this observation, and this time, he turns it into kind of the conclusion or the thesis of his whole section of the book—I won’t discuss the parts on the other countries—but the whole section of his book on Iran under the ayatollahs. He describes the Ayatollah Khomeini, the maker of the revolution, as self-perceiving himself as an interpreter, and this is [where the] quote begins, “interpreter of God’s will, leader of the faithful, he expressed all the confusion of his people and made it appear like glory, like the familiar faith: the confusion of a people of high medieval culture awakening to oil and money, a sense of power and violation, and a knowledge of [a] great encircling civilization. That civilization couldn’t be mastered. It was to be rejected; at the same time, it was to be depended [on].”

Now, in the years since 1981, it’s become apparent that these tools of technological power can be developed by societies that reject Western ideals of freedom and individuality. China is, for all practical purposes, a technological peer of the Western world without absorbing, or preserving, many of these Western ideals of individuality and freedom and autonomy. So it can be done. But in the core of the Islamic world, and especially in Iran, it was not done. And Naipaul challenges us to think, Why not? Why couldn’t the Islamic Republic achieve what China achieved: some kind of self-sustaining capacity to run a modern state in an effective way? They had the oil. They had the money. Yes, they had extreme plans of aggression. They poured hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars of wealth into building the kind of empire of aggression aimed at Israel, but also at other states in the region. They built an empire that reached, at one point, all the way to the Mediterranean, all the way to Afghanistan, and they paid a lot of money for that. But they were never able to develop, despite the extraordinary skills of Iranian hackers that we see of Iranian computer culture, any kind of properly functioning technological economic system. Something went terribly wrong, and that has been the trigger for this revolution. Because for Iran, maybe unlike China, that encircling world, you’re either in it, or you’re not in it. And one of the messages of the tumults we have seen in Iran is that people, even people who maybe reject some of the values of the Western world, they want its benefits.

That project of getting the benefits of Western civilization without its freedom and rights, that’s one that has vexed tyrants all over the world. Some of them have somewhat succeeded, like the Chinese. The Iranians, like the Russians, have failed. And that failure is having enormous political consequences. And all of us who watch these horrible events in Iran from afar have to wish this brave and courageous people every success on their way to rediscovering, reclaiming what should be theirs. And we who have watched this also have to deal with the feelings of terrible shame that the United States made such promises to them through the mouth of its president, promises that, at least as I record, have not been honored and that have led many to tragic and perhaps unnecessary and avoidable deaths.

            <h2>Trump Can Prosecute Anyone Now</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-21</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A year into Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Justice has become his private law firm, devoted less to the impartial administration of justice than to blackmailing, intimidating, and persecuting Trump’s foes while selectively enforcing the law to spare allies who break it. The chairman of the Federal Reserve reveals that the Justice Department has been attempting to blackmail him into lowering interest rates with the threat of a federal indictment. The governor of Minnesota, the mayor of Minneapolis, the former head of the FBI, the attorney general of New York, and a member of the Federal Reserve Board all face indictment or investigation for opposing or challenging the president.

The decision to ignore evidence that demands investigation or prosecution can be equally nefarious, as we’ve seen in Minneapolis, where federal authorities refused to investigate a masked government agent for shooting an unarmed mom in the face, and where half a dozen federal prosecutors have since resigned after being pushed to investigate the woman’s widow instead.

These are all examples of the executive branch abusing its prosecutorial discretion. And thanks to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court, Trump is likely to get away with it.

The Supreme Court’s 2024 decision to grant presidents “absolute immunity” to criminal prosecution for “official acts”—a concept with no textual basis whatsoever in the Constitution—means that Trump can abuse his authority over the executive branch with impunity. Given Trump’s campaign-trail emphasis on “retribution,” he probably would have pursued malicious prosecutions of his enemies regardless of the Court’s decision. But the Court’s grant of imperial immunity eliminated any fear Trump might have had about criminal liability for the corrupt use of his powers.

The argument for the independence of the Justice Department is straightforward. Although the president may set priorities, actual cases are supposed to be brought based on the facts and the law, not on the identity of the defendant. “Attorneys general have differed a lot; John Ashcroft was not Eric Holder,” Michael Bromwich, who was a DOJ inspector general in the 1990s, told me. And yet, he said, attorneys general have all believed “in a Justice Department where law-enforcement decisions were made on the facts and the law.” Independence is “the only thing that can give the country the belief that decisions that can ruin people’s lives are being made fairly by people who are weighing the evidence” instead of according to a “political agenda or a personal vendetta,” Todd Peterson, a law professor at George Washington University, told me.

You cannot have impartial prosecution without prosecutors who make decisions free of political pressure. But what if you don’t want impartial prosecutions? What if you want to prosecute a grieving widow whose wife was killed by a federal agent, because you see her as a political enemy?

Here, as in many other cases, Trump is something of an authoritarian innovator; legal experts told me that the prohibition on the president directing specific prosecutions or investigations has always been more a norm than a requirement. But it was the kind of norm that was rarely broken. “There have obviously been moments in our history where various different administrations have pushed their ability to influence the Department of Justice,” Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor and a law professor at New York Law School, told me. But since Watergate, she said, “every attorney general who has assumed the role has, during their confirmation hearings, reiterated the importance of the independence of the Department of Justice.”

When Richard Nixon declared that “when the president does it, it is not illegal,” it was a scandal, but a faction of the conservative legal movement saw it as an ideal. Over time, more and more conservatives have pushed for an interpretation of the Constitution in which the president—at least if he’s a Republican—does not merely set policy or enforcement priorities, but can also personally direct any and all criminal or civil investigations. Anything less, they argue, would be an unconstitutional encroachment on executive-branch prerogatives.

One of the crucial barriers to using this power corruptly was the fact that, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in “Federalist No. 69,” the president could “be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.” Until Trump, this was the consensus view—that’s why President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon after the latter’s resignation. If anyone had actually thought that Nixon was immune, it wouldn’t have been necessary. It’s also why President Bill Clinton agreed to suspend his law license in a non-prosecution agreement with the federal government before he left office. Trump has also menaced his predecessors, which makes clear he thinks immunity belongs not to the office but to himself, personally.

Criminal liability, however, would have interfered with Trump’s return to office, and luckily for him, right-wing justices rewrote the Constitution to exclude it. In the Court’s 2024 ruling, the majority declared that Trump has full immunity to criminal investigation in the conduct of his official duty as president, shutting down the inquiry into his attempts to seize power by force after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden—including Trump trying to use threats of prosecution to compel states to give Trump their electoral votes through the use of fraudulent electors. The “allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. Theoretically, Trump could still be prosecuted on the grounds that parts of his scheme were not “official acts,” but with the current Court composition, that’s about as likely as him naming Kamala Harris his vice president and then resigning.

Therefore, even corrupt uses of prosecutorial authority by the president—such as, say, trying to blackmail the chairman of the Federal Reserve—would be kosher. “When Trump says, Article II lets me do whatever I want, that’s exactly how he hears what the Court has said,” Peter Shane, a law professor at NYU, told me. “And it’s very hard, given the Court’s wording, to explain to him, No, that’s wrong.”

In the abstract, the Roberts Court’s argument may seem compelling; in practice, it is absurd. We can now see what its grant of immunity has produced: an attorney general who is little more than a mob lawyer, a Justice Department that is little more than a corrupt law firm with one client, and an entire legal system subsumed by the whims of a president who can spare his friends and persecute his enemies.

We don’t have to wonder whether Trump has compromised the Justice Department’s independence; we know he has, because he’s been very loud about it. In September, for example, he complained on Truth Social that Attorney General Pam Bondi had not yet indicted Senator Adam Schiff or New York Attorney General Letitia James. A subtler authoritarian, Roiphe pointed out, might try to keep his lawless directives secret.

“Imagine a president who campaigned on I’m gonna respect the independence of the Department of Justice, and then subsequently behind the scenes started pulling strings,” Roiphe said. “It’s not clear that the public would ever know that this was going on. The only reason why we are so aware of this is because President Trump has just not been even remotely shy about the fact that he’s doing this.” Indeed, The New York Times reported last Tuesday that the week before Powell’s revelation, Trump had told “dozens” of U.S. attorneys that “they were too weak, and needed to step up the pace of investigations of his enemies.”

Even the most fanatical devotees of executive power seem to understand that this abuse of presidential power is inherently corrupting, and some have sought to downplay its implications. Bill Barr, who was U.S. attorney general during the first Trump administration, reportedly threatened to resign in 2020 over Trump’s remarks regarding Justice Department investigations. “It’s very important that the attorney general make sure that there’s no political influence at stake involved,” he told NPR at the time. Barr—in Big Lebowski terms—at least had an ethos. The current attorney general, Pam Bondi, does not.

Thus far, the only obstacles to Trump’s attempts to prosecute his enemies have come from outside the executive branch—from juries that have refused to indict or convict, and from courts that have maintained proper legal procedure, even as Trump officials have flouted it. The judiciary can set its own ethical guidelines and standards, which is why Trump’s political prosecutions have come up against roadblocks in court. But under the logic of the Supreme Court’s ruling, it would be unconstitutional for Congress to, say, pass a law putting restrictions on the executive branch to ensure the independence of the Justice Department. You would need some kind of constitutional amendment for that.

Under the new conservative consensus on presidential power, Trump is welcome to refuse to  investigate when government agents shoot Americans in the face, and he is welcome to try to charge their loved ones with crimes. He can openly blackmail government officials to manipulate the economy or to silence political opposition. No one can stop him from directing the Justice Department to indict his enemies for non-crimes while ignoring or pardoning the actual crimes of his political allies. He is free to be a tyrant, because the boss is the boss. But to me, it seems unlikely that the founding generation, in rebelling against a monarch, was looking to replace him with an even more wretched class of despot.</div>

            <h2>The Secret to One of Hollywood’s Most Enduring Friendships</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/the-rip-netflix-movie-review-matt-damon-ben-affleck-friendship/685687/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here’s a good rule of thumb for making a movie: Don’t allow the press tour to be the most exciting component. The Rip, from the director Joe Carnahan, is a cop drama where macho guys (and gals) tote carbine rifles and grunt law-enforcement lingo—the kind of crime-genre pablum that commonly gets thrown onto Netflix in mid-January. But this one comes with a ridiculously stacked cast, including, most important, its two leads: Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. The longtime Hollywood pals have dutifully hit the promotional circuit to talk up their latest collaboration, as well as argue over who’s the bigger New England Patriots fan, reminisce on their former shared bank account, and generally remind everyone about the wholesome endurance of their creative bond.

But none of that cheerfulness or easy friend chemistry can be found in the film they’re plugging. Damon and Affleck have acted together on-screen numerous times, but this is their first time sharing the top billing since Dogma, their 1999 dark comedy about a pair of fallen angels. The hiatus makes The Rip the kind of nostalgia-inducing star vehicle that should pique viewers’ curiosity—which is why its seeming disinterest in the leads’ personal connection is so bizarre. Affleck plays the Miami Police Department detective J. D. Byrne, and Damon is his superior, Lieutenant Dane Dumars. Byrne and Dumars get drawn into a conspiracy surrounding a colossal stash of illicit money, which is coveted by cartel leaders and crooked cops alike. Carnahan, however, seems more interested in depicting realistic police procedure than in letting the famous friends have much fun together.

That The Rip is such a bland venue for its charismatic stars’ reunion is a terrible shame. They do look the part, sporting big beards and close-cropped hair; their brows are eternally furrowed and their eyes are constantly narrowed as their characters try to sniff out each other’s loyalty and the loyalty of other teammates drawn in by “the rip” (the $20 million they’ve just discovered). If this film had been made in the ’80s or ’90s, it would be crackling with zippy one-liners—which writers including Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) were paid top dollar to sprinkle into every script. Instead, Carnahan, who’s made other weighty masculine dramas such as Narc, The Grey, and Copshop, is mostly devoted to exploring how a large sum of money starts breeding suspicion among colleagues.

As Dumars and Byrne, Damon and Affleck are reduced to growling law-enforcement speak, barking into walkie-talkies and carrying out every conversation while at least one hand rests on an automatic weapon—just in case someone bursts through the wall. The supporting cast, including Teyana Taylor, Steven Yeun, Kyle Chandler, and Catalina Sandino Moreno, all get their own assault rifle and dictionary of cop lingo. But it seems they’re more likely on board not because of the material but because of the allure of working with Damon and Affleck. (Perhaps also appealing is the fact that the duo’s production company, Artists Equity, worked out a profit-sharing model with Netflix.) The Rip has little else to offer the actors or the audience beyond a plot built on ratcheting up tension and double-crossing characters.

I’m not sure why this is the movie Damon and Affleck decided to reunite as co-leads for. In the lead-up to The Rip’s release, the pair gave context for the long hiatus they took as artistic collaborators. They didn’t want to be seen as a double act, they explained; the media had quickly regarded Damon and Affleck as such after they co-starred in and won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting. The film, which they wrote together in their early 20s, when they were toiling away on small projects, launched them to megastardom.

Their careers as A-listers have differed quite dramatically, however. Damon became a model of consistency: He headed up robust franchises with the Jason Bourne and Ocean’s movies while also churning out work with serious auteurs such as Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers, and Christopher Nolan. Affleck’s experience with fame was a roller coaster; he appeared in and out of the tabloids and had multiple declines and comebacks. He’s played two different comic-book superheroes, married two different superstars, and become a celebrated director in his own right, even winning Best Picture at the Oscars for Argo. Yet he’s struggled to maintain a similar artistic quality to Damon, bouncing between high highs (such as Gone Girl) and low lows (perhaps most infamously the box-office bomb Gigli).

Damon and Affleck’s proper post-Dogma on-screen reunion came with Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel in 2021, which the pair co-wrote. The movie was a financial disappointment, but it was well reviewed. They followed that up with Air in 2023, a lighter true-story dramedy about Nike’s courtship of Michael Jordan in the 1980s. In both films, Damon took the lead role and Affleck played a princely supporting character who would swoop in for some comic relief—a fine balance they first established in Good Will Hunting, and one that recalled what drew audiences to them all those years ago. But neither reunion was the total head-to-head that some fans might have longed for.

Watch the promotional videos for The Rip and it’s clear why people may clamor for Damon and Affleck to revive their dynamic. They’re not play-acting their friendship for the cameras; they have a deep, shared history, and are canny about how Hollywood has changed in the decades since they tried breaking into the industry together. (For the record, they’ve been pals since Damon, age 10, met Affleck, age 8, at school.) Their real-world mix of camaraderie and quiet rivalry, however, is a vein they’ve somehow rarely tapped on-screen. Off-screen, Affleck has a slightly rougher star persona, while Damon’s can be a little more withdrawn and intellectual. Their characters in The Rip, meanwhile, left me frustrated by their similarity: They’re essentially just playing two sides of the same coin.

Then again, maybe Damon and Affleck are smart to produce a movie like The Rip. Grumbly action dramas seem to play well on streaming services this time of year, when awards season is dying down and viewers turn to something a little trashier. The movie is hardly a catastrophe; it is just a by-the-book, somewhat forgettable little notch in the crime genre. I’m glad Damon and Affleck are comfortable carrying a film together now, after working hard to establish themselves as individuals. But I’d love to see the actors’ chummy New England competitiveness translate beyond the press-tour TikToks and return to the screen—using the differences that make their partnership intriguing to their benefit.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, has become an evangelist of a certain sort. During her tenure, her department has on multiple occasions released slick social-media recruitment videos in which scripture verses feature prominently.

One video quotes from Isaiah 6:8 (“Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, ‘Whom shall I send and who will go for us?’ I said, ‘Here I am. Send me.’”); another quotes from Proverbs 28:1 (“The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.”). The most recent DHS video quotes from Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

What’s striking is less that the federal government is using Bible verses in its promotional videos than that the agency doing the recruiting is Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The videos, set to music, include militaristic images. They show heavily armed agents in tactical gear, weapons drawn, donning masks, looking through night-vision goggles, zip-lining from helicopters, breaking down doors, and conducting nighttime raids.

From the February 2025 issue: The army of God comes out of the shadows

The message the Trump administration is sending is not subtle: ICE is doing the work of God. The brutal and sometimes lethal tactics being used by a growing number of ICE agents are divinely sanctioned. Come join this holy campaign.  Leni Riefenstahl would have approved.

THE KILLING OF RENEE NICOLE GOOD by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has thrust the Department of Homeland Security into the red-hot center of American politics.

A horrifying video of Good being shot—one recent poll found that 82 percent of voters have watched it—provoked nationwide protests and vigils.

Noem, for her part, claimed that Good “committed an act of domestic terrorism” before she was shot four times at point-blank range. After Ross shot Good, a voice on one video could be heard calling her a “fucking bitch.” The Justice Department, meanwhile, is now investigating Good’s widow, prompting six federal prosecutors in Minnesota to resign.

The shooting in Minneapolis wasn’t surprising; under Donald Trump, and especially his immensely powerful aide Stephen Miller, ICE has become militarized, much larger, more aggressive, and less accountable. One former high-ranking Trump-administration official described ICE to me as a “paramilitary police force” under the control of Trump and Miller. (This person requested anonymity for fear of death threats.)

Miller has declared that agents possess “federal immunity,” while Vice President J. D. Vance has said they have “absolute immunity.” Trump, perhaps hoping for a confrontation, wrote on social media on Tuesday, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” Defense Department officials told The Washington Post that the Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for a possible deployment to Minneapolis, after Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, despite opposition from state and local officials.

Federal agents have already flooded the streets of Minneapolis. It is a city under siege; residents there say it “feels like an invasion” and compare it to a “military occupation.” Which is precisely what Trump wants. This has been the game plan all along.

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”

The Bible-quoting videos that ICE is using to recruit agents have a certain logic behind them. DHS says it is looking to hire “brave and heroic Americans,” but it obviously has a special focus on recruiting young men who identify as Christians and whose attitudes and moral instincts align with Trump’s, especially on immigration. Majorities of white evangelicals favor deporting undocumented immigrants to foreign prisons in El Salvador, Rwanda, or Libya without allowing them to challenge their deportation in court (57 percent), and approve of placing immigrants who have entered the country illegally in internment camps (53 percent).

“It has become virtually impossible to write a survey question about immigration policy that is too harsh for white evangelicals to support,” Robert P. Jones, the president of the Public Religion Research Institute, recently wrote.

Tobias Cremer is a member of the European Parliament. His book The Godless Crusade argues that the rise of right-wing populism in the West and its references to religion are driven less by a resurgence of religious fervor than by the emergence of a new secular identity politics. Right-wing populists don’t view Christianity as a faith; rather, Cremer suggests, they use Christianity as a cultural identity marker of the “pure people” against external “others,” while in many cases remaining disconnected from Christian values, beliefs, and institutions.

Many right-wing populists, despite being secular, are successfully recruiting Christians to their cause. And rather than Christians leavening the secular right-wing movements, those movements are prying Christianity further and further away from the ethic and teachings of Jesus.

The Trump administration has gone one step further, inverting authentic Christian faith by selling in a dozen different ways cruelty and the will to power in the name of Jesus. It has welcomed Christians into a theological twilight zone, where the beatitudes are invoked on behalf of a political movement with authoritarian tendencies. This isn’t the first time in history such things have happened.

In the 1920s, within the German Evangelical Church, a movement emerged: Deutsche Christen, or “German Christians.” They became a “church party” that actively supported Adolf Hitler, who self-identified in public as a Christian, even as he privately despised Christianity as a weak religion. Many Germans believed that Hitler had been chosen by God to lead the German state.

The Deutsche Christen promoted the idea of a “heroic” Jesus, even an Aryan Jesus, who fought against the Jewish influence in German life. They were encouraged by the anti-Semitic writings of Martin Luther. In the Martin Luther Memorial Church in Mariendorf, built in 1935, a wood carving on the pulpit depicts Christ preaching to a small group that includes a helmet-wearing Wehrmacht soldier. The church included other Nazi imagery, including an Iron Cross in the church’s chandelier and a baptismal font adorned with a Nazi SA stormtrooper, his head bowed in prayer. The church reflected the desire to construct a Volkskirche—a church that would serve the nation.

This horrifying story isn’t without admirable counterpoints. The Bekennende Kirche, or “Confessing Church,” arose in response to the Deutsche Christen movement. Its most prominent members, including Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemöller, were key in publishing the Theological Declaration of Barmen, one of the most significant religious documents of the 20th century. But ultimately the Bekennende Kirche was forced underground and defeated; Bonhoeffer was hanged at the Flossenbürg concentration camp.

America in 2026 is not Germany in 1936; far from it. But we would be mistaken to pretend that political movements that aren’t as malevolent as Nazism can’t still advance sinister ends. We should also acknowledge that over the course of its history, Christianity, which has had glorious moments, has also taken some very dark turns.

Huge numbers of American fundamentalists and evangelicals—not just cultural Christians, but also those who faithfully attend church and Bible-study sessions and prayer gatherings—prefer the MAGA Jesus to the real Jesus. Few of them would say so explicitly, though, because the cognitive dissonance would be too unsettling. And so they have worked hard to construct rationalizations. It’s rather remarkable, really, to see tens of millions of Christians validate, to themselves and to one another, a political movement led by a malignant narcissist—who is driven by hate and bent on revenge, who mocks the dead, and who delights in inflicting pain on the powerless. The wreckage to the Christian faith is incalculable, yet most evangelicals will never break with him. They have invested too much of themselves and their identity in Trump and what he stands for.

This moment, and what it reveals about American Christianity, will be studied for a long time to come. I imagine that when future generations consider those who corrupted their faith in the name of their faith, those who were in positions of spiritual authority and knew better but still kept quiet, and those who bravely spoke out despite the costs, they will get the verdict right.

Several years ago I had a conversation with a theologian, a scholar of Søren Kierkegaard, who told me, “Christianity has in many cases stopped being the home to Jesus.” That, I fear, is the crux of the issue. Christians need to provide the world evidence of the compelling beauty and truth of God, but we cannot show the world what we ourselves cannot see. “Too late have I loved you, O Beauty so ancient, O Beauty so new,” Augustine wrote in his Confessions. It was Augustine’s lament that it had taken him so many years to discover the beauty of the divine. But having discovered it, he was changed by it.

Elizabeth Bruenig: The Catholic Church and the Trump administration are not getting along

Some time ago, it dawned on me that many Christians attempt to evangelize on behalf of a God we wish we knew but whom we do not really and fully know. We have committed to memory the phrases we tell one another. I have wondered sometimes if we mouth those words in the hopes that doing so will change our hearts.

There are shining counterexamples, of course, including people I have met along the journey who can authentically claim, “Thou and thou only, first in my heart; High King of Heaven, my treasure thou art.” But they are the exception, and it does no one any good to deny it. “Christianity has not produced Christlike people on any meaningful scale,” a theologian once told me. That is vividly evident in American politics today, but it is hardly the only domain in which that is true. And until it is less true, we have very little to teach the rest of the world.

My hope, as a Christian, is that those of us who claim to be followers of Jesus will soon discover what Augustine discovered later than he had wished. That we will fall more in love with Beauty so ancient, Beauty so new. That in doing so in a broken world, we will stand out as expressing our faith through love. That we will be repairers of the breach, true peacemakers. And that we will “shine as stars in the world.” The world would be better for it, and so would we.</div>

            <div id="article-text">I&#39;m not saying that the AI company shouldn&#39;t readily seek permission to harvest and use personal data, but it&#39;s far from a special case. Take Palantir for instance. Are they not doing the same thing?

It seems odd that the onus is on the third-party platform to be transparent to the candidates about data collection and AI use, and not the companies using the tool.

I am all for this lawsuit being successful if it sets a precedent for all AI companies using our data. But if the scope is specifically around the hiring process, I think the individual companies should be held accountable for using the tool without candidates&#39; consent or knowledge.

With how often AI gets its wires crossed with data, this should be mandatory.

This sorta thing happens anyway, on a regular basis.  I don&#39;t know if its AI driven or not, by my father-in-law has a common name and has gotten email in relation to things he has no connection to.  My wife also has a semi-common name and for a while, was getting emails and calls regarding non-existent employment work on her linkedin.

So I would expect errors to be worse with AI and it needs to be held accountable seeing as people&#39;s

Rocksmith 2014 is the only game they&#39;ve published that didn&#39;t suck, and it still stank like Ubisoft.   At least it doesn&#39;t require uPlay nonsense.

I tried playing Assassin&#39;s Creed one time.  I think my character spent like two of the first three hours on his back in a sensory deprivation tank.

I knew this would happen once we started giving video game characters names that aren&#39;t just compounds of the thing they&#39;re doing, like &quot;Jumpman&quot;.

I usually roll my eyes when people say the economy relies on infinite growth, but the AAA games industries are really a microcosm of that philosophy. Bigger and bigger bloat and a focus on monetization instead of innovation until the bubble bursts... they are chasing whales instead of general audiences.

Here is a video on steam and video game price trends. [youtube.com]

They cancelled anything that isn&#39;t Assassin&#39;s Creed. So reading between the lines, the company is going to focus on churning out sequels to their very long running franchises?

Pretty sure captions are not shown unless you enable them.  The only way to unconditionally get them shown is to bake them right into the video itself.

If Donald is actually Christian, then I&#39;m Clark Kent. MAGAs don&#39;t even read the New Testament, only listen to the parts Hannity cherry-picks.

They&#39;ve already swallowed major fantasy improbables based on what they&#39;re told, how to interpret their book, what local leaders say, and not their own assessment of reality.So if anyone can believe the nonsense that the guy guilty of fraud, rape, money laundering, theft, constant lying, serial adultery, ignorant of church and church teachings, is actually a savior picked by God, it could be these guys.

Logical Fallacy: Most liberals agree with ALL opinions of a particular Beatle. Should I likewise paint all MAGAs with the might-makes-right opinions of Stephen Miller?

Addendum: I&#39;m assuming you are (mis) quoting the lyrics of John Lennon&#39;s &quot;Imagine&quot;. If not, then I have no idea what you are talking about.

To me &quot;American values&quot; are democracy, checks & balances on the powerful, freedom of political speech, freedom of and from religion; rewarding logic,  honesty, and humility; and sincere learning from mistakes.

Japan seems to have repeated bad luck with nuclear technologies. While I don&#39;t condone superstitiousness, I can understand their population&#39;s hesitancy.

First, in the Japanese cultural psyche nuclear power is a very prominent thing.  Japan has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the world to have been hit with nuclear weapons in anger, and the cultural sho

For those who need a refresher as to how the failure of the Fukushima reactors, see this video:

Understanding the accident of Fukushima Daiichi (from 2012)https://youtu.be/YBNFvZ6Vr2U [youtu.be]

Total time:  13:01.  The key bit is at 4:49:  &quot;The waves went over the sea wall flooding the lower parts of buildings, and disabled the emergency diesel generators.&quot;

Had those generators and fuel tanks been higher up in the structure, things probably would have been fine, but with the reactors in control-rod shutdown and needing to dissipate the residual heat in the reaction chambers, the secondary cooling systems powered by those emergency diesel generators were absolutely crucial.

They had multiple generators. All were at the same height because they decided not to put them on pylons (obligatory build more...) because the people in the surrounding area said they didn&#39;t want to look at them. Or maybe that&#39;s just an excuse for saving money... And just look how much they saved in the end! Er, wait

There were actually backups to those generators. The situation could have been salvaged. They did manage to get emergency pump vehicles in place and water flowing. Unfortunately a valve diverted the water into tanks instead of into the reactor, and they didn&#39;t notice because the monitoring equipment was damaged by the earthquake.

Or to expand on that: Designers of safety mechanisms should not be excessively stupid.

that all nuclear accidents to date were from gen 1 reactors.

Let Elon Musk get involved, that will change quickly.

Just a reminder that all nuclear accidents to date were from gen 1 reactors.

That is, if we&#39;re not using the U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s formal generational scheme, where gen 2 [wikipedia.org] includes e.g. Chernobyl&#39;s reactor that exploded. So, what you mean is that every serious accident happened in older-era reactors built before modern designs with passive safety features.

Worth noting: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant wasn’t offline because it was unsafe to operate, but because Japan rewrote its nuclear rulebook after Fukushima. The post-2011 requirements are much stricter (earthquakes, tsunamis, backup power, security), and it’s taken years to get approvals. Reactor 6 got through first since it’s newer and already had upgrades.

The restart push is mostly about energy reality: Japan imports most of its fuel, LNG got expensive, and cutting emissions without nuclear is hard. Local opposition is still a factor though, especially given the seismic risks, which is why the rest of the plant is still years away from full operation — if it ever gets there.

It was unsafe. At the time of the earthquake, most of it was offline because the operator, TEPCO, the same guys running Fukishima Daiichi, had falsified safety check data.

The design is fundamentally flawed. It is only rated for horizontal acceleration of 4.5m/s in an earthquake, and back in 2007 it experienced 6.8m/s, with some parts of the plant seeing over 20m/s. Some of the waste storage failed too.

They haven&#39;t fixed that, they just claim to have put measures in place to deal with the reactors getting sh

No, they decided to shut them down, partly for safety concerns, partly for political concerns

If not, where do you draw the line between human effort and tool use?

In both cases the human must adjust parameters to get the desired effect, and the work is done by machine.

Well, that&#39;s certainly a fine demonstration of elitism.

Or maybe not and any one who claims to be an &quot;artist&quot; while presenting ai should be laughed out of the room.You have a valid point, it is not created but generated, however - as always - it is not so easy to mark the line, as AFAIK all (most) computer graphics programs use AI for some options/features.We also have a precedence with introduction of photography - painters of that time for sure claimed it is not art and should be banned from the art exhibitions.I will sustain my suggestion of allowing as a separate category.

aren&#39;t these venues for NOSTALGIA?You misspelled &quot;MARKETING&quot;

Would have been informative if the summary gave the ACTUAL new policy, instead of just &quot;they changed the policy&quot; without saying what they changed it to.

From the article, the new policy is straightforward:

“Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now says. AI is now banned at the art show.

* The article implies it&#39;s possible to distinguish between AI art and art made without AI. In other words, if someone at ComicCon were to present AI art as non-AI art, it would be possible to distinguish between the two. I don&#39;t know if this is true. If it isn&#39;t, then this policy of banning AI art may only result in people saying that the art isn&#39;t AI generated, when it is. Or, it could lead to an evolutionary pursuit by the creators of AI art, so that eventually one can&#39;t tell t

There are lots of situations where a post-event or post-display scrutiny reveals something to fail to comply or to otherwise be in-violation.

The simple solution is to blacklist the individuals or companies that violate the rules if their violations are discovered, and to enable to event organizers a reasonably wide latitude in responding to complaints made and making their decisions based on how a given accused violator responds.

It is accepted practice to hire people to prepair canvas (or what is used) and paint backgrounds, and has been since the Middle Ages. So maybe having an AI do that is acceptable?

Don&#39;t assume the AI is perfect, at least some people can tell the difference. And it seems like some &quot;creators&quot; are intentionally putting in mistakes.

Just because something is on a computer does not make iot perfect, I make my living fixing such stuff...

Interesting! So, can you tell the difference between AI art and non-AI art? Also, when you &quot;correct mistakes&quot; made by AI art, do you think it&#39;s then not AI art?

...* There&#39;s no definition of &quot;AI art&quot; in the article. For instance, what if you use AI to create the art but make changes to it, without using a computer-aided process? Is it still AI art?The policy seems pretty clear on that. &quot;Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” If it was created with AI, making changes to it changes it from wholly AI to partially AI, but it is still not allowedHow many changes would you need to make, theoretically, in order to distinguish between art that&#39;s mostly human and art that&#39;s mostly AI?The policy looks pretty clear. The changes you would need to make would be to discard the AI art and make a different thing without AI.

AI art can be fun, but since it requires no effort to create, it should not be sold.It should clearly be identified as AI, and if the prompt that created it includes a reference to a human artist, the artist should be credited.Even better, the model and prompt should be displayed along with the piece.

People can pay for the fake art with fake money.

Thanks to NFTs, people can now use fake money to pretend that they&#39;re buying fake art!

Then the circle is complete, like a human centipede.

I get it, this is a private event by a private company and they have the right to set whatever rules they wantBut why stop at the arbitrary cutoff at AI which practically is 5-ish year old technology

Why not go full luddite and require art to be created the way it was 100 years ago?

There were special effects in movies 100 years ago. Just watch Charlie Chaplin movies or MetropolisBooks were typed on mechanical typewriters. None of them digital or even electric typewriters or spellcheckers.Photographs were cre

Because AI doesn&#39;t require anything more than a text-prompt, while other methods of producing images or videos require individuals to apply their own creative efforts to the process.

The U.S. may have moved on to another immigration crisis, but Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested last spring after participating in pro-Palestine protests, is still in the middle of his legal battle. Khalil was taken into custody in March, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used mechanism in federal immigration law that claimed that the student’s actions would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The 30-year-old green-card holder was detained for three months, missing the birth of his first child, but was released in June. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a devastating blow to Khalil’s case: A three-judge panel dismissed his habeas corpus petition challenging the federal government’s attempts to detain and deport him.

In a 2–1 decision, the court ruled that the lower district court of New Jersey—which had ordered Khalil to be released from immigration detention in June—did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition. The panel’s majority declared that these petitions challenging a final order of removal can be heard only in immigration court, a system overseen by the attorney general, who also handpicks immigration judges.

Khalil essentially has one option left before being forced to go through immigration court: request a rehearing en banc. If that is approved, all 14 judges on the 3rd Circuit would hear Khalil’s case. But not only does the current makeup of this particular court lean conservative; it received a notable new member last year—Emil Bove. A former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and the former deputy attorney general, Bove has been mired in controversy throughout his tenure in the second Trump administration.

To make sense of Khalil’s options, I spoke with Elora Mukherjee. A professor at Columbia Law School and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Mukherjee submitted an amicus brief in defense of Khalil, along with other students, scholars, and professors who have been charged under the same foreign-policy deportability ground that Khalil currently faces. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: Before we get into the 3rd Circuit’s latest opinion, can you bring us up to speed on how exactly Khalil’s case ended up there?

Elora Mukherjee: On the night that Khalil was wrongly arrested, detained, and targeted for his speech—peaceful speech that should be protected by the First Amendment—he was initially detained at his apartment in graduate student housing at Columbia University. That night, his lawyers immediately filed a federal habeas petition for him with the Southern District of New York.

But by the time that petition was formally filed in federal court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had already transferred Khalil to a detention center in northern New Jersey. For that reason, the initial federal judge assigned to Khalil’s case in SDNY found that he didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition. Instead, he transferred it to the New Jersey federal district court. That transfer was done over the objection of the federal government, which argued that because Khalil was detained in Louisiana, the case should be either dismissed outright or transferred to the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The federal government again tried to get Khalil’s case transferred to Louisiana by filing a motion with the New Jersey district court but was denied. Eventually, the question [of who should hear the case] landed with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

And what do you make of the circuit court’s latest opinion?

The decision is wrong. It was a split decision with two judges in the majority and one judge in the dissent. Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas were in the majority—President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman, and Trump appointed Bibas during his first term. The majority interprets provisions of immigration law that were introduced with the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act as stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claims of individuals like Khalil, who are alleging that their rights are being irreparably harmed.

According to these two judges, Khalil is not eligible to file a federal habeas petition. The only recourse available to him is to raise any defenses that he has, first in his immigration court proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to the federal circuit court that has jurisdiction over the immigration court that initially heard his removal proceedings—in this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

This is exactly what the Trump administration wants. The government has claimed that the jurisdiction stripping provisions of the IIRAIRA are broad in cases over the years, but that position has consistently been rejected in federal courts—including, most recently, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from 2018. In the Jennings case and in similar cases, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently affirmed that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims.

If the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, how can the 3rd Circuit essentially take that away from Khalil?

This is what much of this litigation has been about. The Trump administration’s position is that there should be only one proceeding, and the only proceeding that Khalil is entitled to contest is in Louisiana immigration court. Once he loses in immigration court, he can appeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Once he loses at the BIA, he can appeal that to the relevant federal circuit court, which for him, the administration would argue, is the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That would be the administration’s position because Khalil was detained for the longest period of time in the Western District of Louisiana, and Louisiana is where the immigration judge issued the removal order against him.

In my view, and the position of reasonable people across party lines who care about the rule of law, is that federal habeas proceedings must be available to individuals who are targeted by the executive branch in violation of basic constitutional protections. There is a doctrine that allows for people to go to federal court and file habeas petitions when their constitutional rights have been violated, and it doesn’t require waiting months or years to first exhaust the immigration court proceedings, waiting again for the BIA to rule, and finally getting to a federal circuit court of appeals. By that point in time, Khalil could have been detained for months or years, during which time he would have suffered irreparable harm because of the Trump administration’s violation of his First Amendment rights.

The quick summary of this doctrine is this: If a person is suffering irreparable harm affecting their constitutional rights, then they should be able to seek relief through federal habeas court proceedings without first needing to wait months or years for their immigration proceedings to be exhausted.

Can Khalil appeal the 3rd Circuit’s decision? What options does he have now?

He can request a rehearing en banc with the 3rd Circuit, which is an opportunity for all the judges on the court to rehear his case. The full en banc panel could request a new briefing on these issues from both sides, asking what they think about the panel decision that was issued last week, and it would be extremely likely to have oral arguments. All the judges on the court would have a chance to weigh in on the en banc court’s final opinion, or opinions, as there would likely be a split decision from the 3rd Circuit, given the makeup of that court.

Through the Biden administration, the 3rd Circuit was considered a swing court, in that its makeup was about half appointees from Democratic presidents and about half appointees by Republican presidents. In the last year or so of the Biden administration, there was an opportunity to appoint a judge to the circuit that would result in the court being composed of a slight majority of federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Unfortunately, as the Biden administration ended, it left a vacant seat on the 3rd Circuit, and last year that seat was filled by Emil Bove.

If the en banc’s majority also ends up ruling against Khalil, at that point he would have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants cert in Khalil’s case and issues an opinion, it would likely have consequences for other noncitizen students and scholars who have spoken out against the Trump administration. It also could have broader consequences for noncitizens who are trying to seek habeas relief after they have been wrongly arrested and detained by the executive branch.

While this case has been unfolding, Khalil has had a separate legal challenge active in Louisiana’s immigration court. What’s going on with that one?

This is very confusing, because there are multiple proceedings taking place simultaneously. So there is a proceeding in immigration court in Louisiana, and that is taking place before an agency called the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It’s housed within the Department of Justice and is presided over by an immigration judge. This is one track that was proceeding at the same time the federal habeas proceedings were going forward in the District of New Jersey.

My understanding is that his case is currently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. I don’t know what the briefing schedule is, but it’s worth mentioning that over the past year the Trump administration has fired or reassigned all the reasonable members of the BIA. In 2025, I believe, with one exception, dozens and dozens of cases and opinions issued by the board almost uniformly narrowed the protections available to noncitizens. So there are real questions about whether the BIA is still a meaningful administrative appellate body.

Immigration judges here are also hired by the attorney general, but over the past year, more than 100 immigration judges who didn’t toe the administration’s party line have been fired—they don’t have any of the protections, such as life tenure, that one expects of federal judges. And in hiring announcements for what has historically been called immigration judges, the administration is now calling them deportation judges. The Trump administration is very clear about what it wants these administrative law officers to do. Lastly, the federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana has, the last time I checked, the lowest grant rate for federal habeas petitions in the country. Plus, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is known for being the least likely federal appeals court to protect people’s civil rights.

Five years ago, and to his enduring credit, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy voted to convict Donald Trump on an impeachment charge of “incitement of insurrection.” In a brief statement afterward, Cassidy said, “I voted to convict Trump because he is guilty.”

Cassidy, representing a deep-red state and at the time still ascending toward a committee chairmanship and a meaningful tenure in the Senate, had the most to lose politically of the seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump. He had, however, just won reelection in 2020. He may have bet that Trump would simply disappear into the shadows of American political life before Cassidy had to stand before voters again.

As we are all more aware with each passing minute, that bet was wrong. And lest anyone think that Trump might forgive something like an impeachment vote against him, he quashed that over the weekend when he prospectively endorsed GOP Rep. Julia Letlow in a primary against Cassidy, urging, “RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!,” on his social media account.

Letlow announced her candidacy Tuesday morning. The key lines of her launch video, which features a great many photos of Trump, or of herself with Trump: “A state as conservative as ours? We shouldn’t have to wonder how our senator will vote when the pressure is on.”

Cassidy, in a statement Tuesday, said that Letlow had called him before her announcement and “said she respected me and that I had done a good job.”

He added, “I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election.”

His confidence may not be well placed. Cassidy, who entered the Senate in 2015, was censured by his party following his Trump conviction vote. A Trump endorsement in a GOP primary, in a very red state, means the world, and Letlow is not a gadfly candidate. If Cassidy still wants to have a meaningful tenure in the Senate, he should treat this year as his last. Because there’s a great chance it is.

The senator, who also failed to endorse Trump in 2024, has since done everything he can to win the president’s favor—or at least his indifference. That included absorbing oceans of criticism for his role in supporting one of Trump’s key nominees with whom Cassidy was plainly uncomfortable. Trump must have enjoyed watching him twist in the wind this way for the past year just as much as he enjoys turning on those just as they get their hopes up that he won’t. It’s another warning to anyone who ever might think they’re safe from a change in Trump’s mood.

Those familiar with his campaign-rally routines will know Trump’s many recitations of “The Snake,” something he refers to as a poem but is really a song from the 1960s. The lyrics are about a woman who takes a snake into her home and is then bit by it, to which the snake says, “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” Trump has long used this as a metaphor against lax immigration policies, while everyone else observes that it’s a form of projection and a warning to those who put their trust in Trump.

Cassidy seemed to believe that he could get over the hurdle with Trump in the first year of Trump’s second presidency and at least win his neutrality in a GOP Senate primary. Most notably, Cassidy, despite being a physician who was visibly disgusted with vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services, cast the key vote to confirm Kennedy in the Senate Finance Committee last year. Cassidy did so after receiving a variety of “assurances” from Kennedy that he wouldn’t make all sorts of ruptures to mainstream public health, which Kennedy has gone on to do anyway.

And while Cassidy has been more and more critical of Kennedy over the past year—to no apparent avail—he’s otherwise moved in lockstep with Trump. The pinned posts on both his official and personal X accounts show him beside the president in the Oval Office as Trump signs a MAGA hat for him. You will not see him entertaining defecting Trump on any floor votes or criticizing episodes of executive imperialism. Even for the one issue on which he has spent some capital—criticizing Kennedy—he does it by trying to drive a wedge between Kennedy and Trump. He noted in a September hearing with Kennedy, for instance, that Kennedy has been sharply critical of COVID vaccines, whereas Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in their development.

On a surface level, Cassidy’s sucking up appeared to be paying dividends. Months came and went without Trump endorsing an opponent. Politico asserted, first in an article in September, that things were “looking up” for Cassidy and again, just last week, that Trump was not expected to make an endorsement in either the Louisiana or Texas GOP Senate primaries.

This may have all been a ruse to get through the peak governing season in Trump’s first two years, as the president needed Cassidy as an ally on major nominations and legislation. The New York Times reported over the weekend that Trump first met with Letlow last March and told her that she would have his support if she challenged Cassidy. “But,” the Times added, “he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.”

Cassidy gave the suck-up routine the old college try, but ultimately, the snake did its snake thing. Cassidy now has the choice to either try to out-Trump the Trump-endorsed candidate in the race or accept Trump’s rationale in endorsing Letlow—now that he doesn’t need Cassidy’s help in Congress anymore—and stop offering it.

Cassidy ought to take a look at North Carolina’s Thom Tillis, one of his fellow GOP senators from the 2015 freshman class, and note how much more enlivened and central to the discussion he is now that he’s unshackled from electoral considerations. The country is in a dangerous place right now. The Senate could use another adult voice.

The Supreme Court heard arguments over state-level bans on trans athletes competing in public schools last week. Though it’s hard to imagine the conservative-majority court calling the bans “discriminatory,” trans athletes and allies have reason to hope for a narrow ruling, rather than an expansion of the existing laws.

Over the past week, the Trump administration has escalated its attacks on Minnesota officials and protesters who oppose its immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities. Federal officials have claimed that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are terrorists, and lobbed the same charge against slain protester Renee Good. Donald Trump’s Justice Department has also opened an investigation into Walz and Frey, issuing subpoenas to Democratic officials on Tuesday. The expanding probe appears to lay the groundwork for potential criminal charges against both men for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. It follows Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s declaration last week that Walz and Frey are engaged in outright “terrorism,” promising to stop it “by any means necessary.”

On this week’s episode of Amicus, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Julia Gegenheimer about the rapidly expanding definition of terrorism, obstruction, and other charges that the government is weaponizing against political opponents. Gegenheimer is special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and previously served at the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited for length and clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: You spent years working on cases involving domestic terrorism and extremist violence. Is this what happens when almost anyone can be classified as a “terrorist” and any opposition to the government, including protected First Amendment activities, can be classified as “terrorism”?

Julia Gegenheimer: I think it’s important here, when we talk about domestic terrorism, to take a step back and look at what we actually mean when we use that term. It’s being thrown around a lot in common parlance to stand in for people who are opposed to this administration or its policies, or who are protesting this administration, or who seek to hold it accountable. But federal law actually defines domestic terrorism. Under the law, domestic terrorism involves activities that are “dangerous to human life,” that are in violation of federal criminal law—and, on top of that, have the intent to intimidate a population, or to affect the “conduct” or “policy” of a government by “intimidation or coercion.”

Even then, domestic terrorism is not itself a federal crime. You have to have an underlying federal criminal violation, then these additional layers of motivation or intent stack on top of it. So the impact of throwing this term around very loosely is to threaten criminal punishment for conduct that falls far, far short of what federal law would actually look at as domestic terrorism.

We’ve seen the president and his allies calling these protesters “terrorists.” We’ve seen the government treating protesters like Renee Good much as they treated the fishermen in international waters, whom they bombed without any semblance of due process. It feels to me like an escalation to then accuse elected local and state leaders of terrorism.

It is profoundly disturbing. And the reason why this feels different to you is that it is a bit of a different flavor. It’s pitting the federal government against the states and creating tension where it doesn’t need to be. And frankly, it’s implicitly encouraging acts of political violence against these elected officials by turning them into the enemy.

So we have the Trump administration falsely accusing state and local leaders of encouraging political violence—and, in the process, actually encouraging political violence against the people they’re defaming.

Sure. We’ve seen this throughout history, even recent history: When you put people in opposition like that—when you portray them as the enemy, when you describe them as kind of threatening a person’s way of life or things that they hold dear—that creates the conditions under which people are more likely to resort to political violence, and it becomes more and more the norm.

It feels very much of a piece with the Trump administration treating blue states as the enemy of the federal government and even the American people. The administration is shutting off federal funds to blue states, canceling projects within blue states, trying to suppress the votes of blue state residents. It’s direct hostility and antagonism toward the half of the country that didn’t vote for Trump. It’s also a refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of whom those people did vote for, including Tim Walz.

It seems to me that it leads to a really dark place when the federal government can almost declare war on a state because it didn’t go for him in the most recent election. Then occupy that state with federal agents who are actively hostile and in fact violent toward the local community.

Officials in this administration have been explicit that they are targeting blue states. We’ve seen the surges in Minnesota, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The reasoning behind that has been that these are traditionally blue states or Democratic areas. It doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that that’s what’s going on.

In his address to Minnesotans, Gov. Tim Walz urged residents to bear witness and help to create a record. That record, of course, will be vital in prosecutions, should they ever happen. But at the same time, the Trump administration is telling citizens that following or recording ICE officers is a federal crime and maybe even domestic terrorism. That it’s an obstruction of law enforcement to follow federal agents and to document what they are doing. Is that true?

No. The act of observing and recording officers from a safe distance, including when they are making an arrest, is something that has been long- and well-recognized as protected by the First Amendment.

Could you explain why? There’s a wrinkle here because smartphones are 21st-century technology that the Framers couldn’t possibly have conceived of. But it does seem like this is bedrock First Amendment stuff, right? The First Amendment isn’t just billionaires buying an election. I would think that in a democracy, regular people have a right, if not a duty, to document what public officials are doing on the job, very much including armed agents of the state. Is that something the law bears out?

Yes. Cellphone recordings of ICE activity connect back to these really fundamental principles that the First Amendment was designed to protect. They’re connected to the idea that people have a right to know what their government is doing so they can express views on what their government is doing and protest peacefully against it.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-minnesota-minneapolis-keith-ellison-shooting-protests-violence-lawsuits.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">All weekend long, the headlines out of Minneapolis have captured a moment that is by turns alarming and bizarre.

For instance, in the wake of the killing of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, protesters have been gathering at a federal building out by the airport in the bitter cold. Police have greeted them with chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, downtown, a pardoned Jan. 6 rioter tried to stage a protest in support of the Trump administration. But his small group was quickly overwhelmed—and pelted with water balloons. Locals blasted music from the movie Frozen and carried signs reading “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Around the time that Jan. 6–er was getting soaked, What Next host Mary Harris hopped on a call with Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. On a recent episode of What Next, the two discussed the challenging situation in Minneapolis, why it may take time to bring charges over Good’s killing, and how Ellison is standing up to President Donald Trump. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I want to talk about what your office has been doing in the wake of the killing of Renee Good. You’re working with a local prosecutor to beseech the public to send you evidence in this case, and evidence more generally of how immigration enforcement is going down in the state of Minnesota?

Keith Ellison: Yeah, two different portals. One is through the Hennepin County attorney’s office for evidence concerning the death of Good, and the other one is just general information on what ICE is doing, what they’re up to. And they’re for two separate reasons. One is going to help us determine whether it would be appropriate to file charges against Jonathan Ross, and that decision has not been made yet. And I don’t want people to worry. It is the practice for criminal investigations to first investigate, then make a charging decision.

It’s been days since Renee Good was killed. Many people have seen the video of her death through multiple angles, multiple different videos. Can you explain to me as a lawyer why the evidence I’ve seen is not sufficient to at least impanel a grand jury to consider charges against the officer who shot her?

The reason is very simple. Evidence is being gathered as quickly as possible. The final autopsy is not even done yet, and it might not be done in the normal course of events yet. But also, the local FBI, under the direction of the federal government, has been told to deny the state access to the car, which includes the windows that could show the trajectory of bullets, the shell casings, and the gun.

Wouldn’t bringing charges mean that you had to have access to that evidence? Maybe a judge would say you have to?

Well, look, you want to have the best case before you file charges. You may still need to do some discovery demands.

You mentioned this other portal, the fact that you’re also seeking information about how immigration enforcement is behaving in general in Minneapolis and in Minnesota. And I have to say that over the past week, I’ve seen so much troubling information coming out of Minneapolis. I’ve seen reports of protestors talking about being thrown in cars, being groped by ICE agents, being called names. There are people being told: “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” Are you seeing prosecutable behavior when you see these things?

Yeah—they say it in the most disgusting terms, by the way. It’s not just “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” It’s “Didn’t you see what happened to that effing …,” then there’s an expletive about her sexual orientation. It’s just the nastiest, most revolting, insulting way possible. We’ve seen all of that and more.

But one of the challenges we have right now is that prosecutors do not do investigations; police do them. And, quite frankly, it’s simply outside the experience and culture of police to arrest federal agents, because usually federal agents are doing what the statute says they’re supposed to do, reasonably connected to their legal obligation. They might not do it the way you would do it, and they might violate the rights of people. But more or less, they’re doing what the law says to do. Now, this is very different. I mean, you mentioned throwing people in cars. They’re ripping people out of cars too. They’re smashing their windows. They’re throwing smoke bombs and chemical irritants under the car. There was an infant who stopped breathing and needed CPR by the parents. They’ve been at high schools—saturating high schools, terrorizing kids. There’s been a wide range of crazy behavior.

A federal judge just issued an injunction barring ICE agents from retaliating against protesters in Minnesota. I wonder if you think the federal agents will be abiding by that order, and what that order includes.

Well, let me tell you this: It is a good thing that Judge Kate Menendez issued that very thoughtful order. Before we race ahead and say, “Oh my God, this order could have a problem,” let’s just say that the judge considered the evidence and found that the agency was violating people’s rights and she needed to issue an order to protect them.

What have you learned from seeing how the Trump administration and immigration enforcement have operated in other cities before they came to your region? Are there lessons you took from that? Or do you feel that there are critical differences in how the agents are behaving now that they’re in Minneapolis?

There’s both. The caper they pulled in Chicago, where they descended upon the apartment building, where they’re kicking in doors indiscriminately, that was sort of an indication that we’re dealing with people who have absolutely no sense of legality, propriety, or decency. They will harm anyone they want. People analogize it to the Gestapo. And those analogies are very appropriate. We saw that behavior. Me and my fellow attorneys general talk about this stuff all the time. We’ve been in touch. Of course, the Minnesota one is the biggest surge they’ve done, so nobody really could prepare us for what we’ve seen. But talking to the folks from Oregon, they taught us a lot about using humor. You’ll remember the frog suits and stuff like that.

I would say that we’ve learned a lot from our colleagues, but this one has been the biggest and most severe and most aggressive surge. And so, because of that, we are dealing from no playbook here. But we do have a playbook. It’s called the U.S. Constitution, and we’re going to enforce it.

Republicans say they’re going after your state because there’s a big undocumented population (that’s a lie) and that the Somali community has been engaged in fraud, and that fraud has not been taken seriously by the local leaders. What do you say to that?

Well, if Trump wanted to help us deal with fraud, he would have sent us accountants. Instead, he sent us armed paramilitaries wearing masks, kicking in doors, grabbing whoever. Now, how is that rationally related to white-collar-crime reduction? It’s just ridiculous.

Do you think there’s anything leaders in Minnesota could have done to prevent this? Some would say taking the fraud more seriously would have prevented the most aggressive action.

First, we take fraud very seriously. My office has prosecuted over 300 people for Medicaid fraud and convicted them. And some have gone to prison, and they’ve all been held accountable. This is not about fraud. And if Trump was so concerned about fraud, why would he be pardoning fraudsters who have been committing fraud all over the country? He himself has Trump University fraud. He himself has been convicted civilly. He’s had a civil liability for defrauding the assessment of his buildings and in his taxes.

It’s not about fraud. You’re never going to see somebody doing something wicked and evil and bad saying it. It’s never happened in the history of humanity. Even Hitler said, “I was protecting the homeland and my people.” Mussolini had a reason. Franco had a reason. They all have a reason for the wickedness that they do.

If and when the Department of Justice opens an investigation into you, I wonder if you have a game plan.

I got a lawyer. That’s my game plan. Here’s the thing: Your question is a good one, because what wrong was Tish James doing? None. What wrong was James Comey doing? None. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve committed a crime or acted in violation of the law. What matters is if you’ve offended the king.

It doesn’t sound as if you have any problem offending the king.

I would have no problem giving credit where credit is due if any was due. I just haven’t seen any. This is a president who has taken onto himself the power to tax—that’s what a tariff is—which is Congress’ job. He’s taken onto himself the power to spend. He’s taken onto himself the power to adjudicate what the outcome of a particular controversy should be. That’s the judiciary’s job. He is collapsing the functions of the three levels of government into himself. And then the other element of federalism, which is the balance between the state and the central government, he’s trying to convert states into lesser bodies of sovereignty than we are. And so what do we do with that? Stand around and hope for the best? At some point, just trying to be polite isn’t going to work. And there’s no amount of sucking up that’s going to win you favor from this guy.

            <div id="article-text">Password managers make great targets for attackers because they can hold many of the keys to your kingdom. Now, LastPass has warned customers about phishing emails claiming that action is required ahead of scheduled maintenance and told them not to fall for the scam.

According to LastPass, the latest phishing campaign began around January 19 with emails being sent from several addresses with multiple subject lines. All of these are about LastPass maintenance, and they all urge customers to back up their vaults within 24 hours.

&quot;Please be advised that LastPass is NOT asking customers to backup their vaults in the next 24 hours,&quot; the company said in a Monday security advisory.

&quot;This is an attempt on the part of a malicious actor to generate urgency in the mind of the recipient, a common tactic for social engineering and phishing emails,&quot; the alert continued. &quot;Please remember that no one at LastPass will ever ask for your master password.&quot;

LastPass vaults contain customers&#39; most sensitive information - usernames, passwords, credit card details, and secure notes - protected by a single master password. This makes LastPass a constant target for criminals who can use these details for all sorts of financial and identity fraud.

Just two months ago, the password manager sounded the alarm on another phishing campaign asking users to confirm that they aren&#39;t dead.

The emails were sent over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend in the US, and this timing reflects another trick that fraudsters use. Because many people have the day off work, there are likely fewer employees to report the scam, which usually helps postpone detection of the phishing campaign.

A screenshot of a January 20 phishing email includes a link purporting to allow customers to &quot;create backup now.&quot; But instead of backing up their LastPass vault, it redirects victims, first to: group-content-gen2.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws[.]com/5yaVgx51ZzGf

Instead of helping customers back up their vaults, however, clicking on the link redirects victims to a phishing site designed to trick them into handing over that master password, potentially exposing the credentials stored in their LastPass vault.

&quot;Rest assured, we are working with our third-party partners to have this domain taken down as soon as possible,&quot; LastPass said in its online advisory.

LastPass did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries, including how many customers received phishing emails and fell victim to the scam. We will update this story when we receive a response.

The advisory also includes a list of malicious URLs and associated IP addresses, along with email addresses sending the phishes and subject lines - so check those out to help with threat hunting efforts. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump and Jensen Huang both took the stage at Davos today, giving attendees a myriad of reasons to feel assured or panic stricken about humanity’s future, depending on your point of view.

In a delayed and wide-ranging speech, the American president tilted at windmills, expressed his love for Europe while lamenting its demise, impersonated Emmanuel Macron&#39;s voice, and suggested he wouldn’t use military force to take Greenland, which he described as a “big, beautiful piece of ice”.

“We won’t get anything unless I use excessive strength and force, when we would be unstoppable. I won’t use force,” he said. But he added, the US would remember if it didn’t get what it wanted.

“[It’s] very important we use it for national and international security,” he said in a Q&A session afterwards, adding: “We’ll see what happens.”

Zeroing in on AI, Trump said, “We&#39;re leading the world in AI by a lot. We&#39;re leading China by a lot. I think President Xi respects what we&#39;ve done.”

In part, he said, this leadership was because “I&#39;ve allowed these big companies building these massive buildings, to build their own electric capacity.”

Companies wanting to build out datacenters had run into the challenge of the US’ aging grid, Trump said. But the president claims he invented a solution. “And I came up with the idea. ‘You know, you people are brilliant. You have a lot of money. Let&#39;s see what you can do. You can build your own electric generating plants.’

“And they looked at me, they didn&#39;t believe me,” said Trump.

But he told the tech titans, that “Not only am I not kidding, you&#39;re going to have your approvals within two weeks.” At least for electricity. “Nuclear will take three weeks.”

This was the complete opposite to what is happening in Europe thanks to the “radical left” he said. “The United Kingdom produces just one third of the total energy from all sources that it did in 1999. Think of that. One third and they&#39;re sitting on top of the North Sea, one of the greatest reserves anywhere in the world, but they don&#39;t use it.”

Towards the end of his long, long speech, Trump returned to the theme of defending Western Culture, and the need to “Rediscover the spirit that lifted the west from the depths of the Dark Ages to the pinnacle of human achievement” in a rapidly changing world.

AI was part of that change, he said. “I mean, AI, two years ago, nobody ever heard of the term, and now everybody&#39;s talking about it,” he told the audience. “And it can have some very good purpose. It could also have some dangerous purpose, and for that, we have to watch out.”

Trump was speaking shortly after Nvidia boss Huang sketched out the latest iteration of his view of AI, pushing back on suggestions of an AI bubble, and also raising the energy issue.

Huang said AI was a five layer cake, with the need for energy at the bottom, with value created at the top, application layer.

At the same time, he touted the promise of agentic AI, and of robotics and physical AI.

Huang insisted that the technology was not destroying jobs. Rather, he said, it was increasing the demand for skilled labor around chip manufacturing, power, and datacenter construction. He added that Europe was arguably better placed in terms of “trades” than the US.

At the same time, AI is helping address skills shortages in key areas such as medicine, lowering the admin burden on nurses, or speeding up diagnoses by radiologists.

But while Trump focused on the US dominating the AI world, Huang touted its adoption by other countries, not least through open models.

“I really believe that that every country should get involved to build AI infrastructure, build your own AI, take advantage of your fundamental natural resources, which is your language and culture.”

Asked if there was a bubble, Huang suggested that there was not enough VC investment in AI. More to the point, he said: “If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU [in the cloud] in these days, it&#39;s so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs.”

Huang’s internationalist approach was not shared by fellow AI big wigs. As The Reg revealed yesterday, Anthropic boss Dario Amodei railed against Nvidia and the White House for OK-ing the export of H200 chips, as well as AMD parts, to China.

The US was ahead of China in its silicon capabilities, he said. So it was a &quot;a big mistake&quot; to ship those parts, one with &quot;incredible national security implications&quot;.

&quot;It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.&quot; ®

            <h2>Social Security Administration admits it underreported DOGE dirty dealings</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/social_security_administration_doge_data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">DOGE&#39;s mucking around at the Social Security Administration (SSA) has been heavily scrutinized, but now the SSA itself is admitting it slightly underreported the unofficial agency&#39;s improper activities within its systems. DOGE employees may have been asked to assist a political advocacy group using SSA data, prompting Hatch Act referrals.

The Department of Justice, acting as the legal representative for the SSA in a lawsuit filed against it by multiple US government employee unions, filed a record correction [PDF] in court last week amending a number of claims made in March by then-acting SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek.

According to last week&#39;s filing, the Elon Musk–led DOGE effort retained certain SSA system access after US District Judge Ellen Hollander issued a temporary restraining order limiting that access, and SSA data were routed outside the agency on multiple occasions, including through an encrypted file and third-party sharing tools.

Even worse than that, the DOJ noted in its filing, email evidence shows that a pair of DOGE employees at SSA were approached by a political advocacy group asking them to help the group find evidence of voter fraud in a bid to overturn state-level elections. One of the DOGE employees even signed a &quot;voter data agreement,&quot; the contents of which weren&#39;t explained in the filing, with the unnamed group. The agreement reportedly wasn&#39;t reviewed by the SSA, nor was it approved through the agency&#39;s data exchange procedures.

&quot;DOGE Team members could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls,&quot; the filing states, &quot;but SSA has not yet seen evidence that SSA data were shared with the advocacy group.&quot;

The activity of those two DOGE members led to referrals to the US Office of Special Counsel over potential Hatch Act issues, a 1939 law that restricts certain political activities by federal civil service employees.

Mystery records transmitted to outside sources

Politically-motivated activity involving SSA systems by employees is bad enough, but the previously unreported DOGE damage didn&#39;t stop there.

The filing also contradicts Dudek&#39;s claims from March that DOGE &quot;never had access to SSA systems of record&quot; by finding that DOGE employees at SSA sent an email to the Department of Homeland Security and a DOGE advisor at the Department of Labor that included &quot;an encrypted and password-protected file that SSA believes contained SSA data.&quot;

&quot;From the explanation of the attached file in the email body and based on what SSA had approved to be released to DHS, SSA believes that the encrypted attachment contained PII derived from SSA systems of record, including the names and addresses of approximately 1,000 people,&quot; the DOJ explained in the filing. The SSA reportedly still hasn&#39;t been able to access the file to determine what&#39;s actually in it.

While the filing maintains that Dudek&#39;s claims were and still are accurate regarding DOGE not having official access to SSA systems of record, another part of the filing says DOGE was granted access to a range of SSA systems - some involving PII or data derived from systems of record - that SSA says were either unused or of unknown use.

SSA employee records, facility access systems, fraud and analytics shared workspaces, data-visualization tools connected to other data sources &quot;which could provide access to PII,&quot; and enterprise data warehouse schemas &quot;beyond those reported as of March&quot; were in effect for various DOGE employees until they were terminated in late March, according to the filing.

In addition, the SSA learned since Dudek made his declaration in court that DOGE was using Cloudflare to share data amongst itself in violation of SSA rules.

&quot;Cloudflare is not approved for storing SSA data and when used in this manner is outside SSA&#39;s security protocols,&quot; the filing explained. &quot;SSA did not know, until its recent review, that DOGE Team members were using Cloudflare during this period.&quot;

It&#39;s not clear whether the Cloudflare report is related, but a whistleblower claimed last August that DOGE was transmitting data from the SSA&#39;s Numident database (a master record of every application ever submitted for a US Social Security card) to an unauthorized cloud environment. Numident is only mentioned in last week&#39;s record correction filing, but only in relation to PII searches run against it after the temporary restraining order was issued.

Nonetheless, it gives credence to the whistleblower reports, which the SSA has continued to deny.

Not that the SSA actually knows what data DOGE put on Cloudflare - like the encrypted file emailed to DOL and DHS, &quot;SSA has not been able to determine exactly what data were shared to Cloudflare or whether the data still exist on the server.&quot;

Don&#39;t take any of these admissions to be confirmation that SSA was hiding information from the courts, naturally. The Administration maintains that Dudek&#39;s statements were all correct when he made them, &quot;and SSA believes them to be accurate today,&quot; despite the evidence presented by DOJ in the filing.

We reached out to plaintiffs in the case, who didn&#39;t respond to questions, nor did the SSA or the White House. The DOJ only referred us to the court filings, and a source familiar with the matter told us that the DOJ isn&#39;t investigating DOGE, which is unsurprising given its role in this case. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Space Agency (ESA) has unveiled a full-scale structural mock-up of the landing platform for its long-delayed ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover.

The platform&#39;s four legs must ensure the rover survives its final moments of descent, equipped with shock absorbers and sensors designed to trigger engine shutdown upon touchdown on Mars. Timing is critical: switch them off too soon, and the landing might be harder than planned. Too late, and Martian soil might be blasted into sensitive places.

There is also a risk the whole thing will tip over if the engines are left running too long, or if the lander touches down at an angle or on top of a rock.

&quot;The last thing you want is for the platform to tip over when it reaches the Martian surface. These tests will confirm its stability at landing,&quot; said Benjamin Rasse, ESA&#39;s team leader for the ExoMars descent module.

Teams from Thales Alenia Space and Airbus (which is providing the landing platform) spent more than a month dropping the model onto various surfaces to verify the system works as intended. Next, they&#39;ll drop it onto a moving sledge at higher speeds to simulate angled landings.

The ExoMars team has faced repeated delays due to technical problems, and Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine put paid to a 2022 launch. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, was supposed to provide a launch vehicle and lander for the rover, but cooperation was suspended mere months before the spacecraft was scheduled to travel to the Red Planet. The mission now targets a 2028 launch.

In 2025, Airbus UK won a £150 million contract to complete the rover&#39;s landing system. NASA will contribute the launch vehicle, heater units, and rockets to assist with the landing. The 2028 launch is scheduled from Kennedy Space Center in Florida and is expected to go ahead between October and December. The bot will finally arrive at Mars in 2030.

NASA&#39;s involvement in the project has been turbulent. Originally a partner, the agency withdrew after budget cuts, prompting Roscosmos to join before Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine caused a suspension of cooperation. NASA then signed on again in 2024, before the Trump administration proposed slashing the agency&#39;s budget.

In late 2025, ESA boss Josef Aschbacher stated that NASA had confirmed its contribution would go ahead as planned.

The successful tests offer relief to ESA managers but underscore how much work remains before the 2028 launch window. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/stargate_openai_community_plans/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI wants every Stargate datacenter campus to come with its own community plan reflecting &quot;local concerns,&quot; including a commitment not to cause a hike in electricity prices, minimizing water use, and protecting local ecosystems.

The Stargate project, launched almost exactly a year ago, aims to spend as much as $500 billion on infrastructure to power AI development over the next several years.

However, datacenter projects have been facing increasing opposition from local communities, especially massive projects such as those at Stargate&#39;s site Abilene, Texas, where ten buildings each covering half a million square feet are being constructed.

Such developments can dominate the landscape, and communities living in their shadow have complained about noise, the amount of water and energy they might consume, and that they tend not to create many long-term local jobs.

Research org Data Center Watch reported that 20 US server farm projects were blocked or delayed amid local opposition during Q2 2025 alone.

In response, OpenAI says it is &quot;committed to working with communities&quot; to ensure its Stargate campuses are built and run in a way that strengthens such communities and &quot;demonstrates that we&#39;re being good neighbors.&quot;

It promises locally-tailored community plans for every campus, driven by input from residents. However, each plan will include a commitment to pay its own way on energy, so that the project&#39;s operations don&#39;t lead to a jump in electricity prices.

Stargate may fund extra generating capacity and grid upgrades, for example, as well as working with power companies on operating AI campuses as flexible loads, so that its facilities can reduce or curtail their consumption during periods of peak demand.

This sounds laudable, but a cynic might point to the fact that President Trump recently declared that tech giants ought to pay their way when it comes to delivering the extra power they need, and Microsoft has already beaten them to it with its announcement of &quot;Community-First AI Infrastructure.&quot;

Another pledge is to minimize water use by prioritizing closed-loop or low-water cooling systems. Many AI server systems run so hot that they need direct-to-chip liquid cooling infrastructure, which requires less water than more traditional methods involving evaporation.

OpenAI also says it will invest in local jobs by establishing OpenAI Academies as the backbone of regional workforce development in communities close to its facilities. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Stargate&#39;s site in Texas will only have about 100 full-time workers once operational, although many more will be employed during the construction phase.

The firm recently announced it has hired former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to head up OpenAI for Countries, an initiative to export the company&#39;s Stargate project to other nations beyond the US. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Palantir CEO Alex Karp has an inimitable aptitude for sniffing out the politically sensitive topic about which, by his own admission, he should not be speaking, but which will also win him the most attention.

Last year, it was the idea of innate western superiority and his belief that his company&#39;s software product was &quot;the only reason why someone&#39;s not goose-stepping between me and you&quot; on the streets of Europe.

This week, after promising not to go on one of his &quot;usual political screeds,&quot; the Palantir CEO went off on one, as the Brits like to say, launching into a speculative analysis of the impact of AI on immigration. Two hot topics in one: bingo.

Flying into Davos for the World Economic Forum — or perhaps appearing in a puff of red smoke from under a ghoulish cloak — Karp responded to probing about the impact of AI on the jobs market.

&quot;I do think these trends [in AI] really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill,&quot; he said.

He was unlikely to have his worldview significantly challenged by his interviewer, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the septuagenarian billionaire Co-Chairman of the World Economic Forum.

And so it proved, with Fink gliding past the notion that many immigrants fulfil roles in health, construction, or service industry jobs that western nations find hard to fill, and focusing on the important point for attendees: the impact on white-collar jobs.

The point is not without merit: 4.7 million non-US-born workers fulfil professional and business services roles, for example.

During the World Economic Forum session, Karp agreed that AI would lead to fewer white collar jobs. But went on to say that organizations &quot;need different ways of testing aptitude.&quot;

&quot;There are a lot of people doing X that should be doing Y,&quot; he said, adding that one of his main tasks at the US-based spy-tech company was &quot;walking around figuring out what is someone&#39;s outlier aptitude.&quot;

Outside the febrile atmosphere of the WEF Annual Meeting, skeptics on the actual benefits of AI are becoming more commonplace.

Yesterday, Deutsche Bank analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan published a note declaring the &quot;the honeymoon is over&quot; for AI. The AI market will be hit by disillusionment, dislocation, and distrust, they said. &quot;This matters as AI investment and optimism are buoying the global economy, accounting for most of economic and earnings growth in the US last year,&quot; they said, suggesting the consequences should the AI boom go into reverse.

The sentiment echoed earlier comments from Gartner, which said enterprise adoption of AI was in the so-called &quot;trough of disillusionment,&quot; while investment from AI, cloud, and software companies was still sky-rocketing. Meanwhile, the majority of CEOs are reporting zero pay-offs from AI investments, according to PwC.

Karp admitted AI is a &quot;very low-trust environment,&quot; which is why Palantir needs very few salespeople.

In the case of building AI systems, he said, &quot;people have tried lots of stuff. A lot of it hasn&#39;t worked. But if [like Palantir] you&#39;ve delivered stuff that does work, why do you need a salesforce?&quot;

Of course, in the conversation about AI and the future of work in the western world, Karp found room to claim Palantir&#39;s enterprise projects can save &quot;80 percent of your cost and improve your top line dramatically.&quot;

Perhaps the question is really, when you have Alex Karp, why do you need a salesforce? He admitted he got pressure from inside Palantir saying he &quot;should stop speaking in public,&quot; but that&#39;s all part of the schtick. Because, notwithstanding the chronic verbal diarrhea, his outlier aptitude is undoubtedly making himself and his company the center of attention. It&#39;s a shame we will all smell the consequences when the winds change. ®

The rumored battery pack could deliver up to 15W of power wirelessly, or up to 20W via USB-C.

It looks like Samsung is preparing to launch a new Qi2 battery pack for the upcoming Galaxy S26, which is rumored to support the upgraded charging standard. A report from Winfuture

shows off leaked images of what appears to be the new accessory, outfitted with a magnetic Qi2 charging ring that delivers up to 15W of power, along with a USB-C cable offering up to 20W.

Winfuture suggests that the wireless power bank itself will have a 5,000 mAh battery capable of charging at up to 25W. The battery pack also appears to come with an arm that you can fold out to use as a stand. This isn’t the first time we’re hearing about this accessory; last December, 9to5Google spotted a Samsung “Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack” in the Wireless Power Consortium’s database.

As noted by Winfuture, the power bank could cost €59.90, or around $70.

Though Samsung’s last-gen Galaxy S25 phones support “Qi2 Ready” cases, they don’t come with the built-in magnets needed for a Qi2 certification. The Galaxy S26 could change this, as well as introduce some potential updates like new camera bumps and an Ultra-only anti-snooping privacy display.

            <h2>Volvo aims for an EV reset with the new EX60 crossover</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864561/volvo-ex60-range-price-specs">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The EX60 is a crossover SUV, which is the best-selling segment right now. And while its design looks familiar, the tech inside is a big upgrade.

The EX60 is a crossover SUV, which is the best-selling segment right now. And while its design looks familiar, the tech inside is a big upgrade.

Volvo’s EX60, with fast-charging capabilities and a brand-new electric architecture, made its official debut today, with the Swedish automaker positioning the crossover EV as a new direction for its battery-powered lineup. With up to 400 miles of estimated range and an 800-volt architecture for ultra-fast charging, the EX60 feels like a concerted effort by Volvo to address some of the most common pain points of EV ownership. But it also represents Volvo’s effort to reshuffle its supply chain and production process for a better chance at earning a profit on its EV lineup.

At first glance, the EX60 looks a little familiar, with an exterior design reminiscent of Volvo’s other EVs and hybrids, like the EX90 and XC70. But the new crossover SUV is built on a totally new platform, Volvo’s SPA3 (Scalable Product Architecture 3), which comes with a raft of new capabilities and features that have been absent from the company’s lineup.

SPA3 is designed for modularity, meaning its hardware and software can be continuously improved. It’s also the first vehicle to benefit from Volvo’s new megacasting production process to reduce weight and improve manufacturing efficiency. And it will utilize a structural battery pack, in which the high-voltage cells are actually part of the structural chassis.

But the processing power is arguably the showcase, with Volvo claiming the EX60 is its “most intelligent” car to date. The EX60 is built around HuginCore, Volvo’s state-of-the-art hardware and software system, which brings together the automaker’s in-house technology with features from Google, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. Volvo says the result is a vehicle that’s faster, smarter, and continuously improving through over-the-air updates.

The EX60 will be Volvo’s first car to feature Google’s Gemini as its new AI assistant. The assistant is “deeply integrated” into the vehicle’s operating system, allowing drivers to have “natural and personalized” conversations. And the infotainment system is designed to be highly responsive with zero lag — but of course we’d need to test it ourselves to say for sure.

The 800-volt architecture, a first for Volvo, also feels like a feature aimed at reducing lag, but this time for charging. Other automakers, like Hyundai and Kia, have stood out amid cooling demand for EVs thanks to their fast-charging, 800-volt-architecture vehicles, and now Volvo wants to do the same. The EX60 can charge from 10–80 percent in 19 minutes, or add 168 miles of range in just 10 minutes, when using a 400kW fast charger. The native NACS charge port will allow EX60 owners to fast-charge at Tesla Supercharger stations.

Volvo is also offering for the first time a global 10-year battery warranty covering up to 240,000km. This extends the company’s previous eight-year coverage and reflects confidence in its in-house battery development and manufacturing capabilities.

The EX60 will have other tricks up its sleeve, too, including vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid functionality as standard across all markets and trims. Volvo has already announced a partnership with Swedish energy provider Vattenfall to explore how the EX60 and other Volvo EVs can help stabilize and balance the grid.

The EX60 will come in three powertrain variants: the P6, with 310 miles of estimate range; the P10, with 320 miles; and the P12, with 400 miles. The P10 and P12 will both come with all-wheel drive for instant torque and improved traction. The P6’s single motor is in the rear wheel, for a lighter, more agile driving experience. With propulsion system will come in either Plus or Ultra trim levels for added comfort. The P6 and P10 will go into production starting April 2026, with the P12 to follow later in the year.

The P10, which Volvo says will start at around $60,000, comes with an impressive array of standard features, including a 21-speaker Bose sound system, 15-inch curved OLED center display with Google built-in, a large panoramic roof, 360-degree camera, 20-inch five-spoke diamond-cut wheels, Pilot Assist driver-assist system, three-zone climate control, metallic paint, active suspension, and a 19.2kW onboard charger.

The EX60 will arrive in a much different world than Volvo would likely prefer. After the flubs associated with the three-row EX90’s launch, the automaker is clearly hoping to recapture some excitement by introducing an new EV in the most popular segment for any vehicle, electric or otherwise: a two-row, five-passenger crossover SUV.

And with an upgraded manufacturing process at Volvo’s historic Torslanda plant in Sweden and the inclusion of megacasting, Volvo is also aiming for a profitable vehicle too. Using this process, the EX60 will have its entire rear underbody cast by an 8,400-ton casting machine, allowing Volvo to replace around 100 separate parts with a single piece of aluminum.

Volvo is calling this its smartest, longest-range, and fastest-charging EV to date — which is noteworthy because those are the superlatives it used to describe the China-made ES90 sedan when it seemed like that EV was next in line for production. Now the ES90 has been delayed thanks to tariffs and concerns about profitability, leaving the EX60 as Volvo’s leading effort to right the ship on EVs.

            <div id="article-text">Six games have been canceled, and Ubisoft is shutting down several studios and restructuring others.

Six games have been canceled, and Ubisoft is shutting down several studios and restructuring others.

Ubisoft is announcing a major reorganization, and with the changes, it’s refocusing its portfolio and canceling some games, including the beleaguered remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. With the reorganization, Ubisoft will focus its efforts on big open worlds and live service games and is making “accelerated investments” in “player-facing Generative AI.”

In the new structure, which goes into effect in April, Ubisoft’s new operating model will “be structured around five Creative Houses,” supported by a “Creative Network providing development resources, shared Core Services and a reshaped HQ.” The brands under each Creative House, which include the studio announced last year dedicated to Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, will be focused on different genres:

CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands;

Brands: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six

CH2 dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences;

Brands including The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell

CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences;

Brands including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, Skull & Bones

CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes;

Brands including Anno, Might & Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good & Evil

CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games.

Brands including Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, Hasbro

Ubisoft is also developing four new franchises, including March of Giants, the MOBA Amazon offloaded last year after its own recent gaming reprioritization. Ubisoft is revising its three-year roadmap and has canceled six games with the reorganization, including four unannounced games, three new franchises, a mobile game, and the Sands of Time remake.

“While the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents,” according to the Prince of Persia X account. “Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise.”

Seven games are being delayed as well, including one unannounced game being pushed from fiscal year 2026 to fiscal year 2027. Ubisoft will bring employees back to the office five days per week, with an “an annual allowance” of work-from-home days.

The company has closed its Halifax mobile studio, its Stockholm studio, and is restructuring its Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive studios.

﻿The Eleven Album is supposed to showcase ‘how artists can use AI to expand their creative range.’

ElevenLabs has released an album of AI-generated songs in its latest attempt to separate itself from the ethical concerns surrounding AI music. The Eleven Album aims to showcase “how artists can use AI to expand their creative range while maintaining full authorship and commercial rights,” according to ElevenLabs.

ElevenLabs is using the album to market its Eleven Music generator and Iconic Voices Marketplace platforms it launched last year, both of which are cleared for commercial use. ElevenLabs says that every artist on the project “produced a fully original track that blends their signature sound with the capabilities of Eleven Music,” and retains full ownership of their work alongside earning 100 percent of any streaming revenue.

The Eleven Album features a mishmash of musical genres and spoken word from 13 artists (which feels like a missed opportunity), including:

You can listen to the album — or to cite ElevenLabs, “experience the future of sound” — on Spotify or the ElevenLabs website.

This comes as music labels have started to shift their perspectives on AI’s place within the industry. After months of fighting with music generators and online platforms over copyright infringement, Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Records have forged deals with Suno, Udio, and other AI platforms. Sony Music Entertainment also joined Warner and UMG in inking deals with Klay’s “ethical” AI platform.

ElevenLabs is trying to avoid missing out on those monetization opportunities by appealing to artists directly. Many have voiced strong opposition to having their voice, style, and likeness cloned. Without compensation and ownership rights, those AI clones could impact their ability to make money, given that most people can’t distinguish between AI-generated and human-made music.

            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration is bending the rules to open up the deep sea to commercial mining for the first time.

The Trump administration is bending the rules to open up the deep sea to commercial mining for the first time.

The Trump administration took the next step toward unilaterally jumpstarting deep-sea mining this week, announcing a “consolidated” permitting process for both searching for and commercially extracting minerals that have so far remained relatively untouched.

These minerals are found so deep in the sea that they’re beyond any single nation’s national jurisdiction — which is why President Trump has sparked outrage over his efforts to bypass an international mining code. A chorus of scientists and ocean advocates warn that disturbing the deep seabed could trigger a chain of unforeseen consequences that could eventually harm coastal communities around the world.

Those concerns have been enough to push some companies that might even benefit from a new source of these minerals — coveted for producing rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, renewable energy, and all kinds of gadgets — to pledge not to use any of the materials sourced from the deep sea. The deep sea is dotted with polymetallic nodules containing nickel, cobalt, manganese, and other minerals used in rechargeable batteries.

Disturbing the deep seabed could trigger a chain of unforeseen consequences

The new rules the Trump administration announced would make it easier for American companies to start harvesting those minerals. Typically, they’d apply first for an exploration license that allows them to start surveying and studying a site. Then, they might move forward with a request for a commercial recovery permit. Now, they’ll be able to apply for both at the same time. It also truncates the environmental review process, since the consolidated application could only require a single environmental impact statement.

The updated rules crafted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) follow through on an executive order Trump signed last April telling federal agencies to expedite the process for issuing licenses in order to “counter China’s growing influence over seabed mineral resources.”

Other leaders have accused the Trump administration of violating international law by doing so. The International Seabed Authority (ISA), established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) says “unilateral exploitation of resources that belong to no single State but to all of humanity is prohibited.”

The Trump administration, on the other hand, claims in a 113-page document published yesterday that the NOAA can “issue licenses and permits to U.S. citizens in areas beyond national jurisdiction” under the 1980 US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. The document also argues that ISA merely regulates deep seabed mining for countries that are parties to the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC), which the US has not joined.

The ISA has been deadlocked in its attempts at finalizing an official mining code that would govern how any commercial deep-sea mining would proceed. Forty countries have called for a moratorium or ban on deep-sea mining because there’s still so little that humanity understands about the seafloor and the ripple effects that could result from disturbing it. Some car companies and tech companies including Apple and Google have also endorsed a moratorium; solar company Sunrun joined last month.

Nearly 1,000 marine scientists and policy experts have similarly voiced their opposition. Even the surface of the moon is better mapped than the ocean’s abyss, according to NASA. Researchers are also trying to assess whether it’s a source of dark oxygen for life on Earth.

“By fast-tracking mining in unexplored areas of the deep ocean, the Trump administration is practically inviting an environmental disaster,” Emily Jeffers, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “Deep-sea mining could change the ocean forever, but Trump officials are basically just rubberstamping the exploitation of these little-understood ecosystems.”

If you want better audio than your phone can deliver while creating content on the go but a high-end wireless mic isn’t in the budget, DJI’s Mic Mini is worth a look. It’ll improve your audio without putting much of a dent in your wallet, especially today now you can buy it with a single mic and two transmitters for $59.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, matching its best price to date.

The Mic Mini is a small wireless microphone designed to deliver clearer, more professional-sounding audio than built-in phone and camera mics. Its receiver plugs directly into a phone, camera, or other devices via USB-C or a standard 3.5mm audio cable, with a Lightning adapter available for older Apple devices and Bluetooth support. DJI also includes a dial on the receiver with five adjustable volume levels, and you can pair two transmitters at once so you can capture audio from up to about 400 meters away when you need more range.

Weighing just 10 grams, the Mic Mini is also comfortable to wear and can be clipped to clothing or worn using a magnetic mount or lanyard so it stays visible on camera. Despite its tiny size, the transmitter lasts up to 11.5 hours on a single charge, though, while the receiver can run for up to 10.5 hours. While you won’t get pro-level features like an onboard screen for monitoring audio levels or built-in backup recording, for casual content creation on the go, the Mic Mini covers the essentials well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are many paths AI evolution could take. On one end of the spectrum, AI is dismissed as a marginal fad, another bubble fueled by notoriety and misallocated capital. On the other end, it’s cast as a dystopian force, destined to eliminate jobs on a large scale and destabilize economies. Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.

All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data. Based on a proprietary data set covering the last 130 years, Davis and his team developed a new framework, The Vanguard Megatrends Model, from research that suggested a more nuanced path than hype extremes: that AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology that lifts productivity, reshapes industries, and augments human work rather than displaces it. In short, AI will be neither marginal nor dystopian.

“Our findings suggest that the continuation of the status quo, the basic expectation of most economists, is actually the least likely outcome,” Davis says. “We project that AI will have an even greater effect on productivity than the personal computer did. And we project that a scenario where AI transforms the economy is far more likely than one where AI disappoints and fiscal deficits dominate. The latter would likely lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation, and increased interest rates.”

Davis does not sugar-coat it, however. Although AI promises economic growth and productivity, it will be disruptive, especially for business leaders and workers in knowledge sectors. “AI is likely to be the most disruptive technology to alter the nature of our work since the personal computer,” says Davis. “Those of a certain age might recall how the broad availability of PCs remade many jobs. It didn’t eliminate jobs as much as it allowed people to focus on higher value activities.”

The team’s framework allowed them to examine AI automation risks to over 800 different occupations. The research indicated that while the potential for job loss exists in upwards of 20% of occupations as a result of AI-driven automation, the majority of jobs—likely four out of five—will result in a mixture of innovation and automation. Workers’ time will increasingly shift to higher value and uniquely human tasks.

This introduces the idea that AI could serve as a copilot to various roles, performing repetitive tasks and generally assisting with responsibilities. Davis argues that traditional economic models often underestimate the potential of AI because they fail to examine the deeper structural effects of technological change. “Most approaches for thinking about future growth, such as GDP, don’t adequately account for AI,” he explains. “They fail to link short-term variations in productivity with the three dimensions of technological change: automation, augmentation, and the emergence of new industries.” Automation enhances worker productivity by handling routine tasks; augmentation allows technology to act as a copilot, amplifying human skills; and the creation of new industries creates new sources of growth.

Ironically, Davis’s research suggests that a reason for the relatively low productivity growth in recent years may be a lack of automation. Despite a decade of rapid innovation in digital and automation technologies, productivity growth has lagged since the 2008 financial crisis, hitting 50-year lows. This appears to support the view that AI’s impact will be marginal. But Davis believes that automation has been adopted in the wrong places. “What surprised me most was how little automation there has been in services like finance, health care, and education,” he says. “Outside of manufacturing, automation has been very limited. That’s been holding back growth for at least two decades.” The services sector accounts for more than 60% of US GDP and 80% of the workforce and has experienced some of the lowest productivity growth. It is here, Davis argues, that AI will make the biggest difference.

One of the biggest challenges facing the economy is demographics, as the Baby Boomer generation retires, immigration slows, and birth rates decline. These demographic headwinds reinforce the need for technological acceleration. “There are concerns about AI being dystopian and causing massive job loss, but we’ll soon have too few workers, not too many,” Davis says. “Economies like the US, Japan, China, and those across Europe will need to step up function in automation as their populations age.”

For example, consider nursing, a profession in which empathy and human presence are irreplaceable. AI has already shown the potential to augment rather than automate in this field, streamlining data entry in electronic health records and helping nurses reclaim time for patient care. Davis estimates that these tools could increase nursing productivity by as much as 20% by 2035, a crucial gain as health-care systems adapt to ageing populations and rising demand. “In our most likely scenario, AI will offset demographic pressures. Within five to seven years, AI’s ability to automate portions of work will be roughly equivalent to adding 16 million to 17 million workers to the US labor force,” Davis says. “That’s essentially the same as if everyone turning 65 over the next five years decided not to retire.” He projects that more than 60% of occupations, including nurses, family physicians, high school teachers, pharmacists, human resource managers, and insurance sales agents, will benefit from AI as an augmentation tool.

As AI technology spreads, the strongest performers in the stock market won’t be its producers, but its users. “That makes sense, because general-purpose technologies enhance productivity, efficiency, and profitability across entire sectors,” says Davis. This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”

Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”

However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”

            <div id="article-text">Governments plan to pour $1.3 trillion into AI infrastructure by 2030 to invest in “sovereign AI,” with the premise being that countries should be in control of their own AI capabilities. The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines. This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine.

But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality. AI supply chains are irreducibly global: Chips are designed in the US and manufactured in East Asia; models are trained on data sets drawn from multiple countries; applications are deployed across dozens of jurisdictions.

If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from a defensive model of self-reliance to a vision that emphasizes the concept of orchestration, balancing national autonomy with strategic partnership.

Why infrastructure-first strategies hit walls

A November survey by Accenture found that 62% of European organizations are now seeking sovereign AI solutions, driven primarily by geopolitical anxiety rather than technical necessity. That figure rises to 80% in Denmark and 72% in Germany. The European Union has appointed its first Commissioner for Tech Sovereignty.

This year, $475 billion is flowing into AI data centers globally. In the United States, AI data centers accounted for roughly one-fifth of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025. But the obstacle for other nations hoping to follow suit isn’t just money. It’s energy and physics. Global data center capacity is projected to hit 130 gigawatts by 2030, and for every $1 billion spent on these facilities, $125 million is needed for electricity networks. More than $750 billion in planned investment is already facing grid delays.

And it’s also talent. Researchers and entrepreneurs are mobile, drawn to ecosystems with access to capital, competitive wages, and rapid innovation cycles. Infrastructure alone won’t attract or retain world-class talent.

What nations need isn’t sovereignty through isolation but through specialization and orchestration. This means choosing which capabilities you build, which you pursue through partnership, and where you can genuinely lead in shaping the global AI landscape.

The most successful AI strategies don’t try to replicate Silicon Valley; they identify specific advantages and build partnerships around them.

Singapore offers a model. Rather than seeking to duplicate massive infrastructure, it invested in governance frameworks, digital-identity platforms, and applications of AI in logistics and finance, areas where it can realistically compete.

Israel shows a different path. Its strength lies in a dense network of startups and military-adjacent research institutions delivering outsize influence despite the country’s small size.

South Korea is instructive too. While it has national champions like Samsung and Naver, these firms still partner with Microsoft and Nvidia on infrastructure. That’s deliberate collaboration reflecting strategic oversight, not dependence.

Even China, despite its scale and ambition, cannot secure full-stack autonomy. Its reliance on global research networks and on foreign lithography equipment, such as extreme ultraviolet systems needed to manufacture advanced chips and GPU architectures, shows the limits of techno-nationalism.

The pattern is clear: Nations that specialize and partner strategically can outperform those trying to do everything alone.

Three ways to align ambition with reality

Sovereignty isn’t how many petaflops you own. It’s how many lives you improve and how fast the economy grows. Real sovereignty is the ability to innovate in support of national priorities such as productivity, resilience, and sustainability while maintaining freedom to shape governance and standards.

Nations should track the use of AI in health care and monitor how the technology’s adoption correlates with manufacturing productivity, patent citations, and international research collaborations. The goal is to ensure that AI ecosystems generate inclusive and lasting economic and social value.

2. Cultivate a strong AI innovation ecosystem.

Build infrastructure, but also build the ecosystem around it: research institutions, technical education, entrepreneurship support, and public-private talent development. Infrastructure without skilled talent and vibrant networks cannot deliver a lasting competitive advantage.

Strategic partnerships enable nations to pool resources, lower infrastructure costs, and access complementary expertise. Singapore’s work with global cloud providers and the EU’s collaborative research programs show how nations advance capabilities faster through partnership than through isolation. Rather than competing to set dominant standards, nations should collaborate on interoperable frameworks for transparency, safety, and accountability.

Overinvesting in independence fragments markets and slows cross-border innovation, which is the foundation of AI progress. When strategies focus too narrowly on control, they sacrifice the agility needed to compete.

The cost of getting this wrong isn’t just wasted capital—it’s a decade of falling behind. Nations that double down on infrastructure-first strategies risk ending up with expensive data centers running yesterday’s models, while competitors that choose strategic partnerships iterate faster, attract better talent, and shape the standards that matter.

The winners will be those who define sovereignty not as separation, but as participation plus leadership—choosing who they depend on, where they build, and which global rules they shape. Strategic interdependence may feel less satisfying than independence, but it’s real, it is achievable, and it will separate the leaders from the followers over the next decade.

The age of intelligent systems demands intelligent strategies—ones that measure success not by infrastructure owned, but by problems solved. Nations that embrace this shift won’t just participate in the AI economy; they’ll shape it. That’s sovereignty worth pursuing.

At Davos this year Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild. The US president is due to speak here today, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance.

But Trump isn’t the only game in town—everyone’s also talking about AI. Read Mat’s story to find out more.

Thanks to genetic science, gene editing, and techniques like cloning, it’s now possible to move DNA through time, studying genetic information in ancient remains and then re-creating it in the bodies of modern beings. And that, scientists say, offers new ways to try to help endangered species, engineer new plants that resist climate change, or even create new human medicines.

Hello from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. I’ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI and Trump.

Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and the Wall Street Journal. Some houses are devoted to specific topics; for example, there’s one for science and another for AI.

But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everything I could see, in a spot where the road bends a bit, was a tech company house. Palantir, Workday, Infosys, Cloudflare, C3.ai. Maybe this should go without saying, but their presence, both in the houses and on the various stages and parties and platforms here at the World Economic Forum, really drove home to me how utterly and completely tech has captured the global economy.

While the houses host events and serve as networking hubs, the big show is inside the Congress Center. On Tuesday morning, I kicked off my official Davos experience there by moderating a panel with the CEOs of Accenture, Aramco, Royal Philips, and Visa. The topic was scaling up AI within organizations. All of these leaders represented companies that have gone from pilot projects to large internal implementations. It was, for me, a fascinating conversation. You can watch the whole thing here, but my takeaway was that while there are plenty of stories about AI being overhyped (including from us), it is certainly having substantive effects at large companies.

Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, for example, described how that company has found $3 billion to $5 billion in cost savings by improving the efficiency of its operations. Royal Philips CEO Roy Jakobs described how it was allowing health-care practitioners to spend more time with patients by doing things such as automated note-taking. (This really resonated with me, as my wife is a pediatrics nurse, and for decades now I’ve heard her talk about how much of her time is devoted to charting.) And Visa CEO Ryan McInerney talked about his company’s push into agentic commerce and the way that will play out for consumers, small businesses, and the global payments industry.

To elaborate a little on that point, McInerney painted a picture of commerce where agents won’t just shop for things you ask them to, which will be basically step one, but will eventually be able to shop for things based on your preferences and previous spending patterns. This could be your regular grocery shopping, or even a vacation getaway. That’s going to require a lot of trust and authentication to protect both merchants and consumers, but it is clear that the steps into agentic commerce we saw in 2025 were just baby ones. There are much bigger ones coming for 2026. (Coincidentally, I had a discussion with a senior executive from Mastercard on Monday, who made several of the same points.)

But the thing that really resonated with me from the panel was a comment from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who has a view not only of her own large org but across a spectrum of companies: “It’s hard to trust something until you understand it.”

I felt that neatly summed up where we are as a society with AI.

Clearly, other people feel the same. Before the official start of the conference I was at AI House for a panel. The place was packed. There was a consistent, massive line to get in, and once inside, I literally had to muscle my way through the crowd. Everyone wanted to get in. Everyone wanted to talk about AI.

(A quick aside on what I was doing there: I sat on a panel called “Creativity and Identity in the Age of Memes and Deepfakes,” led by Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson; it featured the artist Emi Kusano, who works with AI, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, who has been at the center of a lot of the debates about AI in the film and gaming industries. I’m not going to spend much time describing it because I’m already running long, but it was a rip-roarer of a panel. Check it out.)

The president is due here Wednesday, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance. While AI is all over the stages, Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild.

These conversations are also starting to spill out into the public. Just after my panel on Tuesday, I headed to a pavilion outside the main hall in the Congress Center. I saw someone coming down the stairs with a small entourage, who was suddenly mobbed by cameras and phones.

Moments earlier in the same spot, the press had been surrounding David Beckham, shouting questions at him. So I was primed for it to be another celebrity—after all, captains of industry were everywhere you looked. I mean, I had just bumped into Eric Schmidt, who was literally standing in line in front of me at the coffee bar. Davos is weird.

But in fact, it was Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who is increasingly seen as the leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, and a likely contender, or even front-runner, in the race to replace him. Because I live in San Francisco I’ve encountered Newsom many times, dating back to his early days as a city supervisor before he was even mayor. I’ve rarely, rarely, seen him quite so worked up as he was on Tuesday.

Among other things, he called Trump a narcissist who follows “the law of the jungle, the rule of Don” and compared him to a T-Rex, saying, “You mate with him or he devours you.” And he was just as harsh on the world leaders, many of whom are gathered in Davos, calling them “pathetic” and saying he should have brought knee pads for them.

There was more of this sentiment, if in more measured tones, from Canadian prime minister Mark Carney during his address at Davos. While I missed his remarks, they had people talking. “If we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he argued.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <h2>Reimagining ERP for the agentic AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1129965/reimagining-erp-for-the-agentic-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure.

The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.

Early indicators suggest that AI-enabled ERP will yield meaningful performance gains: One 2024 study found that organizations implementing AI-driven ERP solutions stand to gain around a 30% boost in user satisfaction and a 25% lift in productivity; another suggested that AI-driven ERP can lead to processing time savings of up to 45%, as well as improvements in decision accuracy to the tune of 60%.

These dual advancements address long-standing gaps that previous ERP eras fell short of delivering: freedom to innovate outside of vendor roadmaps, capacity for rapid iteration, and true interoperability across all critical functions. This shift signals the end of monolithic dependency as well as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for early movers to gain a competitive edge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are moving beyond coding assistants and customer service chatbots into the operational core of the enterprise. The ROI is promising, but autonomy without alignment is a recipe for chaos. Business leaders need to lay the essential foundations now.

Agents are independently handling end-to-end processes across lead generation, supply chain optimization, customer support, and financial reconciliation. A mid-sized organization could easily run 4,000 agents, each making decisions that affect revenue, compliance, and customer experience.

The transformation toward an agent-driven enterprise is inevitable. The economic benefits are too significant to ignore, and the potential is becoming a reality faster than most predicted. The problem? Most businesses and their underlying infrastructure are not prepared for this shift. Early adopters have found unlocking AI initiatives at scale to be extremely challenging.

Companies are investing heavily in AI, but the returns aren&#39;t materializing. According to recent research from Boston Consulting Group, 60% of companies report minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment. However, the leaders reported they achieved five times the revenue increases and three times the cost reductions. Clearly, there is a massive premium for being a leader.

What separates the leaders from the pack isn&#39;t how much they&#39;re spending or which models they&#39;re using. Before scaling AI deployment, these “future-built” companies put critical data infrastructure capabilities in place. They invested in the foundational work that enables AI to function reliably.

To understand how and where enterprise AI can fail, consider four critical quadrants: models, tools, context, and governance.

Take a simple example: an agent that orders you pizza. The model interprets your request (&quot;get me a pizza&quot;). The tool executes the action (calling the Domino&#39;s or Pizza Hut API). Context provides personalization (you tend to order pepperoni on Friday nights at 7pm). Governance validates the outcome (did the pizza actually arrive?).

Each dimension represents a potential failure point:

This framework helps diagnose where reliability gaps emerge. When an enterprise agent fails, which quadrant is the problem? Is the model misunderstanding intent? Are the tools unavailable or broken? Is the context incomplete or contradictory? Or is there no mechanism to verify that the agent did what it was supposed to do?

The temptation is to think that reliability will simply improve as models improve. Yet, model capability is advancing exponentially. The cost of inference has dropped nearly 900 times in three years, hallucination rates are on the decline, and AI’s capacity to perform long tasks doubles every six months.

Tooling is also accelerating. Integration frameworks like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) make it dramatically easier to connect agents with enterprise systems and APIs.

If models are powerful and tools are maturing, then what is holding back adoption?

To borrow from James Carville, “It is the data, stupid.” The root cause of most misbehaving agents is misaligned, inconsistent, or incomplete data.

Enterprises have accumulated data debt over decades. Acquisitions, custom systems, departmental tools, and shadow IT have left data scattered across silos that rarely agree. Support systems do not match what is in marketing systems. Supplier data is duplicated across finance, procurement, and logistics. Locations have multiple representations depending on the source.

Drop a few agents into this environment, and they will perform wonderfully at first, because each one is given a curated set of systems to call. Add more agents and the cracks grow, as each one builds its own fragment of truth.

This dynamic has played out before. When business intelligence became self-serve, everyone started creating dashboards. Productivity soared, reports failed to match. Now imagine that phenomenon not in static dashboards, but in AI agents that can take action. With agents, data inconsistency produces real business consequences, not just debates among departments.

Companies that build unified context and robust governance can deploy thousands of agents with confidence, knowing they&#39;ll work together coherently and comply with business rules. Companies that skip this foundational work will watch their agents produce contradictory results, violate policies, and ultimately erode trust faster than they create value.

The question for enterprises centers on organizational readiness. Will your company prepare the data foundation needed to make agent transformation work? Or will you spend years debugging agents, one issue at a time, forever chasing problems that originate in infrastructure you never built?

Autonomous agents are already transforming how work gets done. But the enterprise will only experience the upside if those systems operate from the same truth. This ensures that when agents reason, plan, and act, they do so based on accurate, consistent, and up-to-date information.

The companies generating value from AI today have built on fit-for-purpose data foundations. They recognized early that in an agentic world, data functions as essential infrastructure. A solid data foundation is what turns experimentation into dependable operations.

At Reltio, the focus is on building that foundation. The Reltio data management platform unifies core data from across the enterprise, giving every agent immediate access to the same business context. This unified approach enables enterprises to move faster, act smarter, and unlock the full value of AI.

Agents will define the future of the enterprise. Context intelligence will determine who leads it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.

            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.
