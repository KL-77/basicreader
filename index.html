            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">European security officials believe two Russian space vehicles have intercepted the communications of at least a dozen key satellites over the continent.

Officials believe that the likely interceptions, which have not previously been reported, risk not only compromising sensitive information transmitted by the satellites but could also allow Moscow to manipulate their trajectories or even crash them.

Russian space vehicles have shadowed European satellites more intensively over the past three years, at a time of high tension between the Kremlin and the West following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

For several years, military and civilian space authorities in the West have been tracking the activities of Luch-1 and Luch-2—two Russian objects that have carried out repeated suspicious maneuvers in orbit.

Both vehicles have made risky close approaches to some of Europe’s most important geostationary satellites, which operate high above the Earth and service the continent, including the UK, as well as large parts of Africa and the Middle East.

According to orbital data and ground-based telescopic observations, they have lingered nearby for weeks at a time, particularly over the past three years. Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has approached 17 European satellites.

Both satellites are suspected of “doing sigint [signals intelligence] business,” Major General Michael Traut, head of the German military’s space command, told the Financial Times, referring to the satellites’ practice of staying close to Western communications satellites.

A senior European intelligence official said the Luch vehicles were almost certainly intended to position themselves within the narrow cone of data beams transmitted from Earth-based stations to the satellites.

The official expressed concern that sensitive information—notably command data for European satellites—is unencrypted, because many were launched years ago without advanced onboard computers or encryption capabilities.

This leaves them vulnerable to future interference—or even destruction—once hostile actors have recorded their command data.

The maneuvers in space come as Russia steps up its “hybrid warfare” in Europe, including sabotage operations such as the severing of subsea Internet and power cables.

Intelligence and military officials are increasingly worried that the Kremlin could extend such disruptive activity into space, and is already developing the capability to do so.

While China and the US have developed similar technologies, Russia has one of the most advanced space-spying programs and has been more aggressive in its use of the vehicles to stalk satellites.

“Satellite networks are an Achilles heel of modern societies. Whoever attacks them can paralyze entire nations,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in a speech last September.

“The Russian activities are a fundamental threat to all of us, especially in space. A threat we must no longer ignore,” he added.

The European satellites approached by Luch 1 and 2 are primarily used for civilian purposes, such as satellite television, but also carry sensitive government and some military communications.

Luch 1 and Luch 2 are unlikely to have the capability to jam or destroy satellites themselves, the European intelligence official said. However, they have probably provided Russia with large amounts of data on how such systems could be disrupted, both from the ground and in orbit.

Maj. Gen. Traut said he presumed the Luch satellites had intercepted the “command link” of the satellites they approached—the channel linking satellites to ground controllers that allows orbital adjustments.

Analysts say that with such information, Russia could mimic ground operators, beaming false commands to satellites to manipulate their thrusters used for minor orbital adjustments.

Those thrusters could also be used to knock satellites out of alignment or even cause them to crash back to Earth or drift into space.

Intelligence gathered by Luch 1 and 2 could also help Russia coordinate less overt attacks on Western interests. Monitoring other satellites can reveal who is using them and where—information that could later be exploited for targeted ground-based jamming or hacking operations.

The Luch vehicles were “maneuvring about and parking themselves close to geostationary satellites, often for many months at a time,” said Belinda Marchand, chief science officer at Slingshot Aerospace, a US-based company that tracks objects in space using ground-based sensors and artificial intelligence.

She added that Luch 2 was currently “in proximity” to Intelsat 39, a large geostationary satellite that services Europe and Africa.

Since its launch in 2023, Luch-2 has hovered near at least 17 other geostationary satellites above Europe serving both commercial and government purposes, Slingshot data shows.

“They have visited the same families, the same operators—so you can deduce that they have a specific purpose or interest,” said Norbert Pouzin, senior orbital analyst at Aldoria, a French satellite tracking company that has also shadowed the Luch satellites. “These are all Nato-based operators.”

“Even if they cannot decrypt messages, they can still extract a lot of information… they can map how a satellite is being used, work out the location of ground terminals, for example,” he added.

Pouzin also said that Russia now seemed to be ramping up its reconnaissance activity in space, launching two new satellites last year named Cosmos 2589 and Cosmos 2590. The vehicles appear to have similarly maneuvrable capabilities to Luch-1 and Luch-2.

Cosmos 2589 is now on its way to the same range as geostationary satellites, which orbit 35,000 km above Earth, Pouzin said.

But Luch-1 may no longer be functional. On January 30, Earth telescopes observed what appeared to be a plume of gas coming from the satellite. Shortly after, it appeared to at least partially fragment.

“It looks like it began with something to do with the propulsion,” said Marchand, adding that afterwards there “was certainly a fragmentation,” and the satellite was “still tumbling.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Space Launch System rocket program is now a decade and a half old, and it continues to be dominated by two unfortunate traits: It is expensive, and it is slow.

The massive rocket and its convoluted ground systems, so necessary to baby and cajole the booster’s prickly hydrogen propellant on board, have cost US taxpayers in excess of $30 billion to date. And even as it reaches maturity, the rocket is going nowhere fast.

You remember the last time NASA tried to launch the world’s largest orange rocket, right? The space agency rolled the Space Launch System out of its hangar in March 2022. The first, second, and thirds attempts at a wet dress rehearsal—elaborate fueling tests—were scrubbed. The SLS rocket was slowly rolled back to its hangar for work in April before returning to the pad in June.

The fourth fueling test also ended early but this time reached to within 29 seconds of when the engines would ignite. This was not all the way to the planned T-9.3 seconds, a previously established gate to launch the vehicle. Nevertheless mission managers had evidently had enough of failed fueling tests. Accordingly, they proceeded into final launch preparations.

The first launch attempt (effectively the fifth wet-dress test), in late August, was scrubbed due to hydrogen leaks and other problems. A second attempt, a week later, also succumbed to hydrogen leaks. Finally, on the next attempt, and seventh overall try at fully fueling and nursing this vehicle through a countdown, the Space Launch System rocket actually took off. After doing so, it flew splendidly.

That was November 22, 2022. More than three years ago. You might think that over the course of the extended interval since then, and after the excruciating pain of spending nearly an entire year conducting fueling tests to try to lift the massive rocket off the pad, some of the smartest engineers in the world, the fine men and women at NASA, would have dug into and solved the leak issues.

On Monday, after rolling the SLS rocket to be used for the Artemis II mission to the pad in January, NASA attempted its first wet-dress test with this new vehicle. At one of the main interfaces where liquid hydrogen enters the vehicle, a leak developed, not dissimilar to problems that occurred with the Artemis I rocket three years ago.

NASA has developed several ploys to mitigate the leak. These include varying the rate of hydrogen, which is very cold, flowing into the vehicle. At times they also stopped this flow, hoping the seals at the interface between the ground equipment and the rocket would warm up and “re-seat,” thereby halting the leaks. It worked—sort of. After several hours of troubleshooting, the vehicle was fully loaded. Finally, running about four hours late on their timeline, the dogged countdown team at Kennedy Space Center pushed toward the last stages of the countdown.

However, at this critical time, the liquid hydrogen leak rate spiked once again. This led to an automatic abort of the test a little before T-5 minutes. And so ended NASA’s hopes of launching the much-anticipated Artemis II mission, sending four astronauts around the Moon, in February. NASA will now attempt to launch the vehicle no earlier than March following more wet-dress attempts in the interim.

In a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, NASA officials were asked why they had not solved a problem that was so nettlesome during the Artemis I launch campaign.

“After Artemis I, with the challenges we had with the leaks, we took a pretty aggressive approach to do some component-level testing with some of these valves and the seals, and try to understand their behavior,” said John Honeycutt, chair of the Artemis II Mission Management Team. “And so we got a good handle on that relative to how we install the flight-side and the ground-side interface. But on the ground we’re pretty limited in how much realism we can put into the test. We try to test like we fly, but this interface is a very complex interface. When you’re dealing with hydrogen it’s a small molecule. It’s highly energetic. We like it for that reason. And we do the best we can.”

If NASA were really going to do the best it could with this rocket, there were options in the last three years. It is common in commercial rocketry to build one or more “test” tanks to both stress the hardware as well as ensure its compatibility with ground systems through an extensive test campaign. However, SLS hardware is extraordinarily expensive. A single rocket costs in excess of $2 billion, so the program is hardware-poor. Moreover, tanking tests might have caused damage to the launch tower, which itself cost in excess of $1 billion. As far as I know, there was never any serious discussion of building a test tank.

Hardware scarcity, due to cost, is but one of several problems with the SLS rocket architecture. Probably the biggest one is its extremely low flight rate, which makes every fueling and launch opportunity an experimental rather than operational procedure. This has been pointed out to NASA, and the rocket’s benefactors in Congress, for more than a decade. A rocket that is so expensive it only flies rarely will have super-high operating costs and ever-present safety concerns precisely because it flies so infrequently.

Until this week NASA had largely ignored these concerns, at least in public. However, in a stunning admission, NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, acknowledged the flight-rate issue after Monday’s wet-dress rehearsal test failed to reach a successful conclusion. “The flight rate is the lowest of any NASA-designed vehicle, and that should be a topic of discussion,” he said as part of a longer post about the test on social media.

The reality, which Isaacman knows full well, and which almost everyone else in the industry recognizes, is that the SLS rocket is dead hardware walking. The Trump administration would like to fly the rocket just two more times, culminating in the Artemis III human landing on the Moon. Congress has passed legislation mandating a fourth and fifth launch of the SLS vehicle.

However, one gets the sense that this battle is not yet fully formed, and the outcome will depend on hiccups like Monday’s aborted test; the ongoing performance of the rocket in flight; and how quickly SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicle make advancements toward reliability. Both of these private rockets are moving at light speed relative to NASA’s Slow Launch System.

During the news conference I asked about this low flight rate and the challenge of managing a complex rocket that will never be more than anything but an experimental system. The answer from NASA’s top civil servant, Amit Kshatriya, was eye-opening.

“You know, you’re right, the flight rate—three years is a long time between the first and second,” NASA’s associate administrator said. “It is going to be experimental, because of going to the Moon in this configuration, with the energies we’re dealing with. And every time we do it these are very bespoke components, they’re in many cases made by incredible craftsmen. … It’s the first time this particular machine has borne witness to cryogens, and how it breathes, and how it vents, and how it wants to leak is something we have to characterize. And so every time we do it, we’re going to have to do that separately.”

So there you have it. Every SLS rocket is a work of art, every launch campaign an adventure, every mission subject to excessive delays. It’s definitely not ideal.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I know, I know—these days, that sounds like an excuse. Anyone can code, right?! Grab some tutorials, maybe an O’Reilly book, download an example project, and jump in. It’s just a matter of learning how to break your project into small steps that you can make the computer do, then memorizing a bit of syntax. Nothing about that is hard!

Perhaps you can sense my sarcasm (and sympathize with my lack of time to learn one more technical skill).

Oh, sure, I can “code.” That is, I can flail my way through a block of (relatively simple) pseudocode and follow the flow. I have a reasonably technical layperson’s understanding of conditionals and loops, and of when one might use a variable versus a constant. On a good day, I could probably even tell you what a “pointer” is.

But pulling all that knowledge together and synthesizing a working application any more complex than “hello world”? I am not that guy. And at this point, I’ve lost the neuroplasticity and the motivation (if I ever had either) to become that guy.

Thanks to AI, though, what has been true for my whole life need not be true anymore. Perhaps, like my colleague Benj Edwards, I can whistle up an LLM or two and tackle the creaky pile of “it’d be neat if I had a program that would do X” projects without being publicly excoriated on StackOverflow by apex predator geeks for daring to sully their holy temple of knowledge with my dirty, stupid, off-topic, already-answered questions.

My project is a small Python-based log colorizer that I asked Claude Code to construct for me. If you’d like to peek at the code before listening to me babble, a version of the project without some of the Lee-specific customizations is available on GitHub.

Why a log colorizer? Two reasons. First, and most important to me, because I needed to look through a big ol’ pile of web server logs, and off-the-shelf colorizer solutions weren’t customizable to the degree I wanted. Vibe-coding one that exactly matched my needs made me happy.

But second, and almost equally important, is that this was a small project. The colorizer ended up being a 400-ish line, single-file Python script. The entire codebase, plus the prompting and follow-up instructions, fit easily within Claude Code’s context window. This isn’t an application that sprawls across dozens or hundreds of functions in multiple files, making it easy to audit (even for me).

Setting the stage: I do the web hosting for my colleague Eric Berger’s Houston-area forecasting site, Space City Weather. It’s a self-hosted WordPress site, running on an AWS EC2 t3a.large instance, fronted by Cloudflare using CF’s WordPress Automatic Platform Optimization.

Space City Weather also uses self-hosted Discourse for commenting, replacing WordPress’ native comments at the bottom of Eric’s daily weather posts via the WP-Discourse plugin. Since bolting Discourse onto the site back in August 2025, though, I’ve had an intermittent issue where sometimes—but not all the time—a daily forecast post would go live and get cached by Cloudflare with the old, disabled native WordPress comment area attached to the bottom instead of the shiny new Discourse comment area. Hundreds of visitors would then see a version of the post without a functional comment system until I manually expired the stale page or until the page hit Cloudflare’s APO-enforced max age and expired itself.

The problem behavior would lie dormant for weeks or months, and then we’d get a string of back-to-back days where it would rear its ugly head. Edge cache invalidation on new posts is supposed to be triggered automatically by the official Cloudflare WordPress plug-in, and indeed, it usually worked fine—but “usually” is not “always.”

In the absence of any obvious clues as to why this was happening, I consulted a few different LLMs and asked for possible fixes. The solution I settled on was having one of them author a small mu-plugin in PHP (more vibe coding!) that forces WordPress to slap “DO NOT CACHE ME!” headers on post pages until it has verified that Discourse has hooked its comments to the post. (Curious readers can put eyes on this plugin right here.)

This “solved” the problem by preempting the problem behavior, but it did nothing to help me identify or fix the actual underlying issue. I turned my attention elsewhere for a few months. One day in December, as I was updating things, I decided to temporarily disable the mu-plugin to see if I still needed it. After all, problems sometimes go away on their own, right? Computers are crazy!

Alas, the next time Eric made a Space City Weather post, it popped up sans Discourse comment section, with the (ostensibly disabled) WordPress comment form at the bottom. Clearly, the problem behavior was still in play.

Have you ever been stuck troubleshooting an intermittent issue? Something doesn’t work, you make a change, it suddenly starts working, then despite making no further changes, it randomly breaks again.

The process makes you question basic assumptions, like, “Do I actually know how to use a computer?” You feel like you might be actually-for-real losing your mind. The final stage of this process is the all-consuming death spiral, where you start asking stuff like, “Do I need to troubleshoot my troubleshooting methods? Is my server even working? Is the simulation we’re all living in finally breaking down and reality itself is toying with me?!”

In this case, I couldn’t reproduce the problem behavior on demand, no matter how many tests I tried. I couldn’t see any narrow, definable commonalities between days where things worked fine and days where things broke.

My best hope for getting a handle on the problem likely lay deeply buried in the server’s logs. Like any good sysadmin, I gave the logs a quick once-over for problems a couple of times per month, but Space City Weather is a reasonably busy medium-sized site and dishes out its daily forecast to between 20,000 and 30,000 people (“unique visitors” in web parlance, or “UVs” if you want to sound cool). Even with Cloudflare taking the brunt of the traffic, the daily web server log files are, let us say, “a bit dense.” My surface-level glances weren’t doing the trick—I’d have to actually dig in. And having been down this road before for other issues, I knew I needed more help than grep alone could provide.

The Space City Weather web server uses Nginx for actual web serving. For folks who have never had the pleasure, Nginx, as configured in most of its distributable packages, keeps a pair of log files around—one that shows every request serviced and another just for errors.

I wanted to watch the access log right when Eric was posting to see if anything obviously dumb/bad/wrong/broken was happening. But I’m not super-great at staring at a giant wall of text and symbols, and I tend to lean heavily on syntax highlighting and colorization to pick out the important bits when I’m searching through log files. There’s an old and crusty program called ccze that’s easily findable in most repos; I’ve used it forever, and if its default output does what you need, then it’s an excellent tool.

But customizing ccze’s output is a “here be dragons”-type task. The application is old, and time has ossified it into something like an unapproachably evil Mayan relic, filled with shadowy regexes and dark magic, fit to be worshipped from afar but not trifled with. Altering ccze’s behavior threatens to become an effort-swallowing bottomless pit, where you spend more time screwing around with the tool and the regexes than you actually spend using the tool to diagnose your original problem.

It was time to fire up VSCode and pretend to be a developer. I set up a new project, performed the demonic invocation to summon Claude Code, flipped the thing into “plan mode,” and began.

“I’d like to see about creating an Nginx log colorizer,” I wrote in the prompt box. “I don’t know what language we should use. I would like to prioritize efficiency and performance in the code, as I will be running this live in production and I can’t have it adding any applicable load.” I dropped a truncated, IP-address-sanitized copy of yesterday’s Nginx access.log into the project directory.

“See the access.log file in the project directory as an example of the data we’ll be colorizing. You can test using that file,” I wrote.

Ever helpful, Claude Code chewed on the prompt and the example data for a few seconds, then began spitting output. It suggested Python for our log colorizer because of the language’s mature regex support—and to keep the code somewhat readable for poor, dumb me. The actual “vibe-coding” wound up spanning two sessions over two days, as I exhausted my Claude Code credits on the first one (a definite vibe-coding danger!) and had to wait for things to reset.

Yes, yes, a log colorizer is bougie and lame, and I’m treading over exceedingly well-trodden ground. I did, in fact, sit for a bit with existing tools—particularly lnav, which does most of what I want. But I didn’t want most of my requirements met. I wanted all of them. I wanted a bespoke tool, and I wanted it without having to pay the “is it worth the time?” penalty. (Or, perhaps, I wanted to feel like the LLM’s time was being wasted rather than mine, given that the effort ultimately took two days of vibe-coding.)

And about those two days: Getting a basic colorizer coded and working took maybe 10 minutes and perhaps two rounds of prompts. It was super-easy. Where I burned the majority of the time and compute power was in tweaking the initial result to be exactly what I wanted.

For therein lies the truly seductive part of vibe-coding—the ease of asking the LLM to make small changes or improvements and the apparent absence of cost or consequence for implementing those changes. The impression is that you’re on the Enterprise-D, chatting with the ship’s computer, collaboratively solving a problem with Geordi and Data standing right behind you. It’s downright intoxicating to say, “Hm, yes, now let’s make it so I can show only IPv4 or IPv6 clients with a command line switch,” and the machine does it. (It’s even cooler if you make the request while swinging your leg over the back of a chair so you can sit in it Riker-style!)

It’s exhilarating, honestly, in an Emperor Palpatine “UNLIMITED POWERRRRR!” kind of way. It removes a barrier that I didn’t think would ever be removed—or, rather, one I thought I would never have the time, motivation, or ability to tear down myself.

In the end, after a couple of days of testing and iteration—including a couple of “Is this colorizer performant, and will it introduce system load if run in production?” back-n-forth exchanges where the LLM reduced the cost of our regex matching and ensured our main loop wasn’t very heavy, I got a tool that does exactly what I want.

Specifically, I now have a log colorizer that:

…and, worth repeating, it all looks exactly how I want it to look and behaves exactly how I want it to behave. Here’s another action shot!

Armed with my handy-dandy log colorizer, I patiently waited for the wrong-comment-area problem behavior to re-rear its still-ugly head. I did not have to wait long, and within a couple of days, I had my root cause. It had been there all along, if I’d only decided to spend some time looking for it. Here it is:

Briefly: The problem is Apple’s fault. (Well, not really. But kinda.)

Less briefly: I’ve blurred out Eric’s IP address, but it’s dark green, so any place in the above image where you see a blurry, dark green smudge, that’s Eric. In the roughly 12-ish seconds presented here, you’re seeing Eric press the “publish” button on his daily forecast—that’s the “POST” event at the very top of the window. The subsequent events from Eric’s IP address are his browser having the standard post-publication conversation with WordPress so it can display the “post published successfully” notification and then redraw the WP block editor.

Below Eric’s post, you can see the Discourse server (with orange IP address) notifying WordPress that it has created a new Discourse comment thread for Eric’s post, then grabbing the things it needs to mirror Eric’s post as the opener for that thread. You can see it does GETs for the actual post and also for the post’s embedded images. About one second after Eric hits “publish,” the new post’s Discourse thread is ready, and it gets attached to Eric’s post.

Ah, but notice what else happens during that one second.

To help expand Space City Weather’s reach, we cross-publish all of the site’s posts to Apple News, using a popular Apple News plug-in (the same one Ars uses, in fact). And right there, with those two GET requests immediately after Eric’s POST request, lay the problem: You’re seeing the vanguard of Apple News’ hungry army of story-retrieval bots, summoned by the same “publish” event, charging in and demanding a copy of the brand new post before Discourse has a chance to do its thing.

It was a classic problem in computing: a race condition. Most days, Discourse’s new thread creation would beat the AppleNewsBot rush; some days, though, it wouldn’t. On the days when it didn’t, the horde of Apple bots would demand the page before its Discourse comments were attached, and Cloudflare would happily cache what those bots got served.

I knew my fix of emitting “NO CACHE” headers on the story pages prior to Discourse attaching comments worked, but now I knew why it worked—and why the problem existed in the first place. And oh, dear reader, is there anything quite so viscerally satisfying in all the world as figuring out the “why” behind a long-running problem?

But then, just as Icarus became so entranced by the miracle of flight that he lost his common sense, I too forgot I soared on wax-wrought wings, and flew too close to the sun.

I think we all knew I’d get here eventually—to the inevitable third act turn, where the center cannot hold, and things fall apart. If you read Benj’s latest experience with agentic-based vibe coding—or if you’ve tried it yourself—then what I’m about to say will probably sound painfully obvious, but it is nonetheless time to say it.

Despite their capabilities, LLM coding agents are not smart. They also are not dumb. They are agents without agency—mindless engines whose purpose is to complete the prompt, and that is all.

What this means is that, if you let them, Claude Code (and OpenAI Codex and all the other agentic coding LLMs) will happily spin their wheels for hours hammering on a solution that can’t ever actually work, so long as their efforts match the prompt. It’s on you to accurately scope your problem. You must articulate what you want in plain and specific domain-appropriate language, because the LLM cannot and will not properly intuit anything you leave unsaid. And having done that, you must then spot and redirect the LLM away from traps and dead ends. Otherwise, it will guess at what you want based on the alignment of a bunch of n-dimensional curves and vectors in high-order phase space, and it might guess right—but it also very much might not.

So I had my log colorizer, and I’d found my problem. I’d also found, after leaving the colorizer up in a window tailing the web server logs in real time, all kinds of things that my previous behavior of occasionally glancing at the logs wasn’t revealing. Ooh, look, there’s a rest route that should probably be blocked from the outside world! Ooh, look, there’s a web crawler I need to feed into Cloudflare’s WAF wood-chipper because it’s ignoring robots.txt! Ooh, look, here’s an area where I can tweak my fastcgi cache settings and eke out a slightly better hit rate!

But here’s the thing with the joy of problem-solving: Like all joy, its source is finite. The joy comes from the solving itself, and even when all my problems are solved and the systems are all working great, I still crave more joy. It is in my nature to therefore invent new problems to solve.

I decided that the problem I wanted to solve next was figuring out a way for my log colorizer to display its output without wrapping long lines—because wrapped lines throw off the neatly delimited columns of log data. I would instead prefer that my terminal window sprout a horizontal scroll bar when needed, and if I wanted to see the full extent of a long line, I could grab the scroll bar and investigate.

Astute readers will at this point notice two things: first, that now I really was reinventing lnav, except way worse and way dumber. Second, and more importantly, line-wrapping behavior is properly a function of the terminal application, not the data being displayed within it, and my approach was misguided from first principles. (This is in fact exactly the kind of request that can and should be slapped down on StackOverflow—and, indeed, searching there shows many examples of this exact thing happening.)

But the lure of telling the machine what to do and then watching the machine weave my words into functional magic was too strong—surely we could code our way out of this problem! With LLMs, we can code our way out of any problem! Right?

Eventually, after much refining of requirements, Claude produced what I asked it to produce: a separate Python script, which accepted piped input and created, like, a viewport or something—I don’t know, I can’t code, remember?—and within that viewport, I could scroll around. It seemed to work great!

Problems became apparent when I actually tried scrolling around for more than a short distance—and by “problems,” I mean “my web server’s CPU lit up like a Christmas tree on fire.”

“Issue,” I told the LLM. “When horizontal scrolling happens, the log wrapper takes up almost 100 percent of a host CPU core. Can we assess how to make this a zero-CPU-impact tool?”

“This tool has to parse ANSI, slice lines, and repaint when you scroll,” it replied in what I imagined was an arch, droll tone. “The bottleneck is screen redraw + full-width scan of all lines on every new line or key repeat. Each new line triggers a full screen redraw of term_height lines, plus visible_width() over the entire buffer. Holding the arrow key generates rapid repeats, each doing a full redraw and slice of every line.”

“Zero-CPU isn’t achievable,” continued the LLM, “but there are low-impact approaches.”

My crest lifted a bit, and we dug in—but the LLM was perhaps a bit optimistic about those “low-impact approaches.” We burned several more days’ worth of tokens on performance improvements—none of which I had any realistic input on because at this point we were way, way past my ability to flail through the Python code and understand what the LLM was doing. Eventually, we hit a wall.

Instead of throwing in the towel, I vibed on, because the sunk cost fallacy is for other people. I instructed the LLM to shift directions and help me run the log display script locally, so my desktop machine with all its many cores and CPU cycles to spare would be the one shouldering the reflow/redraw burden and not the web server.

Rather than drag this tale on for any longer, I’ll simply enlist Ars Creative Director Aurich Lawson’s skills to present the story of how this worked out in the form of a fun collage, showing my increasingly unhinged prompting of the LLM to solve the new problems that appeared when trying to get a script to run on ssh output when key auth and sudo are in play:

So, thwarted in my attempts to do exactly what I wanted in exactly the way I wanted, I took my log colorizer and went home. (The failed log display script is also up on GitHub with the colorizer if anyone wants to point and laugh at my efforts. Is the code good? Who knows?! Not me!) I’d scored my big win and found my problem root cause, and that would have to be enough for me—for now, at least.

As to that “big win&quot;—finally managing a root-cause analysis of my WordPress-Discourse-Cloudflare caching issue—I also recognize that I probably didn’t need a vibe-coded log colorizer to get there. The evidence was already waiting to be discovered in the Nginx logs, whether or not it was presented to me wrapped in fancy colors. Did I, in fact, use the thrill of vibe coding a tool to Tom Sawyer myself into doing the log searches? (“Wow, self, look at this new cool log colorizer! Bet you could use that to solve all kinds of problems! Yeah, self, you’re right! Let’s do it!”) Very probably. I know how to motivate myself, and sometimes starting a task requires some mental trickery.

This round of vibe coding and its muddled finale reinforced my personal assessment of LLMs—an assessment that hasn’t changed much with the addition of agentic abilities to the toolkit.

LLMs can be fantastic if you’re using them to do something that you mostly understand. If you’re familiar enough with a problem space to understand the common approaches used to solve it, and you know the subject area well enough to spot the inevitable LLM hallucinations and confabulations, and you understand the task at hand well enough to steer the LLM away from dead-ends and to stop it from re-inventing the wheel, and you have the means to confirm the LLM’s output, then these tools are, frankly, kind of amazing.

But the moment you step outside of your area of specialization and begin using them for tasks you don’t mostly understand, or if you’re not familiar enough with the problem to spot bad solutions, or if you can’t check its output, then oh, dear reader, may God have mercy on your soul. And on your poor project, because it’s going to be a mess.

These tools as they exist today can help you if you already have competence. They cannot give you that competence. At best, they can give you a dangerous illusion of mastery; at worst, well, who even knows? Lost data, leaked PII, wasted time, possible legal exposure if the project is big enough—the “worst” list goes on and on!

The log colorizer is not the first nor the last bit of vibe coding I’ve indulged in. While I’m not as prolific as Benj, over the past couple of months, I’ve turned LLMs loose on a stack of coding tasks that needed doing but that I couldn’t do myself—often in direct contravention of my own advice above about being careful to use them only in areas where you already have some competence. I’ve had the thing make small WordPress PHP plugins, regexes, bash scripts, and my current crowning achievement: a save editor for an old MS-DOS game (in both Python and Swift, no less!) And I had fun doing these things, even as entire vast swaths of rainforest were lit on fire to power my agentic adventures.

As someone employed in a creative field, I’m appropriately nervous about LLMs, but for me, it’s time to face reality. An overwhelming majority of developers say they’re using AI tools in some capacity. It’s a safer career move at this point, almost regardless of one’s field, to be more familiar with them than unfamiliar with them. The genie is not going back into the lamp—it’s too busy granting wishes.

I don’t want y’all to think I feel doomy-gloomy over the genie, either, because I’m right there with everyone else, shouting my wishes at the damn thing. I am a better sysadmin than I was before agentic coding because now I can solve problems myself that I would have previously needed to hand off to someone else. Despite the problems, there is real value there,  both personally and professionally. In fact, using an agentic LLM to solve a tightly constrained programming problem that I couldn’t otherwise solve is genuinely fun.

And when screwing around with computers stops being fun, that’s when I’ll know I’ve truly become old.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/netflix-claims-subscribers-will-get-more-content-for-less-if-it-buys-hbo-max/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There is concern that subscribers might be negatively affected if Netflix acquires Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD’s) streaming and movie studios businesses. One of the biggest fears is that the merger would lead to higher prices due to less competition for Netflix. During a Senate hearing today, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos suggested that the merger would have an opposite effect.

Sarandos was speaking at a hearing held by the US Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, “Examining the Competitive Impact of the Proposed Netflix-Warner Brothers Transaction.”

Sarandos aimed to convince the subcommittee that Netflix wouldn’t become a monopoly in streaming or in movie and TV production if regulators allowed its acquisition to close. Netflix is the largest subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider by subscribers (301.63 million as of January 2025), and WBD is the third (128 million streaming subscribers, including users of HBO Max and, to a smaller degree, Discovery+).

Speaking at today’s hearing, Sarandos said:

Netflix and Warner Bros. both have streaming services, but they are very complementary. In fact, 80 percent of HBO Max subscribers also subscribe to Netflix. We will give consumers more content for less.

During the hearing, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked Sarandos how Netflix can ensure that streaming remains “affordable” after a merger, especially after Netflix issued a price hike in January 2025 despite adding more subscribers.

Sarandos said the streaming industry is still competitive. The executive claimed that previous Netflix price hikes have come with “a lot more value” for subscribers.

“We are a one-click cancel, so if the consumer says, ‘That’s too much for what I’m getting,’ they can cancel with one click,” Sarandos said.

When pressed further on pricing, the executive argued that the merger doesn’t pose “any concentration risk” and that Netflix is working with the US Department of Justice on potential guardrails against more price hikes.

Sarandos claimed that the merger would “create more value for consumers.” However, his idea of value isn’t just about how much subscribers pay to stream but about content quality. By his calculations, which he provided without further details, Netflix subscribers spend an average of 35 cents per hour of content watched, compared to 90 cents for Paramount+. The Netflix stat is similar to one provided by MoffettNathanson in January 2025, finding that in the prior quarter, on average, Netflix generated 34 cents in subscription fees per hour of content viewed per subscriber. At the time, the research firm said Paramount+ made an average of 76 cents per hour of content viewed per subscriber.

Netflix views WBD as “both a competitor and a supplier,” Sarandos said when subcommittee chair Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) asked why Netflix wants to buy WB’s film studios, per Variety. The streaming executive claimed that Netflix’s “history is about adding more and more” content and choice.

During the hearing, Sarandos argued that streaming is a competitive business and pointed to Google, Apple, and Amazon as “deep-pocketed tech companies trying to run away with the TV business.” He tried to downplay concerns that Netflix could become a monopoly by emphasizing YouTube’s high TV viewership. Nielsen’s The Gauge tracker shows which platforms Americans use most when using their TVs (as opposed to laptops, tablets, or other devices). In December, it said that YouTube, not including YouTube TV, had more TV viewership (12.7 percent) than any other SVOD service, including second-place Netflix (9 percent). Sarandos claimed that Netflix would have 21 percent of the SVOD market if it merged with HBO Max.

We’re in the midst of what’s expected to be a long series of arguments as Netflix and Paramount Skydance attempt to own WBD’s assets. In the most recent developments, Netflix amended its $72 billion offer to be all-cash. Netflix is looking to buy HBO Max and WB’s film studios for $27.75 per share, or an enterprise value of $82.7 billion. Paramount is seeking a hostile takeover and has sued WBD over its Netflix deal. It has offered $108.4 billion at $30 per share for all of WBD, including its cable channels.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, Apple TV released a teaser for the second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, part of Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse, which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters (kaiju) created by Toho Co., Ltd into a shared narrative. But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: It’s a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it.

As previously reported, the first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues. Per the official Season 2 premise:

Season two will pick up with the fate of Monarch—and the world—hanging in the balance. The dramatic saga reveals buried secrets that reunite our heroes (and villains) on Kong’s Skull Island, and a new, mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. The ripple effects of the past make waves in the present day, blurring the bonds between family, friend and foe—all with the threat of a titan event on the horizon.

In addition to Russell, returning cast members include Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt) as the younger Shaw; Anna Sawai as Cate Randa; Kiersey Clemons as May; Ren Watabe as Kentaro Randa; Joe Tippett as Tim; Elisa Lasowski as Duvall; and Anders Holm playing the younger version of Monarch researcher Bill Randa. Takehiro Hira, Amber Midthunder, Curtiss Cook, Cliff Curtis, Dominique Tipper, and Camilo Jiménez Varón will join the S2 cast as guest stars.

The full trailer opens with our plucky team realizing that whatever kaiju is causing the latest havoc isn’t Kong, or Godzilla, but something even bigger. And it has massive tentacles that the kaiju uses to wrap around a manned boat and drag it down to the ocean depths. Cate blames herself for pressing the button that opened the rift, thereby unleashing this new menace on humankind. Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk, so our only hope is to call on Kong and Godzilla, according to Shaw, because “to destroy a monster takes another monster.” But they might just make things worse. At least we get to see a roaring Kong deliver a powerful punch to the new Titan’s face.

The second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters premieres on Apple TV on February 27, 2026. New episodes will be released every Friday through May 1, 2026. And the MonsterVerse is still expanding: Apple TV recently greenlit a spinoff prequel series featuring Wyatt Russell’s younger Shaw, set during the Cold War.

            <h2>Nvidia's $100 billion OpenAI deal has seemingly vanished</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/five-months-later-nvidias-100-billion-openai-investment-plan-has-fizzled-out/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details “in the coming weeks.” Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia’s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was “never a commitment,” and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.

Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI’s Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex’s performance limitations to Nvidia’s GPU-based hardware.

After the Reuters story published and Nvidia’s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

The September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia’s total GPU shipments for the year. “This is a giant project,” Huang said.

But the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he told reporters in Taiwan that the $100 billion was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest “up to” that amount and that Nvidia would “invest one step at a time.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” Huang said. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”

A Wall Street Journal report on Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI’s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims “nonsense.”

Nvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC that the back-and-forth was unusual. “One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn’t a strong ‘It will be $100 billion.’ It was, ‘It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.’ And so I do think there are some question marks there.”

In September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of such investments to CNBC. “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Talkington said. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.”

Tech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia’s circular investments for some time, which touch dozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.

“NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,” Zitron wrote on Bluesky last September, “even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.”

Outside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with other senior leaders, as part of the arrangement.

In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.

But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for 6 gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI companies are looking to spend trillions of dollars on data centers to power their increasingly resource-intensive AI models — an astronomical amount of money that could threaten the entire economy if the bet doesn’t pay off.

As the race to spend as much money as possible on AI infrastructure rages on, companies have become increasingly desperate to keep the cash flowing. Firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Oracle are exhausting existing debt markets — including junk debt, private credit, and asset-backed loans — in increasingly desperate moves, as Bloomberg reports, that are raising concerns among investors.

“The numbers are like nothing any of us who have been in this business for 25 years have seen,” Bank of America managing head of global credit Matt McQueen told Bloomberg. “You have to turn over all avenues to make this work.”

AI companies have accrued at least $200 billion in debt, per the publication. A more realistic figure is likely considerably higher, as that estimate doesn’t count undisclosed private deals.

Oracle announced over the weekend that it’s raising a staggering $45 billion to $50 billion in debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, plans that once again highlighted persistent concerns over a growing AI bubble. The company’s efforts to build out AI data centers have firmly pushed the company into a negative cash flow, leaving it on the hook for many billions of dollars in the coming years.

Elon Musk’s plans to merge his space company SpaceX with xAI ahead of a rumored blockbuster IPO are also raising eyebrows, suggesting the billionaire’s nascent AI startup is looking to secure even more funds for highly ambitious plans including sending data centers to space.

Despite the mounting capital expenditures, the industry still has a lot of work left to do to justify its heavy borrowing. Many AI companies have essentially given up on even pretending their short- or medium-term goal is to make money as they turn to measuring “ambition, not success,” as TechCrunch AI editor Russell Brandom explained in a recent piece.

The tech itself is also starting to show diminishing returns with each new model release. Even the most powerful AI models are still struggling with the very basics, while suffering from the same drawbacks, including persistent hallucinations, that have plagued them for years now.

Demand could also be drying up, making it even harder to justify all of that debt. Early data suggests that subscriber growth for online services, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, could already be levelling off. Meanwhile, OpenAI has already turned to stuffing ads into its services in a desperate bid to stem the bleeding, a move that CEO Sam Altman called a “last resort” as recently as 2024.

The short-term prognosis is starting to look grim. A growing mountain of debt could add significantly to borrowing costs, making AI data centers an even more expensive endeavor for already cash-strapped AI companies.

At least for now, investors are still seeing dollar signs — though many are also fretting that it’s only a matter of time until the bubble pops.

“There’s a view that if you can build a data center, there’s so much demand for data centers that you just can’t lose — it’s like selling beer to sailors,” SLC Management co-head of private fixed income Andrew Kleeman told Bloomberg. “But anytime there’s truly innovative technology, there’s usually a massive overinvestment, and then there’s a correction.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last weekend, a China Central Television YouTube channel shared a video showing off some recent developments in autonomous aerial vehicles. There were plenty of quotidian craft on display, like the Wing Loong II Long Range Drone and the Lanying R6000 Tiltrotor — remarkable achievements for a nation barely a century removed from semi-feudal rule to be sure, but not exactly breaking news.

One segment of the video, however, showcased a conceptual spacecraft called the Luan Niao, an orbital mothership designed to launch uncrewed fighter drones and “hyper-ballistic missiles” from the edge of space.

According to the Telegraph, the Luan Niao design specs point to a behemoth spaceship that would measure nearly 800 feet nose-to-tail and span some 2,244 feet in width. With that size, designers say it could weigh as much as 120,000 tons, with a payload of 88 “Xuan Nu” autonomous fighter drones that operate in the upper limits of the stratosphere.

Xuan Nu fighters are also a conceptual spacecraft, a hypothetical 6th generation jet showcased at tech exhibitions to get students and the public hyped for careers in engineering and science.

The Xuan Nu fighter concept has been circling around aerospace trade shows since at least 2019, while the idea for the Luan Niao dates back a full decade. However, both craft have been newly revived as audacious 3D renders for the “South Heaven Gate Project,” a coordinated push to align China’s aerospace and defense sectors around a common — if far fetched — goal.

The South Heaven Gate announcement by state media sparked a number of excited posts from Chinese netizens, including fictional stories set in a near future where the People’s Republic has a fleet of Luan Niao carriers circling the globe.

If the massive spacecraft ever makes it to reality, it would “outclass pretty much everyone,” Peter Layton, defense expert and fellow at Australia’s Griffith Asia Institute told the Telegraph.

Layton noted that the Luan Niao would allow China’s military to deploy military assets pretty much anywhere it wants without in the world: “You’re also out of range of the weather, generally speaking — and you’re out of range of most defensive systems.”

The tremendous energy required to launch a 120,000 ton craft makes the Laun Niao and its drone fleet a distant fantasy. But given China’s rapid pace of technological development in recent years, what seems impossible today may not stay that way for long.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Veteran NASA astronaut Don Pettit returned from his 220-day mission on board the International Space Station in April 2025, the day of his 70th birthday, making him the oldest active astronaut on the space agency’s roster.

During his seven-month stint on board the aging orbital outpost, his fourth trip to space, Pettit took the time to photograph some dazzling views of the Earth below.

On October 20, 2024, he took a stunning picture of an airplane that was passing by at cruising altitude hundreds of miles below him, a perspective only a handful of people get to enjoy. The plane was likely at around 7.5 miles in altitude, while the ISS orbits the Earth at around 250 miles.

But a moderator at the r/aviation subreddit didn’t look too kindly on the shot after Pettit posted it to the forum over the weekend, deeming it too “blurry” and taking it down as a result. According to a circulating screenshot posted by a user who first brought attention to the takedown, the mod team pointed to the subreddit’s rules to justify its decision, which state that “all blurry or low quality pictures are removed.”

The controversial decision kicked off a heated discussion — and prompted an interjection by a different moderator.

“We brought some new people onto the mod team and unfortunately there are some Learning curves,” the moderator wrote, apologizing for the takedown. “I caught the issue and fixed it. Thanks to everyone who let me know that this happened.”

“I’d say the quality of the picture is pretty dang good considering that it’s from about 250 miles away,” the mod added in a separate apology addressed to Pettit directly.

In a meta twist, after this story was first published, it ended up getting posted to r/aviation. To their credit, not only did the mods not delete it, but they took the opportunity to once again take responsibility and pledge to do better.

“We completely acknowledge that the post was removed in error and that this removal should not have occurred in the first place,” they wrote. “We have talked with all the moderators on the team to ensure that this does not happen again. We are committed to fixing our mistakes, and we reapproved the post as soon as we were made aware of the issue.”

A quick perusal of Pettit’s submissions to Reddit shows several other fascinating vantage points from the ISS, from atmospheric distortion of the Moon that makes it appear squashed to the Milky Way glinting behind the Earth at night. Another long exposure shows the trails left behind by SpaceX’s Sun-reflecting Starlink satellites.

Other Reddit users were far more impressed than the mod who pulled the post down.

“Can’t believe I got flexed by someone on ISS,” one user wrote.

“Tower, can we get a speed check?” another user joked. (The ISS orbits the Earth at a ground speed of 17,100 mph, while an average passenger jet travels at around 500 to 700 mph, depending on conditions.)

Nonetheless, many users on the subreddit were left with a bad taste in their mouths, with one user describing the unfortunate takedown as “Reddit in a nutshell, baby!” — in an apparent reference to the often-pedantic nature of the people who moderate niche interest subreddits.

“Dear mods, please show NASA how to take better pictures from space so you don’t have to delete them,” the user, who initially raised the issue, wrote.

“What a joke,” another user mocked. One of the most epic pics of aviation from the coolest possible place from an actual astronaut.”

“‘This post breaks our rules,&#39;” they added. “Give me a break, man.”

            <div id="article-text">For decades, the United States stock market has been a juggernaut on the international stage. The US dollar has been — and still is — the de facto currency globally.

But for how much longer that will be the case is now looking uncertain. As the New York Times reports, investors are starting to look elsewhere as the Trump administration continues to threaten the independence of its central bank, start a trade war with Europe, and implement self-conflicting monetary policies. As a result of it all, the US dollar continues to weaken, making foreign investments in Europe and Asia far more lucrative.

Meanwhile, Wall Street continues to make enormous bets on artificial intelligence, a highly risky gambit, as tech companies still have plenty to prove and a return still appears to be many years out. The AI boom has sent tech company valuations soaring: the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla) now account for just over a third of the entire S&P 500, with experts warning that the industry could be propping up a rough-looking US economy.

The International Monetary Fund warned that the weakening hype surrounding AI could be among the biggest risks to global economic growth, noting that if expectations about AI turn out to be too optimistic, a market correction could send shockwaves across global markets.

President Donald Trump’s nomination for the next chair of the central banking system, Kevin Warsh, appeared to do little to stop the continued weakening of the US dollar, which hit a four-year low last week. The Euro and British pound saw their values soar when measured against the US dollar this year.

Trump —also a huge AI booster, underlining the circular nature of the whole situation — celebrated the weakening dollar, arguing it would make products more affordable, in comments that alarmed investors. Officials had to step in to smooth things over, the NYT reported, arguing that despite Trump’s comments, the US government still supports a strong dollar.

Whether Wall Street’s enormous appetite for AI continues to be a weakening economy’s saving grace, for how long remains to be seen. Investors are sending a clear signal: riskier bets are no longer a hot commodity, as demonstrated by the recent plummet in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Instead, historically safer bets like gold are proving far more lucrative, reaching record highs of $5,500 an ounce in January. Despite a massive drop last week, gold is trading 70 percent higher year over year, indicating investors are seriously on edge.

            <div id="article-text">Like a hurricane that tears down even the sturdiest storm shelters, the Epstein files have cut a path through a vast swath of America’s intellectual, political, and financial elite.

The latest tranche of emails related to the notorious sex predator have been particularly devastating. Fans of the left-libertarian academic Noam Chomsky are in shambles after learning the two were in close contact until around 2017, while tech luminaries from Bill Gates to the Google cofounders were similarly caught schmoozing with the disgraced financier.

Cypto bros are no exception. After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years.

One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT’s Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. As the email exchange makes clear, Epstein’s backing was a key pillar in establishing the DGI.

“FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.”

“At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin’s code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. “Today there are 47,583 commits to Bitcoin’s code. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.”

That news didn’t go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly.

“75 percent of bitcoins code comes directly from [Epstein’s] investments,” a crypto account called Crypto Bitlord agonized in response. “We’ve basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. I feel sick.”

Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.”

The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin’s mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein.

One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto’s” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency.

“I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads.

As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James.

“Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein.

“great. ,” the financier replied in typo-filled prose, “you will need to fly to st thomas. just let me know times. looking foward to it.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was only yesterday that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had acquired his AI company xAI, a merger that catapulted the rocket maker into being the most valuable private company in the world, but raised significant questions about bringing two firms with vastly different missions under the same wing.

Now, the freshly-joined entity is facing one of its first major tests. On Tuesday, French authorities raided the offices of X, Elon Musk’s social media site owned by xAI, as part of its ongoing criminal investigation into the sexual deepfakes generated by its AI chatbot Grok. Following the acquisition, of course, those X offices are now SpaceX offices.

The raid was carried out by the Paris Public Prosecutor Office’s cybercrime unit, in collaboration with French police and Europol. And it’s perhaps an early warning sign of how all the baggage that SpaceX is inheriting by bringing Musk’s controversial AI efforts into the fold may haunt the company going forward.

In an announcement, the Paris prosecutors said it was investigating criminal offenses related to the distribution of “child pornography images,” the infringement of personal rights through the generation of “sexual deepfakes,” and the denial of “crimes against humanity,” per NBC News.

In addition to searching X’s offices, Musk and X’s former CEO Linda Yaccarino were issued a voluntary summons to appear and answer questions the week of April 20.

SpaceX is not without controversy: its Starship rocket has generated plenty of scrutiny and public backlash from its frequent explosions, which critics argue threaten public safety and flout environmental laws. But by and large, it’s the most beloved Musk venture, as space exploration is something that earns a lot of public goodwill, serving some greater mission for all of humankind. Now, its image is undoubtedly being tainted by its association with xAI and Grok.

Grok in particular is no stranger to making the wrong kinds of headlines. Last month, French prosecutors opened an investigation into Musk’s platform after the AI chatbot was used to generate nonconsensual sexualized images of real people, many of them appearing to be minors, in a weeks-long spree that started at the end of December and stretched into January.

The digital “undressing” trend was so out of control that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute. In all, the Center for Countering Digital Hate estimated that as many as 3,000,000 of these sexualized images were produced, including more than 23,000 images of children.

The prosecutor office also said it was investigating the distribution of Holocaust denial content on the platform. Far-right accounts have flourished under Musk’s ownership of X, formerly Twitter, with Musk often resharing racist conspiracy theories and antisemitic rhetoric — a habit mirrored by Grok, which gained notoriety for calling itself “MechaHitler” during a particularly racist posting spree last summer.

Governments abroad have seemed to take Grok’s AI nudes of women and children more seriously. Indonesia and Malaysia banned access to Grok, though the former has just lifted its ban “conditionally.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer vowed to crackdown on the chatbot and showed support for the nation’s communications regulator Ofcom, after it announced its own investigation into Grok.

Mirroring developments across the channel, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced its own probe into Grok on Tuesday, over its “potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content,” per the BBC. “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” William Malcolm, the ICO’s executive director for regulatory risk and innovation, said in a statement.

The renewed regulatory pressure abroad comes after fresh reporting from the Washington Post detailed how some xAI employees were appalled by the startup’s abrupt pivot into embracing heavily sexualized content, as Musk pushed to make Grok as engaging as possible. Employees said that the company rolled back guardrails on sexual material and ignored repeated warnings that Grok could allow users to churn out sexualized images of children and celebrities that could be illegal. xAI’s safety team reportedly consisted of just two or three people for most of 2025.

Though Starship and a revenge-porn generating Grok would seemingly have little in common, Musk explained in an announcement about the acquisition that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested and all the untapped real-estate that putting data centers in orbit opens up. He also stated that he wants to populate the Earth’s orbit with AI satellites to build what he likened to a “sentient sun.” These are ambitions that will be years in the making — but in the meantime, SpaceX will have to survive its now close association with CSAM-generating AI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Adobe is putting on hold its plan to discontinue Adobe Animate following intense backlash from its customers after it announced plans to shut down the 2D animation software amid an increased focus on its investments in AI.

“We are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content,” the company wrote in a post on Wednesday.

Adobe’s Monday announcement about discontinuing Animate was met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger, and users aired concerns about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.

The company changed its tune on Wednesday, saying there would no longer be a “deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.”

“Adobe Animate is in maintenance mode for all customers. This applies to individual, small business, and enterprise customers.  Maintenance mode means we will continue to support the application and provide ongoing security and bug fixes, but we are no longer adding new features. Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users - we will not be discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate,” it said.

One customer, posting on X, had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like, “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” and, “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.”

On Monday, the company updated its support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing that Adobe Animate would be discontinued on March 1, 2026. Enterprise customers would continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition, the company said at the time. Other customers would have support through March of next year.

Adobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an FAQ, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”

Hey @Adobe open source this instead of ending it pic.twitter.com/ZZNn5cZYS4

we literally had a whole semester of adobe animate class and now they&#39;re discontinuing it 😭 https://t.co/Xsn9t05qpV

Reading between the lines, it seemed as if Adobe was saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.

What’s surprising is that Adobe couldn’t even recommend software that would fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it said customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”

For instance, it suggested that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes and other design elements.

There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction when no mention was made of Animate at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.

Before switching to “maintenance mode,” Abode had intended for the software to continue to work for those who have it downloaded. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.

Some users have been recommending other animation programs to use as a replacement, including Moho Animation and Toon Boom Harmony.

Updated, Feb. 4, 2026, to note that Adobe reversed its decision and announced the software would be placed in maintenance mode instead of discontinued.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uber is promoting Balaji Krishnamurthy, its VP of strategic finance and investor relations, to be its CFO, replacing its current finance chief Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.

Krishnamurthy has been at Uber for over six years, spending most of his tenure in the company in its investor relations division. He often posts about the company’s autonomous ride-hailing efforts, and has a board seat at AV company Waabi — so the appointment may be a signal of the company’s plans to expand its driverless investments and operations.

Indeed, on the company’s Q4 earnings call on Wednesday, Krishnamurthy said the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”

“With large and growing free cash flows, over the coming years we will invest with discipline across a multitude of opportunities, including positioning Uber to win in an AV future,” Krishnamurthy wrote in a statement detailing the company’s Q4 results.

Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on the call that he was convinced autonomous vehicles would “unlock a multi-trillion dollar opportunity,” for the company, adding that autonomy “fundamentally amplifies” the strengths of the company’s platform.

“By the end of 2026, we expect to be facilitating AV trips in as many as 15 cities globally, with a roughly even split of U.S. and international cities. And by 2029, we intend to be the largest facilitator of AV trips in the world,” Khosrowshahi said.

Uber said revenue rose to $14.37 billion in the fourth quarter, up 20% from a year earlier, driven by strong demand for its food delivery services.

Mahendra-Rajah is leaving Uber after three years at the company.

            <h2>SNAK Venture Partners raises $50M fund to back vertical marketplaces</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/snak-venture-partners-raises-50m-fund-to-back-digitizing-marketplaces/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SNAK Venture Partners announced Wednesday the close of its oversubsubscribed $50 million debut fund, anchored by the investment firm Pritzker Group (founded by Illinois governor JB Pritzker and his brother, Tony).

SNAK founders Sonia Nagar and Adam Koopersmith worked at the firm and helped lead investments in companies like the auto marketplace Backlot Cars and TicketsNow (exited to Ticketmaster). The duo decided to break out on their own and, earlier this year, launched their firm to back digital marketplaces.

“It felt like the timing was right and there was support within the firm to go do this,” Nagar said.

The vision is that there is still so much to digitize, like in supply chain and construction, and this is the moment to strike because even holdout industries are more comfortable adopting new technology as fintech architecture advances.

“If you look at the biggest venture wins over the last decade,” she said, pointing to the likes of Uber, Instacart, and Airbnb, “those are five of the top 10 outcomes in venture.” As in those companies that raised billions from investors, went on to IPO, and returned millions to them.

“Most of those wins were in consumer, which tends to be faster-moving than large enterprises,” Nagar continued. “We think there’s a ton of white space to double down and focus on B2B marketplaces.” Looking specifically for the categories that haven’t yet digitized.

The firm has already invested in six companies, including BigRentals and Repackify, focused on equipment rental and packaging logistics, respectively. Nagar said the firm hopes to overall write seed checks into at least 20 companies, at $1 million to $2 million a pop. She said they hope to deploy the entire fund within the next 3 to 4 years.

Though many new funds are struggling to raise capital (and capital remains concentrated at the top), Nagar said she and Koopersmith were able to lean on their backgrounds when wooing LPs.

Nagar previously helped launch Amazon apparel back in 2009 and was head of mobile at RetailMeNot. Koopersmith, meanwhile, spent 20 years at Pritzker Group and serves on the board of various marketplace companies. At the same time, Nagar said that without Pritzker’s support, it would have been quite hard to raise this fund, especially in last year’s environment.

Other LPs in their fund include the State of Illinois Growth and Innovation Fund and executives from other marketplace companies, like Favor Delivery and RetailMeNot.

Nagar said the firm is also location-agnostic, recognizing that the still-hidden marketplaces may not be found only in Silicon Valley and New York City. “We’re finding these overlooked founders in places where maybe other funds aren’t looking,” she said.

SNAK is itself based in Chicago, which she said some LPs have questioned. “People perceive that as a disadvantage; we view it as an advantage,” she continued. “We can get to everybody very fast.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/alexa-amazons-ai-assistant-is-now-available-to-everyone-in-the-u-s/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alexa+, Amazon’s upgraded, generative AI-powered version of its Alexa assistant, is available to all U.S. customers as of Wednesday. The company said that the AI feature will be free to Prime members across devices. Meanwhile, anyone can use Alexa+ for free via the Alexa website or mobile app, with some limitations.

“We have tens of millions of customers using Alexa+ now, and now we’re going to make it available to all Prime members…Prime members enjoy unlimited access — it’s basically a paid tier level of access that we’re including in Prime now,” notes Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch.

Announced last year, Alexa+ is model agnostic — meaning it runs on a combination of Amazon’s own foundation models and those from other companies, allowing the assistant to do more than the basic tasks of its predecessor using whatever AI technology is best for the job.

As an AI assistant, Alexa+ can carry on natural language conversations that include follow-up questions and back-and-forth chat.

In addition to performing smart home tasks, scheduling timers, or offering news and weather, as before, the new assistant can do most things that other AI chatbots can do — like planning an itinerary for a trip, updating a shared calendar, finding and saving recipes to a library, making movie recommendations, helping with homework, exploring a topic, and more.

Plus, integrations with services like Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, Uber, Angi, Expedia, Square, Yelp, Fodor’s, OpenTable, and Suno will allow Alexa to perform more complex tasks, like scheduling a dinner reservation or requesting an Uber ride. Amazon has not yet shared user adoption numbers on this more “agentic” use case (where the AI acts autonomously to complete tasks) for the AI helper.

During its year-long beta testing period, Alexa customers had the option to try the AI feature or roll back to the prior version. The company tells TechCrunch the option to revert to the old Alexa will continue to be available, but couldn’t say for how long. Likely, Amazon wants a bit more time to improve the AI experience before making it a requirement for users. The percentage of those opting out is also a key metric to track, but Rausch notes that the figure is in the low single digits, suggesting that most customers are not so unhappy with Alexa+ that they’re giving up.

Still, Amazon has had to work to resolve bugs and address user feedback ahead of this launch. Some beta testers complained that Alexa+ was too chatty, or interrupted at the wrong times, for instance. Others complained about Alexa’s new voice.

Amazon has taken in this feedback and made changes over time. For instance, the company revised the onboarding experience to have Alexa explain how to change her voice, as some preferred Alexa’s “OG” voice. (That voice is still available as Alexa+ voice No. 2, but it now uses AI to add more inflection.)

“Eventually, we had her use her new version of her old voice, and then switch back again, just to show customers,” says Rausch, describing the changes the team made to onboarding.

In another example, Amazon tried to make Alexa less prone to unwanted interruptions. Now, Alexa will ask, “Is that for me?” when the AI is unsure who is being addressed.

Rausch points out that the overall experience is configurable, too. If customers don’t want the follow-on mode, for instance — which allows Alexa to continue listening after responding — they can turn it off.

Asked if users will be able to change the AI assistant’s personality, as in other AI chatbots, where the AI can be set to be personal, professional, quirky, nerdy, and more,  Rausch says simply, “Stay tuned.”

During the beta, Amazon reported positive adoption trends in terms of both usage and engagement, with few customers opting for rollbacks. Music streams increased by 25% after customers upgraded to Alexa+, and more customers are engaging deeply with recipes, a feature that has seen 5x growth.

Overall, customers are having 2 to 3 times more conversations with Alexa+, compared with the original Alexa.

While Alexa+ will be free to U.S. Prime members, non-Prime customers could opt to pay $19.99/month for standalone access — a price that’s comparable to something like ChatGPT Plus.

Amazon notes the free experience on web and mobile will have some limits, but these are mainly in place to protect against abuse.

“I think we’ve got some great, generous limits. We’re not talking about exactly what they are today, but…there are some [limits],” Rausch says.

The Alexa+ experience in the U.S. will be available across Alexa devices, including Echo products, Fire TV, Alexa.com, the Alexa mobile app, and Alexa-enabled devices from partners including Samsung, Bose, and others, with more to come.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/apeiron-labs-gets-95m-to-flood-the-oceans-with-autonomous-underwater-robots/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of what we know about the ocean just skims the surface, literally. We’ve gathered a large quantity of data on the oceans from satellites, but most of that is based on the top layer of water. Below that, the picture gets murkier.

Buoys, ships, and some autonomous rovers have recently added some detail, but it’s nothing like what we get from satellites today. It’s frustrating to everyone from fishermen to the Coast Guard, meteorologists to offshore wind developers.

“Getting data from the subsurface ocean has always been really hard,” Ravi Pappu, founder and CEO of Apeiron Labs, told TechCrunch. “It’s really slow. You need a ship that costs $100,000 a day, [and] steams out slowly. Everything’s an expedition.”

Pappu hopes that his bobbing, autonomous underwater vehicle can change that. He founded Apeiron Labs in 2022 after a stint as CTO of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. There, the lack of data on the ocean was “a persistent problem” that kept coming up.

To fill the gaps, Apeiron Labs is building low-cost vehicles that travel 400 meters up and down the water column (the vertical section of ocean from surface to seafloor), sampling temperature, salinity, and acoustics once or twice per day. Apeiron currently sells to both civilian and defense customers, Pappu said.

To build and sell more of its autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), Apeiron Labs recently closed a $9.5 million Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health and S2G Investments, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Assembly Ventures, Bay Bridge Ventures, and TFX Capital participated.

At three feet long, five inches in diameter, and just over 20 pounds, the startup’s AUVs can be deployed from boats or airplanes. Not coincidentally, they also fit into the U.S. Navy’s existing launch equipment. Once the AUV hits the water, it gets its bearings and connects to a cloud-based operating system, where it logs its data.

While it dives, the operating system uses models of the ocean to predict where it will surface. When the AUV finally breaches and reconnects with the operating system, the cloud-based software incorporates the new data to refine its models. The AUVs are spaced about 10 km to 20 km apart (6.2 miles to 12.4 miles), forming a line or array that captures data in greater resolution than ship-based efforts.

Apeiron envisions deploying dozens or hundreds of its AUVs for a range of customers. The Pentagon might use them to listen for submarines off the coast of the U.S., while fisheries might want to receive more detailed temperature and salinity data about prime fishing waters. The goal is persistent monitoring in key parts of the ocean.

Pappu said that at Apeiron’s current scale, it has brought the cost of ocean data down by 100-fold. He wants to get it down by a factor of 1,000, and he thinks Apeiron can hit that target next year. Referencing a type of small, low-cost satellite, Pappu adds: “We think of ourselves as the CubeSat for the ocean.”

Update 10 am ET: The headline has been updated to reflect that Apeiron raised $9.5 million, not $29 million.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/accel-doubles-down-on-fibr-ai-as-agents-turn-static-websites-into-one-to-one-experiences/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While advertising and targeting have become increasingly personalized, the website — the final destination for that traffic — has remained largely static. Fibr AI aims to bridge that gap by using AI agents to turn generic webpages into one-to-one experiences tailored to each visitor, a thesis that has prompted Accel to double down on the company.

Accel has led Fibr AI’s $5.7 million seed round following an earlier $1.8 million pre-seed investment in 2024. The fresh funding also included participation from WillowTree Ventures and MVP Ventures, alongside Fortune 100 operators joining as angel investors and advisors, bringing the startup’s total funding to $7.5 million.

For large companies, the gap between increasingly personalized ads and largely generic website experiences has traditionally been filled by a mix of personalization software, engineering teams, and marketing agencies — a model that is slow, expensive, and difficult to scale. While ads can be tailored instantly for different audiences, changing what happens once a visitor lands on a site often requires weeks of coordination and limits teams to running only a handful of experiments each year. Fibr AI argues that this human-heavy operating model no longer works. Instead, the startup uses autonomous AI agents to infer intent, generate variations, and continuously optimize pages in real time.

Fibr AI replaces the agency- and engineering-heavy model with autonomous systems that operate continuously, Ankur Goyal (pictured above, right), the co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview.

“We are [the] software, and the agency is the workforce of agents we are deploying,” Goyal told TechCrunch, adding that this allows Fibr AI to run thousands of experiments in parallel rather than a few dozen each year.

Adoption was initially slow. Founded in early 2023 by Goyal and Pritam Roy (pictured above, left), Fibr AI had just one or two customers for much of its first two years as enterprises took time to evaluate the approach. That began to change last year, Goyal said, with adoption picking up among large U.S. companies, including banks and healthcare providers, bringing the total number of customers to 12.

“We are an infra afterthought layer,” Goyal told TechCrunch. “Once it’s set up, nobody wants to think about it again.” That dynamic, he added, has led Fibr AI to sign three- to five-year contracts with large enterprises, which tend to treat website infrastructure as something to standardize rather than continuously revisit.

At a technical level, Fibr AI operates as a layer on top of an existing website, connecting to a company’s advertising, analytics, and customer data systems to understand how visitors arrive and what they are likely looking for. Its AI agents then assemble and adjust page content, such as copy, imagery, and layout, treating each URL as a system that learns and optimizes continuously rather than a fixed page. Instead of relying on manually configured rules or sequential A/B tests, the platform runs large numbers of micro-experiments in parallel and updates experiences systematically as traffic flows in from different channels.

That shift has direct cost implications for large enterprises. Traditional website personalization typically combines software licenses with agency retainers and engineering time, tying costs to people rather than outcomes. Goyal said enterprises are increasingly evaluating Fibr AI’s platform based on cost per experiment and conversion impact, rather than the number of tools or people involved.

For Accel, that operating model — rather than the AI buzz — was central to the decision to invest again. “Advertising today is one-to-one, but when users land on a website it becomes one-to-many,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel. “You can create hundreds of ads for different audiences, but they all still land on the same page.” Fibr’s ability to turn that dynamic into one-to-one personalization, he said, stood out because it removed the agency and engineering bottlenecks that typically limit how far enterprises can push experimentation.

Swaroop added that early enterprise adoption, particularly among banks and healthcare companies, helped validate the thesis. “These are regulated, conservative industries,” he said. “When they start saying, ‘We need this, and we’re willing to pay for it,’ that’s when we feel confident doubling down.”

While most of Fibr AI’s business today is driven by personalizing experiences for human visitors, Accel and Fibr AI also see potential in how AI agents are beginning to mediate online discovery. As users increasingly research, compare, and shortlist products using large language models and AI chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, before visiting a website, Swaroop said, the ability for sites to adapt based on what a visitor — or an AI system acting on their behalf — already knows could become more important over time.

“That part is still early,” Swaroop said, “but the companies building for today’s needs while being ready for that shift tomorrow are the ones we want to back.”

With the new funding, Fibr AI plans to focus on expanding its sales and customer-facing teams in the U.S., while continuing to build out its technical base in India. The San Francisco-headquartered startup maintains an office in Bengaluru, with 17 of its roughly 23 employees based in India and the remaining six in the U.S.

Goyal said the startup targets about $5 million in annual recurring revenue by the end of this year and around 50 enterprise customers.

Fibr AI is entering a space long dominated by incumbents such as Adobe and Optimizely, which offer experimentation and personalization tools to large enterprises. But both Goyal and Swaroop argued that those platforms are constrained by how they are built and sold, typically relying on marketing agencies and engineering teams to configure and operate them. That model, they said, makes it difficult to move quickly or scale experimentation, even as customer acquisition and messaging have become increasingly dynamic.

“Incumbents have been slow in bringing out products,” Swaroop said, adding that even when new features arrive, they often come years after demand has shifted.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, and Will Lewis, the publisher he appointed at the end of 2023, are embarking on the latest step of their plan to kill everything that makes the paper special. The Post has survived for nearly 150 years, evolving from a hometown family newspaper into an indispensable national institution, and a pillar of the democratic system. But if Bezos and Lewis continue down their present path, it may not survive much longer.

Over recent years, they’ve repeatedly cut the newsroom—killing its Sunday magazine, reducing the staff by several hundred, nearly halving the Metro desk—without acknowledging the poor business decisions that led to this moment or providing a clear vision for the future. This morning, executive editor Matt Murray and HR chief Wayne Connell told the newsroom staff in an early-morning virtual meeting that it was closing the Sports department and Books section, ending its signature podcast, and dramatically gutting the International and Metro departments, in addition to staggering cuts across all teams. Post leadership—which did not even have the courage to address their staff in person—then left everyone to wait for an email letting them know whether or not they had a job. (Lewis, who has already earned a reputation for showing up late to work when he showed up at all, did not join the Zoom.)

The Post may yet rise, but this will be their enduring legacy.

What’s happening to the Post is a public tragedy, but for me, it is also very personal. When my parents’ basement recently flooded, amid the waterlogged boxes of old photos and vinyl records, we found my younger sister’s baby book. There, on a page reserved for memories from the month she was born—news about visits from doting grandparents, perhaps, or descriptions of her mewling gurgles—my dad had filled the lines with news from our hometown paper, The Washington Post.

“Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).” “Irangate.” “The Bork nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.” “The NFL went on strike.” “Wall Street had the worst day since 1929!!!” “The U.S. was having a garbage crisis, i.e.; running out of disposal sites, esp. in the northeast.” (To be fair, he worked in waste management. But also … welcome to the world, Baby Girl!)

Which is to say: The Washington Post feels like a part of my family’s DNA, imprinted on our earliest memories, memorialized among clippings of our hair and other, more traditional, recollections (first diaper blowout, first word).

As a kid growing up in Bethesda, Maryland, I can’t remember a time when the Post was not, somehow, woven through the fabric of my life. I cut out Sports-section photos of the Redskins coach Joe Gibbs and the quarterback Mark Rypien to plaster on the walls of my childhood bedroom the year my dad taught me how to watch football.

Just before I turned 12, a junior at Walt Whitman High School—where I was soon to start—slammed her white BMW into a tree after a night of drinking with three friends, splitting the car in half and instantly killing herself and a friend, and gravely injuring the other two girls. The Post was where I looked to understand what had happened, to grapple with the potent mix of youth and privilege and tragedy. Later, I picked up the Post to comb for box scores and recaps of my varsity basketball games; to admire the far more gifted athletes from across the region who had made their various All-Met teams; and to follow each new development of the Washington, D.C., snipers, who terrorized the area and transfixed the country.

The Post was also how I fell in love with journalism. Every newspaper lover has the section they read first—Sports, Comics, Metro—and mine was Style. The section, which debuted in 1969, was like nothing that had come before it, or what has come since: a newspaper that gave its writers the time and space and freedom and voice to produce narrative long-form journalism that was must-read, holding its own against the New Journalism magazine greats of the era. And for me, it was a chance to commune with giants—to read people such as Libby Copeland, Robin Givhan, Paul Hendrickson, Sally Quinn, David Von Drehle, Gene Weingarten, Marjorie Williams—and puzzle over how they’d done it.

Then, in 2017, I arrived at the Post as a reporter to cover the Trump White House, and I stayed for eight magical years. I had planned to stay forever. So what is happening at the Post right now—what has been happening there for a while—is personal. But it is also so much larger than me or any single person.

The least cynical explanation is that Bezos simply isn’t paying attention. Maybe—like so many of us initially—he was charmed by Lewis’s British accent and studied loucheness that mask an emperor whose bespoke threads are no clothes at all. Or maybe, as many of us who deeply love the Post fear, the decimation is the plan.

The Post journalists I know have shown a genuine willingness—even an eagerness—to evolve, a spirit of creativity and innovation at a time of transformation in the media. But its executives seem not to know where to lead it. Among the many failures here—of leadership, management, business, imagination, courage—the actual journalism stands strong.

Journalism is—has always been—a tough industry. But I watched firsthand as Bezos, Lewis, and company spoke in turgid corporate-ese (“Fix it, build it, scale it”) and failed to launch—or even attempt to launch—initiatives that might achieve their grandiose visions. They began 2025 by unveiling the “Big Hairy Audacious Goal” of jumping from about 2.5 million subscribers to 200 million paying users, despite having ended the previous year hemorrhaging tens of thousands of their existing subscribers, all while blaming the journalists for the paper’s travails.

I don’t pretend to have the answers to the Post’s financial woes, or a successful business model for a local paper that is also the nation’s hometown paper. But I can tell you what will be lost if these two men—who don’t seem to understand what the Post was, what it still is, and what it could be—continue to treat it like a distressed asset or a bargaining chip with a president who, ultimately, does not respect bargaining supplicants.

Marty Weil—who is now in his 61st year at the Post—was subbing as a night editor on the Metro desk when he heard five words crackle across the police scanner: “Doors open at the Watergate.” Al Lewis, the dayside police-beat reporter, wrote the first story that appeared on the June 18, 1972, front page—“5 Held in Plot to Bug Democrats’ Office Here.” And then Gene Bachinski, who handled the beat at night, got a key tip: An arresting officer allowed him to glimpse the address book of one of the Watergate burglars, containing a scribbled entry, “H Hunt. WH,” and a number that went straight to the White House.

Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported for duty that Sunday, and they soon took over. The story went national, toppling a presidency and inspiring generations of journalists. But it was also quintessential Post reporting—relentlessly and fearlessly pursuing the truth and holding power to account in a collaborative effort across the newsroom. (That initial story lists eight—eight!—Post journalists who contributed reporting, an early preview of the triple- and even quadruple-bylined stories that have come to mark the paper’s most ambitious efforts.)

Watergate was hardly the last time that the paper turned coverage of local events into national news. The Post also reported on the September 11 attacks—which killed 125 people at the Pentagon and all 64 people aboard American Airlines Flight 77 when it crashed; the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, which left 32 professors and students dead and dozens more injured; and the January 6 riot at the Capitol and its aftermath. This past year, the Post, with expert reporters at nearly every major federal agency, delivered unsurpassed accounts of the DOGE-ing of the federal government. (Amid the paper’s steady stream of scoops, last month federal agents raided the Virginia home of Hannah Natanson, the Post’s “federal government whisper.”) Whatever bar you set for success—exposing corruption, changing lives, moving readers to tears and to action, bringing joy and understanding to the community it serves, winning prizes—the Post has always cleared it.

Today’s’s layoffs provide a whiff of the latest alleged strategy: an almost-exclusive focus on politics and national-security coverage, though even that explanation defies credulity, as the growing list of those laid off includes some of the nation’s finest political and international reporters and editors. As one longtime Post reporter observed to me, “We’re changing and trimming and cutting our way toward a much more mundane product, and one that doesn’t seem to attract more readers.” To the extent that a plan exists, it seems to be to transform the Post into a facsimile of Politico. (In another cruel irony, Politico was born out of the Post nearly two decades ago, when two reporters decamped to launch their own fast-paced, scoop-driven, win-the-morning publication.)

But general-interest publications can be profitable. The New York Times has shown there is money to be made by diversifying, expanding, experimenting, offering something for everyone. (News! Audio! Games! Cooking! Video! Long-form!) The publication you’re reading now is profitable, and has nearly 1.5 million subscribers. Other specialty publications, such as Axios and Punchbowl News, have succeeded by tripling down on the needs and interests of their core audience. The Post, instead, is abandoning its current audience in search of one that may not exist.

What Bezos, Lewis, and their jargon-loving underlings also fail to understand is that the paper’s coverage of Washington will be neither as vivid nor as authoritative without the contributions of journalists in bureaus around the world. Those correspondents risk their life to help readers understand how, say, the United States deposing a leader in Venezuela may have consequences for citizens living in Ohio. Coverage of the White House and Congress is enhanced by a well-sourced Metro team and gimlet-eyed narrators in Style. And you can’t be this capital city’s definitive chronicler if you don’t cover our beloved Nats and Caps and Commanders, what’s going on in our kids’ schools, or what restaurant has the best pupusas.

George Packer: The Washington Post is dying a death of despair

Nearly all media outlets are struggling to reinvent themselves. But the Post should have been better equipped than most to meet the moment. It has a great reputation, great talent, and great positioning to cover local stories for a large and highly educated audience willing to pay for news, and to serve a broader national audience eager for deep political and accountability reporting.

“This is the nation’s capital, and the people who live here are diplomats and federal-government employees and public servants and national security advisers and people who work in the White House who also send their kids to school here,” a local Post reporter told me. “And you can live in Northwest or you can live in Southeast, and everyone is pissed that the snow isn’t plowed.”

Last week, the paper’s foreign correspondents released a video aimed at Bezos, explaining how, as the Ukraine bureau chief, Siobhán O&#39;Grady, puts it, they have been risking their life to cover wars, pandemics, civil uprisings, and so much more. In the two-minute video, often against the backdrop of explosions and other dangers, the journalists offer vignettes of their daily life: “I was there when a Russian missile hit a Ukrainian playground and killed nine kids.” “I was there when the Taliban tightened their grip on Afghanistan.” “I was there in January 2020, outside of Wuhan, when China shut it down to contain a mysterious virus.”

The power of the Post has always been its pulsing humanity, the zippy teamwork that has allowed each individual to produce something so much greater than they could have achieved on their own.

I was there. I was there. I was there. We were there.

Not being The New York Times, being forced to do more with less, was freeing. It created—required—a culture of collegiality and collaboration, a willingness to experiment and take risks, a certain puckishness. “There’s sort of an Avis mentality at the Post: ‘We try harder,’” Mike Semel, a longtime Post editor who now works at The Athletic, told me. He was referring to the rent-a-car company’s now-famous 1962 ad campaign, which embraced its No. 2 status to Hertz, promising better customer service and, in the process, juicing its revenue. As Avis understood, being the underdog is liberating.

During President Trump’s first term, the then–executive editor, Marty Baron, green-lit a graphic-nonfiction version of the Mueller Report and later turned it into a book. And when Congress declined to create a September 11–style commission to investigate the January 6 attacks, the Post decided that it would do what Congress would not: Without subpoena power, more than 100 journalists from across the newsroom produced a 38,000-word investigative series, “The Attack,” offering the definitive story of the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. (It was part of the package that won the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.)

The Post has always been a writers’ paper, a newsroom so thoroughly scrappy that simultaneously anything seems possible—big ideas, big ambition—and it still feels like a small miracle each day when such consistently good journalism emerges from such glorious mayhem. (For my entire time there, I tracked my vacation days and comp time on yellow Post-it notes, which my editors unfailingly honored.)

There was a sense that great journalism could come from anyone, in any corner of the K Street newsroom. Exciting projects and challenging investigations were not walled off for certain elite teams. The Post was a place where everyone could be, and was, part of the same shared mission; we wore Democracy Dies in Darkness hoodies to work, blue-and-white WP beanies in the winter.

It helped that even the paper’s biggest stars learned how to be reporters on the same unglamorous beats—Southern Maryland; Virginia’s Loudoun County; the loud, sweaty gyms of high-school sports; night cops. “It’s hard to explain to somebody from the outside,” Semel said. While everyone else got to celebrate Independence Day, generations of Post reporters had to spend their holiday afternoon on the sunbaked grass by the Lincoln Memorial, putting together stories for the next day’s paper. “David Fahrenthold stood on the Mall on the 4th of July, before he won his Pulitzer.”

At its core, compelling narrative writing is an exercise in building empathy and helping Americans in a fractured country understand one another. But that empathy and compassion and teamwork extended within the newsroom, as well.

We shared phone numbers and scenes from our notebooks, invited our colleagues to join us at source lunches and drinks, and spent time on Slack trying to make one another laugh. Often, one of my cubicle-mates would overhear me on the phone and, before I’d even hung up, had emailed a suggestion for my story or sent me the contact info of a person I should call.

Others simply texted “wellness check,” again and again, to their friends and colleagues who they knew were working on a physically dangerous or emotionally draining story. It was common to send a paper-wide email remembering a parent or loved one who had died, and to have our kids pop in and out of Zooms. Semel recalled how, when the stress felt overwhelming, he would go down to the basement of the paper’s old building, on 15th Street, with Steven Ginsberg (who started at the paper as a copy boy and eventually became a managing editor before decamping to edit The Athletic) and Nick Miroff (a longtime ace immigration reporter who is now my Atlantic colleague) for an impromptu game of Wiffle ball.

Martin Baron: Where Jeff Bezos went wrong with The Washington Post

Perhaps that’s why the paper’s White House reporting team, which knew it was unlikely to be impacted, wrote a letter to Bezos ahead of the cuts, beseeching him to intervene. Some of their most-read stories “relied on collaboration with all corners of the newsroom,” they said, because “our colleagues’ work helps lift up our own.”

Although many talented and hardworking people have left the paper in recent years, many talented and hardworking people have chosen to remain, and others have joined. The Post is still one of the best places to do important work. Journalists there turned down lucrative buyouts or other compelling offers to stay and fight for a place they love because they believe in the paper and the mission. (I would be remiss here if I did not mention that, bittersweetly, The Atlantic and the Times have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the current exodus.)

But each departure—whether by choice or buyout or, now, deliberate gutting—represents not just an individual loss but the erasure of years of institutional memory. How do you retain the culture of a place whose journalism absolutely sang because of—not in spite of—what my beloved editor Dan Eggen once joked was my corner of the building’s biggest problem: “Too much giggling.”

I arrived at the Post at the beginning of 2017, at a personal and professional nadir. My boyfriend and I had just broken up after nearly a decade together, and I was leaving my first job, at The New York Times. I had started right out of college, as Maureen Dowd’s researcher, and it was an amazing experience. She was a great boss and mentor, and she’s often still my first call for advice, on any topic. Yet I had long felt like a perpetual junior-varsity player, unable to shed the sheen of early assistanthood.

But the Post wanted me. Its team understood me—with all of my quirks and flaws and complications—and the newsroom welcomed me. Almost immediately, my editors pushed me toward opportunities I wouldn’t have dreamed of trying to seize—co-moderating a Washington Post–MSNBC Democratic debate in 2019, working on three projects that would each go on to win Pulitzer Prizes. Finally, I started believing in myself too.

The newsroom was a merry band of misfits, and I was one of their cheerful warriors. I was home.

My White House teammates regularly covered my shifts or swapped days with me so that I could meet the various demands of my complicated blended family. (I vividly remember racing out the door one afternoon to get to my then–second-grade stepdaughter’s performance in the ensemble of Alice in Wonderland as my desk-mates cheered me on.) When I miscarried between my two successful pregnancies, my colleagues called and texted daily to check in, and sent me cookies and soup. And when Trump finally agreed to an interview the month that I gave birth to my first daughter, in 2018, Phil Rucker and Josh Dawsey called me on maternity leave to invite me to join them because, they said, it was my interview too. (I ultimately declined—a combination of a challenging C-section recovery, postpartum depression, and abject horror at how the president might react if I began leaking milk in the Oval Office. In my absence, Trump told Rucker and Dawsey that he wished me well, but that I had always been very nasty to him.)

I am hardly unique. Andrew Golden, who covers the Washington Nationals for the paper, met and fell in love with his now-wife at the Post. (His hiring was also a full-circle moment for his family, and his granddad—a native Washingtonian and avid sports fan—saves every story he writes in cardboard boxes.) In 2007, Carlos Lozada, the paper’s longtime book critic, took the hardest job he’d ever had, as national-security editor, and then found out that same month that his oldest sister was dying of cancer—and his bosses told him: Go—take whatever time you need. Don’t worry about vacation days. Don’t worry about the job. We can sort that all out. “They all just covered for me, and that was everything,” Lozada, who now works for the Times, told me. “I got to spend a lot of time with my sister in the final days, and I’ll never, ever stop being grateful to The Washington Post for that.”

Erin Cox, who covers Maryland politics for the paper and whose husband, Rick Maese, covers sports, had a near-fatal heart attack just 10 weeks after giving birth to her third baby. The newsroom rallied around their family, sending money and food and support. Colleagues paid for—among other things—three weeks of summer camp for their 6-year-old daughter, whose scary August was suddenly overshadowed by memories of going to the pool, making kites, and laughing with new friends. One business reporter with whom Cox had never spoken showed up at her door bearing a multipart vegetarian feast. Cox’s editor brought her college-aged daughter by to offer babysitting services. The Post filled up a meal train for three months, leaving her book club with no remaining slots. (They settled for a gift card.)

“I mean,” she told me now, over the phone, “I had a tube in my throat dripping chemicals onto my heart to coax back enough function so that maybe I could one day walk up a flight of stairs, and you know what I felt? Overwhelmed by love.”

When The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg—who interned during two summers at the Post before taking on the night-cops beat—approached me in the summer of 2024 about joining this magazine, I was intrigued. I had always wanted to be a magazine writer, and I had subscribed to The Atlantic a few years before, sick of hitting the paywall when there were just so many stories I wanted to read.

The job he was offering was the one I had imagined for myself since I was a kid reading those Style-section greats. But I also subconsciously thought the process was going to end with me telling him, truthfully, You’re offering me my dream job, but I already have my dream job, and the tie goes to the home team.

I realized, though, that the Post wasn’t the same paper that had recruited me eight years before, and that I didn’t want to work for an owner and publisher who couldn’t articulate a vision and confused contempt for the newsroom with a business plan.

I love The Atlantic. I’m writing stories that feel both challenging and fulfilling. But even so, I also miss the Post. And as I watch the deliberate dismantling of the paper of the Graham family, of Woodward and Bernstein, of Marty Baron, of so many of my best friends, my grief is still visceral, my anger still raw.

Lozada told me he loves his new job at the Times, but the Post will always be special to him, too: “I worked there for 17 years, and I still think of the Post in terms of ‘we.’ Even when I’m talking about it now, I say, ‘I can’t believe we did this.’”

“The Post is still my ‘we,’” he continued. “It will always be my ‘we.’”

But, really, the Post is all of our “we”—the journalists fighting for it, the ones competing against it, those of us in the diaspora, and especially the community that counts on it and the nation that turns to it. We deserve so much better.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Early in my career, a mother came to my office to discuss her daughter’s calculus grade. When parents make this kind of request, I try to manage expectations by saying that as a school administrator, I have never changed a grade. Still, hopeful parents persist. In this case, the student had received a B, which her mother saw as a blemish on her otherwise spotless transcript. “I’m worried about how this will look to colleges,” she told me. “Is there any extra credit she can do?”

I explained that it’s okay to earn a B in a challenging course, and that her daughter might benefit from the experience of not being perfect. The mother looked at me as if I had suggested her child take up base jumping. “She’s never gotten a B before,” she said. “I don’t know how she’ll handle it.”

That kind of exchange perfectly captures a paradox of contemporary parenting: In trying to protect their children from any hint of failure, many parents risk making them more fragile. For years, parents and psychologists have been debating how much parental support is too much. But the stakes feel different now. In a world rife with anxiety, intensive parenting has become even more intensive, and some parents are deploying ever more sophisticated strategies to manage their children’s lives—initiating protracted grade appeals, trying to protect their child’s self-esteem by finding a part for everyone in a play, carefully curating extracurriculars to optimize their kid’s future. This happens even as teens take their first steps away from home and into independent adulthood. (Some parents, for instance, now hire “rush consultants” to help guide their kid through the process of getting into a sorority.)

Too many parents, probably unwittingly, are conditioning their kids to be afraid of losing. But experiencing failure and learning to recover from it are prerequisites for long-term success and, crucially, for mental health.

In explaining this to people, I’ve taken to drawing an analogy from immunology and the concept of “acquired immunity”—the body’s ability to recognize and fight off pathogens and other threats it has previously encountered. Consider peanuts allergies: For years, pediatricians told parents to avoid exposing children to peanuts and other known allergens during infancy, believing that this would protect kids from dangerous allergic reactions. This advice coincided, though, with a spike in severe peanut allergies. The guidance was reversed in 2017, and since then, researchers have found that peanut allergies have meaningfully declined. Scientists studying food allergies theorize that when a person is exposed early to an allergen, their body can learn that the allergen is harmless, just as a body’s immune system learns to produce antibodies when it encounters a weakened form of a virus through vaccination. The next time a person encounters that pathogen, they’re protected.

I’ve come to believe that failure works in a comparable way—that it is in a child’s best interest to be exposed early to manageable setbacks, so they can develop what we might call “failure immunity,” the psychological antibodies that allow them to face future disappointments without falling apart. This requires practice—specifically, practice at encountering obstacles and pushing through them. You can’t develop perseverance if you’ve never had to persevere.

Ann S. Masten, a developmental psychologist, describes resilience as “ordinary magic,” the result of normal developmental processes rather than extraordinary personal qualities. But those processes require what she calls “adaptive systems,” one of the most important of which involves the capacity to learn to cope with stress. Children who are consistently shielded from everyday challenges don’t get to practice this coping. When they inevitably encounter larger disappointments—a college rejection, a romantic breakup—they might lack the psychological fortitude to handle it.

The consequences of never failing show up in children’s mental health. Many young people feel enormous pressure to be perfect, and this perfectionism can have a serious cost. When children absorb the message that failure is catastrophic, even minor mistakes can feel unbearable. I’ve seen students fall apart over a single poor test result. “That’s not me,” a tearful student recently told me. “I’m not someone who gets bad grades.”

Read: Perfectionism can become a vicious cycle in families

This is what happens when we deny children the opportunity to develop failure immunity. They don’t learn that disappointment is survivable, that mistakes are instructive, and that temporary misfortune is, well, temporary.

I was a young instructor at Outward Bound, where I led backcountry expeditions in the Minnesota Boundary Waters, when I first began to understand failure immunity. The first Outward Bound school was developed more than 80 years ago, and was inspired in part by the rescue service at Gordonstoun, a Scottish boarding school—where, alongside their academic studies, students joined emergency-response teams to fight fires, search for lost hikers, and assist with maritime rescues. A core principle of Outward Bound is that “young people grow when they take on real challenges.” The program doesn’t assign letter grades. But if you aren’t paying attention when your instructor demonstrates how to set up a tent, you might leave your groundsheet exposed; when rain soaks your sleeping bag, you quickly learn the importance of tucking the groundsheet under the tent. You learn because you have to, typically by messing up first. In other words, the program is a crash course in failure immunity.

How can parents help children develop this sort of resilience? The first step is to resist the urge to rescue. When a child struggles with homework, a parent’s instinct might be to provide answers. When a kid encounters a difficult teacher, a parent might want to intervene. When they break a school rule and receive a consequence, a parent might fire off emails to administrators complaining of unfairness. But each intervention sends a message to the child: You can’t handle this.

Choosing not to step in doesn’t mean abandoning children to weather challenges alone. It means providing support while still allowing them to experience stress. When one of my daughters was in high school, she regularly lost sleep over English papers. She worshipped her teacher and didn’t want to disappoint them, so she wrote entire drafts that she would toss out, weeping, saying that her ideas weren’t good enough. As a parent, I was gutted to see this repeatedly unfolding, and I found myself wanting to insert myself—to either help with the draft or beg the teacher for some sort of absolution. It turned out, however, that this struggle was part of my daughter’s writing process. She recently mused about how much easier college has been, given the way she “tortured” herself over writing in high school. It was painful, yet somehow important and necessary for her.

Parents can also normalize failure as part of a meaningful life. Instead of treating mistakes as shameful secrets, we can proudly claim them as integral to our stories. My own kids have heard about my failed bids for a job, about school initiatives that have flopped, about times I fell short as a boss. I share these stories not to burden them but to help put failure in perspective. Research on the theory of social learning, by the psychologist Albert Bandura and others, shows that children develop coping strategies by observing how their parents respond to adversity. When parents model resilience—acknowledging disappointment while showing that they can solve problems and regulate their emotions—children learn these same skills.

Perhaps most important, parents would do well to examine their own relationship with failure. Many parents’ anxieties about their kid stem from a personal fear—that a bad grade means their child won’t get into a good college, that a stumble today could derail their future. But my experience tells me that the opposite is true. The kid who gets straight A’s through high school may struggle more in college than the one who foundered in ninth grade, figured out what went wrong, and then kept going. When we allow kids the satisfaction of overcoming hurdles on their own, we give them something more powerful and durable than a perfect transcript or an undefeated season: confidence in their ability to recover and come back stronger.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/real-estate-listing-ai-slop/685871/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first, the idea of using AI to create real-estate-listing pictures seemed like a decent proposition to Kati Spaniak, an Illinois-based agent. Like anyone who works on commission, real-estate agents are under tremendous pressure to reduce overhead costs, and a tool that produces images of a furnished home—without an agent having to actually furnish it—could save thousands of dollars. More and more brokers seem to have the same idea: A recent survey of Realtors found that nearly 70 percent of the participants had used AI.

Spaniak thought she had the ideal candidate for trying out the tech: a house in a suburb north of Chicago that had tremendous appeal on paper but looked terrible in photos when it was empty. “The house really needed quite a bit of work,” she told me. So she ordered some “virtually staged” photos that used AI to add furniture, wall hangings, and stacks of coffee-table books. But when potential buyers began showing up, Spaniak noticed a problem. Visitors seemed disappointed, even disoriented. “They don’t even really recognize why they’re upset,” she said. “They just feel let down.”

For homeseekers, the rise of the AI-assisted listing is not necessarily catastrophic. Fake imagery in home sales are like heavily edited photos on a dating profile—people are going to realize they’ve been fooled as soon as they walk in the door. And a level of manipulation has long been baked into real estate: wide-angle lenses to make spaces look bigger, aerosol sprays that smell like freshly baked cookies to suggest the presence of cozy homemakers, half-filled closets to imply a surplus of storage space.

But every successful broker knows that a sale isn’t made just on facts such as square footage and the number of bedrooms—it’s made on feelings, both implicit and latent, like FOMO (“This one will go fast”) or security (“You wouldn’t even need to lock your doors”). Vacant homes are carefully staged to help the unimaginative project themselves into a role: homeowner with a bungalow full of kids on a cul-de-sac, urban sophisticate in a downtown loft. Like a cherished item of clothing, the right home can allow a buyer to feel like the person they want to be. That’s why many tend not to object to an agent’s subtle manipulations; they get that they’re being nudged toward something they already desire. “Your whole goal when you’re selling a house is to get people in the door feeling emotional,” Spaniak said, “like they’re going to raise their families there.”

From this perspective, the unnameable distress caused by home-listing images fabricated in a data center is likely less about the superficial concern over misleading photos and more about something else: the psychological function of a home, and the dreams that buyers carry with them when they go out to find one.

The most flagrant AI real-estate imagery—hallucinated trees, staircases that don’t seem to go anywhere—can potentially run afoul of laws against false advertising, which forbid concealing substantial defects, such as, say, a crack in the house’s foundation. But AI photos fall along a spectrum of realism: Some are cartoonishly fake, whereas others can be nearly lifelike; some are labeled as using virtual enhancements, and others aren’t. In the listing that Spaniak showed me, furniture seems to hover over the floor without quite touching it, and cloth drapes as if it’s immune to gravity; still, a casual browser looking on their phone may not spot the nuances. Homebuyers tend to be more sensitive than the law, which is still largely unsettled in regards to the topic. Even in cases where use of AI photos is currently legal, many people seem to detest the results.

Many of those who revile AI-generated images can’t quite put a finger on what it is they don’t like. When an AI-inflected mural went up in London last year, Brits from across the political spectrum protested, even as some admitted they didn’t know what, exactly, they were protesting. Psychologists have observed that AI images of humans fall into the “uncanny valley”—a term that describes how almost-but-not-quite-realistic images of humans are far more unsettling than, say, a drawing of Charlie Brown. A study by researchers at Indiana University and the University of Duisburg-Essen found that people are also creeped out by AI images of food. AI real-estate images seem to be just as unsettling. On Reddit, when a woman posted AI-created photos of a home for sale, one commenter said, “It looks like they built it in The Sims.”

Uncanny valley was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970, though the concept of the “uncanny” was popularized a century ago by Freud. Uncanny is a loose translation of Freud’s phrase unheimlich, which, incidentally, literally translates to “un-homely”: the opposite of evoking a feeling of comfort, security, and safety. In his 1919 essay about the topic, Freud includes examples such as the mysterious recurrence of a number in your life, and getting lost and somehow ending up back in the same place repeatedly—experiences that make one wonder whether the everyday might be subject to forces that elude apprehension or control.

As Spaniak learned, issues arise when you try to sell a living space by using technology that seems to have a knack for rattling people. A home really is a luxury good, in the sense that its value is based mostly on intangibles; the pride and coziness one feels in a home might have little to do with the shelter provided by the roof and four walls, any more than people wear Jordans for ankle support. For many people, home is, in the words of the architectural historian Paul Oliver, “the theatre of our lives”—and the marketing and imagery that agents use set a foundation for how people live once inside. As in any staged drama, there’s an element of pretend here, though it’s less make-believe than aspiration.

But aspirations are fragile. Psychologists who study the nature of ambition have consistently found that aspirations are motivating in proportion to their attainability. AI listing photos risk setting people up for disappointment by selling them on a dream of home that, by definition, they can never attain. A similar logic is illustrated in discussions about the danger of unrealistic beauty standards; once human desire has been calibrated to what doesn’t exist, what does exist can only disappoint. After all, although real-estate listings have always been somewhat aspirational, even the most heavily manipulated photos still reflect a grain of truth; the apartment really does look like that at the golden hour, if only for 20 minutes a day, and your home could be as sophisticated as the professional stager made it look, if you found a spare $180,000 lying around to blow on Danish furniture and some framed Twombly prints. You won’t, but you could.

What might be taboo to admit in America, where individual accomplishment has long been exalted, is that many lofty ambitions—striking it rich, snagging the ideal partner, living in the picture-perfect home—are more useful as possibility than actuality. People tend to embrace the idealized versions of themselves, their homes, or their lives as the bounds of their potential, not as its median. We don’t necessarily need to achieve these things; we only need to feel that we could. Your kitchen counter might be covered with half-full LaCroix cans, and you might Google “horizontal cracks basement wall bulging” every time you do laundry, but the thing that makes it all bearable, even heimlich, is that you know the house could look like you dreamed it would when you signed that lease or mortgage. Take that hope away and a home becomes just a house: a big box for storing one’s socks and USB cords.

Many real-estate agents, to their credit, seem to instinctively understand this challenge. Though AI-generated listing photos have gained some traction, the agents I spoke with think the practice is unlikely to be adopted on a wider scale. After her experience with the tech, Spaniak now recommends that sellers use real-life staging and professional photography. Only amateurs, another agent told me, would try to cut corners by using AI photos. If some people in the real-estate industry insist on shoehorning the tech into listings, it will likely make the process of buying or selling less efficient and less profitable, Ayelet Fishbach, a professor of behavioral science and marketing at the University of Chicago, told me: “Both buyers and sellers lose.”

If AI listing photos ultimately flop, it might partly be a matter of bad timing. The philosopher Ernst Bloch once observed that the uncanny had its pleasures, but entertainment such as creepy stories were best enjoyed in “too cozy” conditions, when one was “personally secure.” People have a higher tolerance, even a craving, for the disconcerting when they are comfortable. If AI photos had hit the market during the socially placid and economically flush ’90s, they might have exuded a more utopian aura, more Jetsons than Terminator.

Instead, they’re spreading at a time when many Americans are financially strained, alienated, and pessimistic about the future. Ironically, a portion of these contemporary anxieties stem from the spread of AI itself, including the threats it may pose to the next generation’s capacity for critical thinking and wide swaths of the white-collar economy. Under these conditions, maybe it’s inevitable that AI real-estate photos would seem more like ominous transmissions from a post-human future, and less like a harmless way for an agent to save a buck.</div>

            <h2>Why This Shutdown Is Different</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/ice-government-shutdown-minnesota/685874/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the previous government shutdown, President Trump reveled in the chance to fire federal workers, expand his executive authority, and steer taxpayer dollars toward his allies and away from his perceived political enemies. After a record-setting 43 days of gridlock—during which Trump pursued those goals with varying degrees of success—several Democrats abandoned their quest to force Republicans to negotiate a health-care deal, and voted to end the shutdown. As he signed the bill, flanked by congressional Republicans, who had largely unified around the idea that they would not entertain a policy negotiation while the government was closed, Trump congratulated his party on a “very big victory” over the Democrats.

The second government shutdown of Trump’s second term ended today with much less fanfare and bravado from the commander in chief. This time, Trump negotiated both before and after the government was closed, going so far as to call Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to work out a deal on the main point of contention: his administration’s mass-deportation campaign.

Trump is largely the same person that he was four months ago, when the previous shutdown began. (If you need evidence, in recent days, he has abruptly announced plans to close and completely rebuild the Kennedy Center, suggested that he wants to “nationalize” the midterm elections, and threatened Iran with an attack from “a massive Armada.”) But his push to quickly resolve the latest shutdown highlights how much the political landscape on immigration has shifted following daily, videotaped clashes between masked federal agents and Minneapolis residents, two of whom were killed last month.

“I’m glad we got this done,” Trump said from the Oval Office as he signed the bill and hailed the various programs the legislation would fund. He didn’t address the difficulties that come next: negotiations over accountability measures for federal immigration agents and a lapse in funding for the Department of Homeland Security if a deal can’t be reached within 10 days.

Although Republicans have generally opposed considering policy concessions as a prerequisite for opening the government, Trump and his allies had little choice but to treat this shutdown differently, Doug Heye, a Republican strategist, told me. Plunging public support for Trump’s immigration crackdown has reoriented the politics of government shutdowns; the political shift is a culmination of “all the things that we’ve seen on video, everything that America has reacted to in the past few weeks, when we’ve had two American citizens who have been killed,” he said. “Now when you talk about immigration, it is essentially being defined as what’s happening in Minneapolis, and most Republicans know that it’s bad for them.”

On January 24, Alex Pretti became the second American killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. Since then, the Trump administration has been looking for ways to contain the political fallout. Trump has dispatched the administration’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, to Minneapolis with explicit orders to calm tensions, had positive phone calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and expressed openness to de-escalating the aggressive tactics used by some federal agents. The president, though, has since begun to retreat from his conciliatory tone, taking to social media to attack Pretti and telling reporters that he is “not at all” pulling back from Minnesota.

But even as he began shifting away from de-escalation, Trump made clear that he was willing to work with Democrats to avoid another government shutdown. The bill that Trump signed today funds most of the government through the end of September and continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security until February 13. Lawmakers and the White House are supposed to use the next 10 days to negotiate broader reforms to DHS’s operations that Democrats say would be necessary before they vote for additional funding for the agency that is carrying out Trump’s mass-deportation effort.

Democrats, who emerged from the previous shutdown without achieving their goal of extending subsidies for health care, say that they are now determined to extract concrete changes in how the nation’s immigration authorities operate. “Immigration and border protection are core responsibilities of our government, but this version of ICE has strayed far beyond that core function,” Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote in a statement today after voting against the funding bill. She said that Congress should demand that DHS shift away from the “chaos and deadly consequences” of its current operations.

Democrats have threatened to withhold their votes on funding DHS beyond next week if their demands are not met. Although the department’s immigration push has been infused with tens of billions of dollars in funds from legislation Congress passed last year, a shutdown of operations could affect other parts of the department’s budget, including TSA and FEMA. Democrats are calling for changes that include requiring ICE agents to stop wearing masks and to obtain judicial warrants in immigration operations. They also want independent investigations of the killings of Pretti and Renee Good. Some are calling for the resignation of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has drawn bipartisan criticism for accusing Pretti and Good of “domestic terrorism” hours after each was killed.

Democrats’ push may already be making an impact. Noem said yesterday that ICE agents working in Minneapolis will begin wearing body cameras immediately and that agents across the country will be doing the same once funding becomes available. But Democrats are likely to face more resistance to their other demands. Asked about judicial warrants today, Trump was noncommittal. “I haven’t even thought about it,” he told reporters. “I’m not thinking about search warrants.”

He deferred to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said that he opposed the call for judicial warrants. Graham pivoted to calling for a ban on sanctuary cities, something Trump said he will be pushing for as negotiations take place in the coming days. Other Republicans have rejected several Democratic requests as unrealistic or unworkable. Senate Majority Leader John Thune predicted that lawmakers would need to pass another extension of DHS funding before February 13, calling the prospect of making significant reforms by next week an “impossibility.”

But, buoyed by the newfound leverage they have to draw Trump to the negotiating table, many Democrats are looking to exert maximum pressure in the coming days. There is disagreement between the Senate and the House, as well as between more moderate and more progressive Democrats, about how hard of a line to draw in the upcoming discussions. House Democrats largely opted not to support the funding agreement negotiated by their Senate counterparts, with some saying that funding DHS at current levels even for a few days would be inappropriate. But Democrats—who have at times opposed government shutdowns due to the potential harm to federal workers and those who rely on the social safety net—are navigating new terrain as they try to rein in Trump.

Recent changes narrowing the kinds of tasks agencies can perform when funding lapses also mean that shutdowns have the potential to hit a larger number of Americans more harshly than before, Abigail André, the executive director of the Impact Project, told me. “The changes some agencies made to shutdown protocols made shutdowns more painful for communities and, therefore, more politically costly,” she said.

Trump has acknowledged that shutdowns can be a political liability. When Democrats claimed big victories in Virginia, New Jersey, Georgia, and elsewhere last year on an Election Day that fell during a shutdown, Trump told his fellow Republicans that the government’s closure had played “a big role” in the results. When Trump called Schumer last month to negotiate, the president said: “I hate shutdowns,” the minority leader told The New York Times. Schumer suggested that they cut a deal to rein in ICE. Trump was also hearing from members of his own party, who were reaching out privately to express their dismay over the scenes emerging from Minnesota. Several have spoken out publicly as well, laying the groundwork for negotiations.

When I asked the White House about Trump’s willingness to negotiate this time rather than dig in his heels as government funding lapsed, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not acknowledge the shift, instead blaming Democrats. “President Trump has been consistent—he wants the government open,” she told me. “Democrats should not try to use the American people as leverage to achieve their policy goals.”

But many Democrats say that they are simply following the lead of their constituents, who have shifted sharply against Trump’s immigration policies in recent weeks as masked federal agents have descended on American cities. A Fox News poll released last week found that 59 percent of voters say that ICE has been “too aggressive” in its deportation tactics, a 10-point jump since July.

Andrew O’Neill, the national advocacy director for Indivisible, a progressive organizing group, said in a statement that Republicans are now “on their back foot,” and warned Democrats that voting for any legislation that does not overhaul DHS would constitute a “failure to meet this moment.” Alluding to the street protests that have frustrated ICE’s efforts in Minneapolis and elsewhere, he said: “The public has done its part, and now Congress must do theirs.”

Heye, the Republican strategist, told me that although Trump has an ability to control the news cycle around him, the immigration debate is dominating in an election year that Republicans had promised they would use to address voters’ concerns about the cost of living. Avoiding a prolonged shutdown over unpopular immigration tactics is part of a broader effort to refocus as the midterms approach, he said: “The fact that Americans have been killed means that this will have a longer political memory,” he said. “Republicans should be talking about, Here’s what we’re trying to do to fix costs, and all of this gets in their way.”

With nine months to go until the midterm elections, President Trump’s campaign to subvert them is escalating. His administration has recently taken a series of steps that have election officials, observers, and administrators deeply and rightfully concerned about the prospects for improper interference with the election process.

In October, I published an in-depth article on how the president could interfere (and already was interfering) with the midterm elections. Since then, the reasons for worry have become more urgent. In the past two weeks, the FBI conducted a search in a major Democratic county in a swing state, in service of debunked theories about fraud in the 2020 election; the Justice Department attempted to extort voter rolls from another Democratic state under threat of armed occupation; and the president floated plans to “nationalize” elections. Trump has tried to subvert an election before, but these efforts are earlier, more organized, and—crucially—employing the power of the federal government to help him achieve his personal political goals.

Yesterday, Trump spoke with Dan Bongino, the podcaster turned FBI deputy director turned podcaster, and called for his party to seize control of voting in states. “These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally,” Trump said, reprising an oft-used and incorrect claim. (Voting by noncitizens is rare and does not amount to enough to swing elections.) “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over’—we should take over the voting in at least, many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked, and they’re counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win.”

The executive branch has no constitutional or statutory role in states’ election administration, so the call for “nationalization” is an assertion of power that the federal government does not have, a hallmark of other recent White House ploys. Trump’s declaration that “Republicans” could do it may be a suggestion that Congress take action, but it also points to the partisan aims of his attack.

Trump’s efforts to prove that he won in 2020 are all premised on false claims, yet he continues to try to drum up evidence for a conclusion he’s already reached. “You’re gonna see something in Georgia,” he told Bongino, referring to a search this past Wednesday at the Fulton County election center, in Atlanta, where agents looked for records including ballots, tabulator tapes, and voter rolls from the 2020 election. Immediately after that election, Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that he won Georgia, and when his legal efforts to challenge the result fell short, he called the Republican secretary of state and asked him to “find” almost 12,000 votes. (Trump and some associates were charged with racketeering in Fulton County as a result, but the case was dismissed last year.) The search is a stunning intrusion into local election administration. “It’s a five-alarm fire,” as one Arizona Republican election official told my colleagues Sarah Fitzpatrick and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez.

Since the search, more troubling information has emerged. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has no obvious role in the FBI or domestic-election oversight but has been a proponent of bogus fraud claims about the 2020 election, was present for the operation, which she said in a letter to Congress was at Trump’s behest. The New York Times reports that Gabbard met with some of the FBI officers the following day and put Trump on speakerphone for a chat with them—a serious departure from normal practice, and a move that emphasizes the appearance of inappropriate pressure: a federal law-enforcement agency acting as a political agent of the president in a nakedly partisan operation. (Bongino’s own return to partisan podcasting, just weeks after leaving his post as No. 2 at the FBI, demonstrates how politics has infected the bureau.)

As Trump continues to clash with local officials in Minnesota, he also claims that he was cheated out of votes there. “I feel that I won Minnesota—I think I won it all three times,” he said. “I won it all three times, in my opinion.” On January 24, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Governor Tim Walz demanding that the state turn over its voter rolls to the Justice Department as a condition of the federal government ending its violent crackdown in Minneapolis. Since May 2025, the DOJ has ordered 44 states and the District of Columbia to hand over voter rolls, though it has no statutory right to them. Many states, including Minnesota, have resisted.

Bob Bauer, a veteran Democratic election lawyer, argues that although Bondi’s letter appears to yoke together two unrelated questions—election integrity and immigration enforcement—the Trump administration may not see them as separate, but rather as an opening to interfering with elections using federal agents. “The administration’s lawyers might view the potential deployment of ICE as an option allowing for the fielding of what one advocate describes as ‘essentially an army’ charged with ensuring election security through immigration law enforcement,” he wrote this week.

As bleak as these developments are, a few hopeful signs for the midterms have emerged. First, Trump has been publicly setting expectations for poor results for Republicans, a sign that he may be resigning himself somewhat to a loss. Second, the president’s attempt to force gerrymanders in GOP-controlled states, in order to help preserve the House majority, seems to be ending up as basically a wash, after Democrat-controlled states responded in kind. Third, an election is at greatest danger of interference when the margin of victory is narrow, and Americans’ growing disapproval of the president’s handling of immigration and the economy has buoyed Democrats on the generic ballot for Congress. An old joke goes that the election administrator’s prayer is, “Lord, let this election not be close.” Even as Trump tries to tamper with elections, his actions in office make it more likely that the prayer is answered.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Problem With Using AI in Your Personal Life

More and more, large language models are relieving people of the burden of reading and writing, in school and at work but also in group chats and email exchanges with friends. In many areas, guidelines are emerging: Schools are making policies on AI use by students, and courts are trying to settle the law about AI and intellectual property. In friendship and other interpersonal uses, however, AI is still the Wild West. We have tacit rules about which movies you wait to see with your roommate and who gets invited to the lake house, but we have yet to settle anything comparable regarding, for example, whether you should use ChatGPT to reply to somebody’s Christmas letter. That seems like an oversight.

Take a look. It’s so cold in Florida that iguanas are falling out of trees. Alan Taylor compiled photos of trappers gathering the cold-stunned invasive reptiles by the thousands.

Read. “My extraordinary great-great-grandfather obtained his liberty at some point before the Civil War,” Eugene Robinson writes. But how did Henry Fordham become a free man?

This article originally stated that the federal government has no constitutional or statutory role in states&#39; election administration; in fact, the executive branch has no such role.

            <h2>Which Washington Landmark Will Donald Trump Destroy Next?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/dc-renovation-projects-donald-trump/685870/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alas, the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts! We barely knew ye!

The president announced on Truth Social that the recently renamed center will close on July 4 for two full years of renovations. No better way to celebrate 250 years as a nation than by shutting down our center for the performing arts! Most high schools, given the opportunity to shut down their performing-arts departments, don’t view it as an exciting, patriotic celebration, and prefer to have a bake sale. But I am told that this is just how the Founders hoped we would celebrate. (If you remember that John Adams note about how to commemorate the Fourth of July, right after “fireworks,” he suggested “or making it difficult, if not impossible, for people to see Opera, Ballet, Symphonic Performances, Touring Productions of Broadway Musicals, and Sometimes Shen Yun.”)

Everywhere you look in Washington, D.C., buildings are getting their names rejiggered (the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace), their wings clipped (RIP East Wing of the White House), or both. And of course, we must not forget the Triumphal Arch—a possibly 250-foot-tall edifice (One foot for each year! We’d better hope the country doesn’t go on much longer!) that, when complete, will reportedly dwarf the Lincoln Memorial.

Is any building safe? I fear it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable Donald J. Trump AND is slapped on every marquee—but what happens after that? Here are my best guesses.

Donald J. Trump and Washington National Cathedral: Why should George Washington be the only one to have his name on a house of prayer? Trump’s team will also improve all of the windows, which currently are full of lots of little tiny bits of “stained” glass (was new, pristine glass not available?) that make it difficult to see in or out.

Also, instead of a large, depressing wooden carving of some Middle Eastern man in a loincloth being justly punished by the state, we will have something uplifting, like a big golden letter T, maybe a big R, possibly a U, and then a nice MP to round the whole thing off. (This move might result in audiences deserting the building, but then we can demolish it and put in a golf course.)

Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace: The roof of this building will be repainted as a world map, with all of the territories Trump is eyeing for the United States marked for viewers’ convenience. It will be used to house the members of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, who will have been kidnapped by an elite squadron of Trump Peacekeeping Forces and threatened with repeat screenings of Melania until they produce a Nobel Prize for Mr. Trump.

Donald J. Trump Federal Bureau of Investigations: This building will be torn down on the grounds that it is an eyesore from the 1960s, an era when it was believed that a single Watergate-level scandal would be enough to end a presidency, and replaced with either the actual Parthenon from Athens (the ultimate in classical architecture) or the fake Parthenon from Tennessee (Kash Patel and his girlfriend can bring it back on their government jet so that they will be able to mark their latest Nashville excursion as “business travel.”)

The Donald J. Trump and Washington Monument: At first, I thought Trump would simply slap his name on this noteworthy obelisk, but I actually think he will do another Triumphal Arch move and build a much bigger one, all in brass, right next to it. But not too close. Any deaths of birds that fly into it will be offset by the fact that Trump is saving their relatives from windmills.

The Donald J. Trump United States Treasury: Simply putting Donald Trump’s name on the whole Treasury will save everyone the trouble of stashing money in special accounts in Qatar; they should have thought of it earlier.

The Donald J. Trump and Jefferson Memorial: The quotations about how “indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep forever” will be allowed to remain, but a little animatronic statue of Stephen Miller will be installed next to them, shaking his head to show he doesn’t agree.

The Donald J. Trump Pentagon: Donald Trump wants this to be a hexagon for reasons he won’t articulate, and Pete Hegseth lives to oblige!

The Donald J. Trump and Vietnam Veterans Memorial: What is this big, depressing V made from dark stone covered in little tiny names? Suckers and losers, no doubt. Make it a big T instead, all white marble, with the names of donors in gold letters.

The Donald J. Trump Supreme Court: Instead of blind justice standing on the steps (we can do better than some kind of visually impaired woman who is probably dispensing justice to any and all comers without fear or favor), this building will now feature one of those guys covered in gold paint who pretends to be a statue, so he can see who is trying to get justice and let the majority know Trump’s feelings about him so they can vote accordingly.

The Korean War Veterans Memorial: Trump will leave this one alone because he forgot it was there.

The Donald J. Trump and Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial: Demolished, obviously.

The Donald J. Trump National Archives: These will first be closed to the public and then scanned carefully for any maps leading to treasure; they will be reopened free to the public only if they contain nothing of value.

The Donald J. Trump U.S. Capitol: This will also be closed for the next two years for “renovations,” except to peaceful and patriotic tour groups. See if Mike Johnson dares to object!

The Donald J. Trump and Smithsonian Institution: After all of the exhibitions have been clawed through to remove all evidence of a very objectionable, political thing called “history,” these buildings will be left temporarily intact until reduced crowds drive a move for renovations. Then Trump will announce that they are being closed on July 4 as a special patriotic tribute (“Those who don’t learn history will … make America great again!”), to be reopened after two years as an imperial palace. Just as the Founders would have wished!

The Donald J. Trump and Lincoln Memorial: Trump will add a large gold statue of himself standing with his hand on Abraham Lincoln’s shoulder to imply that Lincoln is sitting in Trump’s chair and Trump is being patient about it, but his patience might run out soon. Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address will remain visible, but just barely, because the text of Trump’s Second Inaugural Address will be superimposed on it in a very small font to make room for all of the text, obscuring the words of the man who appealed to the better angels of our nature.

This article originally suggested that Abraham Lincoln’s statement about the “better angels of our nature” appeared in his Second Inaugural Address. In fact, those words appeared in his First Inaugural Address.</div>

You talk about getting laid off as though it&#39;s a bad thing. IRL it&#39;s a bit more nuanced than that.

While it&#39;s true that people who get laid off stop getting paychecks (which most of us would immediately miss!) it does come with a gigantic upside.

If you get laid off, then you don&#39;t have to go to work anymore. That results in you getting a whole third of the remaining grains in your hourglass-of-life back. Those 8 hours a day of your one-and-only limited life, no longer being wasted on misery.

Those responsible for tracking the people who have just been sacked, have been sacked.FTFY

Those responsible for tracking the people who have just been sacked, have been sacked.

Remember &quot;I will replace you with a very small shell script&quot;?

We&#39;re essentially replacing people with a very big script now. But they are being replaced. The inevitable has arrived.

They weren&#39;t sacked for writing a script, they were sacked for accessing private HR data. Big difference. Most companies would have sacked them.

It seemed like there were layoffs every Friday for a period of time. When you were getting the axe they would disable you in Active Directory by adding an underscore in front of your name. So, the internal website, &quot;Death Watch&quot;, would just look for accounts that were changed to _username and list them on the website.

&quot;The new OS won&#39;t be compatible with all existing Chromebook hardware&quot;

Like, too big to fit on the drive incompatible?  Or like, we checked a version number and we and our partners have decided that you&#39;re too cheap to use our new OS?

There are two things here.  One is getting an OS that can be installed on most computers out there, unlike ChromeOS, which is limited in that area.  The other is having either an upgrade path for Chrome OS, or a merge path for ChromeOS into this Android.  Ideally, if it can take both, that would be great

One option could be to have different configurations of the OS depending on the resources available.  If one is doing it on a barebones Chromebook w/ say, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, then just install

> There are two things here. One is getting an OS that can be installed on most computers out there, unlike ChromeOS, which is limited in that area

ChromeOS is pretty portable. There have been multiple, successful, projects to create generic installers for it and Google even decided to bless one. ChromeOS is basically a Gentoo fork that&#39;s been heavily locked down. The only proprietary part that talks to hardware in the entire system is their display system, which is true of Android too. Google&#39;s blessed v

The problem with ChromeOS is Google having to maintain two Linux distributions. The only reason it even exists at all is that Chrome for Android was shit at the time at which ChromeOS was released. Its entire purpose for existing is running desktop Chrome on cheap laptops. Now that Chrome for Android is basically OK, it has no reason to exist. Unfortunately for Google they are going to have to support it for another decade, but that support could be pretty bad and probably still meet any notional promises t

Talking about from a platform standpoint, there are currently only two, potentially three platforms that Android would have to support: Arm, x86 and maybe RISC-V.  I understand that Arm has many variants, but they just have to focus on Arm8, and maybe Arm7, depending on how far back they want to support.  That would limit the number of vendors to about 3-4 - Qualcomm, AMD, Nvidia, MediaTek, unless other CPU vendors wanted to make their own hardware port of the lower levels of Linux that need to understand e

ChromeOS and Android are both based on Linux, so run on most stuff with a bit of effort. ChromeOS Flex is the version for general computers and is decently compatible.

This seems like a storm in a teacup. They are talking about 5-6 years of overlap, which isn&#39;t untypical for this kind of big OS shift. 10 years of support isn&#39;t massive either, it&#39;s what Microsoft offers for Windows. Support only means fixing security issues and existing bugs.

Itâ(TM)s finally the year of Linux on the desktop. And it will be locked down so tight that it can only install software that someone else thinks users should be allowed to. At least Microsoft allows users to make choices about what software they run. Maybe this will at least convince more people to try Ubuntu.

Well, the general public i.e. those not addicted to Apple toys, are at least pretty familiar w/ the Android interface, be it on phones or tablets.  It won&#39;t be a major leap to have that working for laptops.  In fact, an added benefit of that to computer makers: they can now make Arm laptops from various vendors - Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD (whenever their Arm offering is out) for starters, and any of the other myriad Arm CPU vendors out there.  Instead of the x86 duopoly of AMD and Intel

Columbia computer science professor Jason Nieh, who interviewed Google engineers as a witness in the case, testified that Aluminium requires a heavier software stack and more powerful hardware to run.This just doesn&#39;t make sense. We&#39;re supposed to believe that the software now running on phones requires more hardware than the software now running on laptops?

There are millions upon millions of perfectly good computers that are now going to landfills because of that, and they could all have Flex running on them if it wasn&#39;t for Google&#39;s short-sighted strategy.

You&#39;re not wrong but this is being driven by the community. Word it differently and take their money because that is what makes the consumer sleep at night.It also doesn&#39;t hurt that they stock tanked in the last couple days.

There is a big difference. Since it is tied to your subscription You would not be able to use it anymore if it was removed from their portfolio. This way people will still be able to access and use it.FTFA from the prior story:&quot;Weâ(TM)re contacting you to let you know that Adobe will be discontinuing Adobe Animate on March 1, 2026. As an existing Animate user, you may continue to use Animate, but please note that technical support will no longer be available after March 1, 2027,&quot; states part of the email sent to users.So no, that is not different at all, so it&#39;s not a big difference, in fact it&#39;s no different.

I&#39;d still be open to alternatives for the sake of having a Plan B. Adobe has only proven they can always pull the rug. &quot;Yoink! Sux 2 B U! LOL!&quot;

Given how keen Alphabet is to kill off something that doesn&#39;t instantly earn billions, is this a hint this project is also at death&#39;s door?

There are lots of SQL already floating out there.  Why did Google feel the need to add yet another to the mix?  Does GoogleSQL genuinely offer benefits over others out there, or is it just not-invented-here syndrome?I know nothing about GoogleSQL/ZetaSQL, but its description from its GitHub page [github.com] describes it as an, &quot;Analyzer Framework for SQL.&quot;Furthermore, if you read TFS, you&#39;d know this is not a new project, merely just a new name.

They could have built at least a litte moat, I belive, if they&#39;d invested in making good software that works with chatgpt. Integrating chatgpt into your workflow isn&#39;t hard if you&#39;re a coder but very few people who use it are, and coders are the first to learn about the alternative ai&#39;s and start using them - and the mountains of shitty, scammy, insecure, subscription based chatgpt wrappers vibecoded in the last year by random weirdos trying to get rich without doing any work don&#39;t help built user&#39;s confide

In other words, it&#39;s not all that, though it can be useful. Basically, their actions just mean: here, see if you can use this to improve your productivity. We don&#39;t quite know what it can do for you, and if something breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

A more telling statistic would be the amount of money the AI companies are getting from selling their tat to other companies. The retail consumers do not seem excited and I do not think the AI companies give a flying rat&#39;s ass about retail consumers except as icing on the cake, if it is there. However CEOs seem to be having orgasms over it. Are they putting their money where their mouth has been? Does anyone have anywhere we can go to see these stats?

I wonder if this is why Nvidia has bailed (or looks to be bailling) on their pledge to invest $100 billion in OpenAI?It probably wouldn&#39;t be a good bet pouring all that money into a company whose market share is tending down that fast.

From Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis to Maine, ICE agents are leaving a trail of destruction and fear. The most important harms they leave behind are broken lives, injuries, and deaths. There are already important efforts in the works to hold them to account via criminal investigations and civil actions. Yet these actions will be hard to win. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are wreaking another, second-string harm, this one involving the destruction of personal property. This damage flagrantly violates another constitutional provision—and there is a clear and uncluttered legal pathway to address those harms that so far has not been invoked. It’s past time it was used.

ICE’s violent enforcement actions often involve the needless destruction of people’s personal property. The Fifth Amendment’s takings clause makes such property destruction unconstitutional. Demanding damages for these harms may seem to miss the mark, in the sense that they do not address the features that make ICE’s strategies so horrifying, specifically the physical violence against human beings. This is quite fair. But often there will simply be no other practical way for ICE’s victims to obtain redress, such that an action for property harms may well be the best, even the only, route available.

Take the case of Minneapolis resident ChongLy “Scott” Thao. In January, ICE agents battered down Thao’s door, dragged him out in his underwear, and handled him in a degrading, contemptuous, and very likely racist manner—before confirming that he was, as he said, a U.S. citizen. Thao surely ought to be able to seek damages for the grave harms to his person and dignity. The conservative Roberts court, however, has made such damages actions—called Bivens suits—extremely hard to win thanks to doctrines such as “qualified immunity.” The latter is a misleading name, as it is practically insurmountable in many cases. Some federal courts of appeals have even ruled that ICE agents are categorically immune from constitutional damages actions under all circumstances.

But the facts of Thao’s case are unlikely to prove outliers in coming weeks. ICE has developed an internal policy memo telling its officers that they can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judicial warrant. This policy, which perversely echoes the British colonial abuses that precipitated the American Revolution, invites the repetition of Thao’s ordeal around the nation. A key way to fight back would be lawsuits under the takings clause.

This is not the only kind of serious property damage ICE habitually engages in, though. From Arizona to Maine to Colorado, immigration agents have stopped people’s cars, smashed in windows, dragged out drivers, and left cars running on the street—in effect inviting their theft. In other cases, ICE agents have rammed private vehicles, using a tactic most police departments have banned as too dangerous, to make an arrest.

But there is an explicit constitutional prohibition against the federal government destroying property without “just compensation.” Again, it’s the takings clause. While it’s usually applied when the federal government exercises eminent domain and takes title to land, the takings clause also covers the government’s outright destruction of personal property. What’s more, there are no barriers to recovery akin to qualified immunity.

Applying the takings clause to the destruction of personal property by lawless federal agents makes a certain historical sense. At least one influential legal treatise–writer of the founding period, St. George Tucker, opined that the takings clause had been threaded into the Bill of Rights as a response to the military destruction of personal property during the Colonial-era wars. If Thao or other victims of ICE brought suit, that is, they’d arguably be walking in hallowed footprints.

Would courts be willing to entertain these claims today? Some courts of appeals have dismissed takings claims against state and local police on the theory that the takings clause only applies when government takes title to land. This is flat wrong. For example, the Supreme Court has held that a federal regulation requiring a raisin farmer to destroy a portion of his crop is a per se taking. The government destruction of things, that is, counts as a taking.

Other courts, more plausibly, have held that a takings claim can be brought only when a police officer is acting unreasonably in destroying property. In Thao’s case, and many others, agents’ claim that they are acting “reasonably” would be thwarted by body-cam footage, or the fact that their tactics violate well-established policing practices, such as don’t ram a suspect’s car to get it off the road. Indeed, there are now a trail of court victories on behalf of people whose houses have been damaged by SWAT raids.

If there was any doubt about such claims, it should be extinguished by the fact that Congress has identified precisely how such cases can be brought. It has designated the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as the right tribunal for takings claims over $10,000. Smaller claims are brought in the relevant district court. In both kinds of cases, federal law establishes a fee-shifting mechanism: A win for a plaintiff means that the government has to pay attorney’s fees. This fee-structure means that takings claims should be available even when litigants lack upfront fees for a lawyer, but have an otherwise strong case.

Property damage is, no doubt, a decidedly venal sin in comparison to the grave violations of civil and human rights for which ICE is responsible. But it is a sad fact that Congress and the courts have made it well-nigh impossible to sue if you are brutalized or injured by ICE—and straightforward to prevail if your personal property is busted up. In a moment of less acute emergency, there are good reasons to fix that topsy-turvy situation. In the bleak midst of ICE’s violent blizzard, we must use every lawful tool at our disposal to hit the brakes on its lawless destruction and desecration of Americans’ homes and lives.

            <h2>Hiding From ICE Was the Scariest Experience of My Life. What Happened Next Was Worse.</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, I traveled to Minneapolis to report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence. While there, I documented intense struggles between local residents and federal agents—an important story with deadly consequences. But I also heard constantly about another, equally important story: that of the thousands of immigrants who’ve made Minnesota their home and are trying to survive the federal occupation. Reaching people living in those conditions is difficult, precisely because their well-being depends on them staying out of sight. But after multiple attempts, I was connected with a man who has been hiding in his home for fear of being detained. To protect his identity, privacy, and safety, identifying details have been omitted. What follows is his account, originally told in Spanish, of his time in hiding—and the federal abduction of his son.

The most difficult day of my life was the day they grabbed my son.

I am from Guatemala. I left because economically, there is very little opportunity. Delinquency is high. You work, you get paid very little, and there are people waiting to rob you. I left my wife and my children and came here with my son so I could earn a little more and take care of my family back home.

We’ve lived in Minneapolis for seven years. Before the ICE raids intensified, my life was relaxing but full of work. I worked hard, and left my house knowing I would come back. I could walk outside during the day and at night. I slept for a few hours, made my breakfast, made my lunch to take to work the next day; that’s the life of an immigrant. Sundays were my only day of rest, but even then I worked doing laundry, grocery shopping, going to Walmart, talking to people, getting to know the community.

When I arrived in Minneapolis, it felt like my country. I saw people who looked like me. I got used to the snow, the cold, working in all conditions. We worked hard for a few good months to save, then kept working through the winter anyway.

I used to watch Americans buy a few things—soap, bread, eggs, milk. But Hispanic families? We filled two full carts. We move the economy. We move money here, and we send money back to our families. That’s why it hurts so much to be seen like this now. We are not delinquents. We are hard workers. We work from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sometimes we work with lamps on our foreheads. All to help the families we left behind.

On Jan. 6, we woke up early. I didn’t want to leave the house and go to work that day. I told my son that, but he said he wanted to go. He left around 8:45 in the morning. At 10 a.m., his boss called me and asked, “Where is your son? Have you heard from him?” That’s when my heart dropped.

As a father, I wanted to go out and look for him. I wanted to do everything possible. But seeing how things are, I had to avoid going outside. Later, I was watching the news. I saw a video from detention. I saw my son there, chained by his feet. That’s when I knew. That’s when I realized they had him. That image stays with you.

My son is 36 years old. He is a special-needs person. He doesn’t talk. After suffering a stroke, his tongue is stuck. One of his eyes is dead. He works because he needs to work. Here in Minneapolis, he was in medical therapy, learning how to use his jaw again. He was being treated by a doctor here. This is where we were helping him. This is where he was receiving care.

And suddenly, we knew nothing. They told me he was going to be put on a plane to Guatemala on Jan. 19. Then they said he would be released the next day. Then the day passed, and nothing happened. I called the Guatemalan Consulate. They told me they had sent a lawyer to see him. That was a lie. I called another consulate. They told me he was in Louisiana. Then they said no, now he is in El Paso, Texas.

I haven’t received one call from him. Not one.

Not knowing where your family is, that is the hardest thing. Especially now, with the way they are treating us. They are not treating us like people. They are treating us worse than how people in Guatemala treat animals when they go hunting. They grab you by the throat. They throw you to the ground. They put their knees on your neck. That’s how they are treating us. Like animals.

I see on the news that people have died in detention centers in El Paso. I ask myself, as a father: What is happening to him? Where is my son really? If I have to show his photo on television, in the news, in other countries, I will do it. I will not be quiet.

I have cried bitterly. I have cried in solitude. I have gotten to my knees and prayed to God. Only God can do justice. God is big. God is good. God will help. But my body is not the same body as before. My mind is not the same anymore.

For almost two months now, I have been closed inside my home. I don’t go to work. I don’t go to the store. Every time someone knocks on the door, I ask myself, who is it? There is a lot of tension. There is a lot of fear. We need psychologists to help us with everything that is happening. This isn’t easy. And on top of that, we have to use our little resources for this.

I am an older person. I have cholesterol. I have high blood pressure. I recently suffered from pneumonia. I need medication. I always liked having extra medicine in case of emergencies, so at night I wouldn’t worry. Food is a basic necessity. Thank God, He put angels in my path. People with papers get groceries for me. My church and my pastor help me. People in the community help us get what we can’t go out to get. When you know God, God doesn’t stop providing.

I don’t have a bank account. I save my money in cash for emergencies, because you never know. Every week, you work, you get a check, and you have to decide between food, bills, and sending money to your family. You always put something away, because you never know. God told me to save for difficult times. Difficult times are here.

We got used to the freedoms here. Now there is no liberty. We are isolated. Minneapolis feels like a war zone. People tell you, if you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. What ICE is doing is terrorism. This was a beautiful country. Where did that country go? It hurts to be seen like this now.

If they detain me, I won’t fight. These people have no compassion. They see us as criminals. The president says we are criminals. But we haven’t killed anyone. We came here to work. If the day comes, I will go back to my country. But not this way. Not as a delinquent. One day we may return. But this isn’t the way.

If I could say something to ICE or to President Donald Trump, I would say this: God is the owner of all of this. Not you. God Almighty is the only owner. One day He will come. And I hope they regret everything they are doing right now. Only God is responsible for justice.

As I prepared this story on Tuesday, a local contact texted me with news: “FYI his son arrived in Guatemala today, finally after 20 days of waiting.”

The last remaining U.S.–Russia nuclear arms–control treaty, New START, expires on Feb. 5—and, with less than 48 hours to go, President Donald Trump hasn’t done anything about it.

Asked about the impending deadline in his New York Times interview last month, Trump replied, “If it expires, it expires. We’ll do a better agreement,” maybe one that brings in China—which has a growing nuclear arsenal—as a participant.

If past is precedent, a new treaty would take at least a year to negotiate; if China takes part, something that has never happened before, it would take many years.

In the meantime, we may well see the renewal of a nuclear arms race, reversing a trend of the past half-century. The stunning thing is that, by all accounts, Trump and his advisers haven’t so much as held a conversation about the possibility or its implications for U.S. policy or the safety of the world.

It’s worth recalling that when Trump scuttled the Iran nuclear deal back during his first term as president, he said that he—master of the “art of the deal”—would goad Tehran into accepting a “better” deal. This never happened. There is no reason to believe, especially given Washington’s tense relations with both Moscow and Beijing, that he’ll bring about a superior substitute for New START either.

New START—the acronym stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty—was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in February 2011, as a follow-on to previous accords, START and START II, which George H.W. Bush had signed with Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, respectively. The Obama–Medvedev treaty went further than the earlier accords, forcing each side to cut its long-range nuclear arsenals to 1,550 warheads—a 30 percent reduction from START II’s limits, a 75 percent cut from START’s. It also allowed very intrusive on-site inspections of each side’s arsenals to verify that they were in compliance.

New START was set to expire after 10 years. Obama envisioned negotiating, well before then, a follow-on accord that would make still deeper cuts, including short- and medium-range missiles. But it never happened. The U.S. had long ago dismantled almost all of those weapons, for good reason, while Russia retained about 2,000, which it wanted to keep to counter NATO’s superiority in conventional armies (just as, during much of the Cold War, the U.S. and NATO kept thousands of nukes in Western Europe to counter the Soviet Union’s conventional edge). Plus, after Putin returned as Russia’s president and started rattling sabers in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere, the political climate for arms control chilled.

So when Joe Biden came to the White House in January 2021, New START—which he had worked on as Obama’s vice president—was about to expire. The treaty did allow a one-time five-year extension, so he and Putin quickly made it so.* Diplomatic channels were still very much open (Putin wouldn’t launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine for another year); both leaders saw it in their interests to keep a cap on a possible arms race.

Now five years have passed, and here we are. Putin recently proposed a quick accord—it could be drawn up and signed in very short order—to extend New START’s ceilings on nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and warheads for another year. Trump has not replied, at least not in public.

Here’s why this is important: A major purpose of arms control is to put boundaries on the threat—to keep each side from spinning and acting upon “worst-case scenarios” of how many nukes the other side might build and, therefore, how many nukes it needs to build in response.

For instance, in the late 1950s, the intelligence branch of the U.S. Air Force estimated that the Soviet Union would have 500 intercontinental ballistic missiles by 1962, maybe by as soon as 1961. By contrast, the U.S. would have just 65 ICBMs. In other words, there would soon be a “missile gap.” As a result, the Pentagon proposed, and Congress readily approved, our own crash buildup of missiles (which would be built by the U.S. Air Force).

Then, in 1960, photos taken above the USSR, first by U-2 spy planes and then by Discoverer spy satellites, revealed a different story. Independent intelligence analysts at the CIA estimated that the Soviets would have just 50 ICBMs in the next couple of years. In reality, the Soviets turned out to have just four ICBMs. There was a missile gap, but very much in the United States’ favor.

However, by this time, the Pentagon had already embarked on its crash missile buildup. Air Force officers were still arguing they needed 2,000 ICBMs over the long haul. White House aides to President John F. Kennedy argued that the new intelligence data suggested the nation could get by with just 600. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told Kennedy that, as a political compromise, to keep the Joint Chiefs of Staff from rebelling, he needed 1,000. Kennedy, who at the time was inclined to side with his Cabinet secretaries, approved 1,000.

As a result, the Soviets, seeing this American buildup, responded with a very real buildup of their own. Had there been better information, a more bounded threat, the arms race of the missile age might have been squelched before it took off.

The parallels with current times aren’t precise. Intelligence analysts don’t have to rely so much on guesswork. Even without on-site inspection, they can learn or infer a great deal—almost everything—from high-resolution satellites, communications intercepts, and a wide range of technical and human sources. (In 2023, Putin stopped allowing on-site inspections, but the U.S. still has very high confidence that he hasn’t deployed more nuclear weapons than New START allows.)

Still, one can easily imagine even today’s officers and analysts with vested interests or hawkish inclinations arguing that, freed from the restraints of New START, the Russians could build many more missiles and warheads—and, therefore, we need to build many more to match. It’s even easier to imagine Russian officers and analysts, who tend to be more paranoid than ours, doing the same. A stepped-up arms race is likely indeed.

This action-reaction complex stems not just from a psychological need to appear equal (though that is part of what goes on). There’s a tangible element here too. The planners at U.S. Strategic Command—and probably their counterparts in Russia—maintain a “counterforce” strategy. Most of our missiles are aimed at their missiles—and, most likely, vice versa. The warheads on our missiles also have sufficient accuracy and explosive power to destroy or disable the Russian missiles in their blast-hardened silos—and, again, most likely vice versa.

By the logic of this strategy, if the Russians build more missiles, we have to build more missiles too—so that we’re still able to hit all of the targets.

This is where the new dimension of arms-race scenarios comes into focus—China. When Obama and Medvedev signed New START 15 years ago, China barely had enough nuclear weapons to warrant attention. Now they have about 600; within a few years, they’ll approach parity with the U.S. and Russia. Nobody quite knows why; Chinese officers, who used to write a fair amount about nuclear strategy, have gone silent. Whatever the motive, if China is seen as an adversary, and if counterforce is still a centerpiece of U.S. nuclear strategy, then we don’t have enough warheads to cover all of the targets.

This is why some defense analysts say it’s just as well that New START is expiring. They say that the U.S. needs more nuclear weapons than New START permits.

But this is where the discussion should begin, not end. Do we really need to be able to destroy all of the Russian and Chinese missile sites? This is a two-part question: First, what are the chances that we’ll face not just war but all-out nuclear war against Russia and China simultaneously? Second, do we need to have the ability to knock out all of their missile sites in order to deter nuclear war?

Deterring nuclear war is the aim here. If the plan is to fight, maybe win a nuclear war, how does that game go? Would we launch a first strike against Russia and China? If we did, and we aimed to destroy their missile silos, would they launch the missiles on warning, before our warheads struck—in which case, they’d inflict more damage on us than might otherwise be the case? Finally, there’s “nuclear winter“—the theory that a certain number of nuclear explosions (the calculations vary, but some are as low as a few hundred) will ignite so many fires and kick up so much dust that much of life on Earth will end. There is no winner in this war.

These are controversies that have gone on for many decades. In previous administrations, the Pentagon, StratCom, the National Security Council, and sometimes the president himself, have engaged in this discussion. They have published a Nuclear Posture Review, in classified and unclassified forms, that spelled out the policy.

Trump has not done this. It is very unlikely that he or anyone else at a high level has discussed this at all, or is even aware of the dilemmas and imponderables. Nor is there likely to be a discussion of this sort in the next few years. In the meantime, Trump and Putin should sign a one-page document extending the terms of New START. It’s an imperfect accord, but it’s better than crying “Havoc!” and letting slip the dogs of a nuclear arms race.

Correction, Feb. 3, 2026: This piece originally misstated Obama’s exit date from office.

On Sept. 15, my family and I arrived for our routine Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment at the New York City immigration courthouse. My 6-year-old daughter was wearing her school uniform and her backpack. My husband and I planned to drop her off at school afterward.

Instead, the three of us were arrested and detained.

ICE officials held us at the courthouse all day with no food before transferring us to temporary housing for the night. At around 3 the next morning, officers woke us and put us on a commercial flight. Against our will, we were flown across the country to the family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The next two months we spent there were a living nightmare.

When my family and I had fled Colombia in October 2022, we believed that the United States would be a place of refuge. Back home, we had been targeted by an armed guerrilla group—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—and over time, the death threats and physical violence became impossible to hide from. We had no choice but to flee for our lives.

On our way to the U.S., armed smugglers confined my daughter and me in a guarded safe house for days. I was forced to cook and clean for them, along with the other women. I was warned to watch my daughter closely so she would not be kidnapped. Only after being passed between multiple vehicles and handlers were we finally able to cross the border in November 2022.

After we arrived in the United States, we built a new life in Queens, New York. My daughter started school. She enjoyed art class and adored her teacher. She loved our cat. She was happy.

We applied for asylum. We were denied. But the dangers we faced in Colombia had not ended. From abroad, we learned that my husband was still receiving threats.

Because of my experience in Mexico, we then filed an application for a T visa, a form of humanitarian protection for victims of human trafficking. While that application was pending, we continued to comply with immigration authorities because we believed that following the law mattered.

That is why, even after being warned that attending our Sept. 15 check-in could lead to detention, we went anyway. But our compliance did not matter to ICE.

After we were taken to the Dilley detention center, my husband was held in a separate area from my daughter and me. Starting the first day, officers began using family separation as a threat. We were told that if we refused deportation, we would be fined $1,000 a day. We were warned that if we continued to resist deportation in any way, my husband and I could face criminal charges and our daughter could be taken from us. The officers also threatened to put us all on separate deportation flights.

The conditions at the facility only intensified the horror. People were constantly sick. Bathrooms were filthy. The food was often inedible, and the water was discolored. My daughter began losing weight because she could not eat.

Every Wednesday, deportation flights left for Colombia. Every Wednesday, we waited in fear for our names to be called. Officers unsuccessfully tried to deport us twice.

The constant threats took a toll on my health. I began experiencing regular panic attacks driven by the fear that my family would be separated or deported. I also suffer from chronic migraines, which worsened over time because the facility would not provide the medication I needed. I lived for weeks with steady pain, fainting spells, nosebleeds, and vision changes that made it difficult to function.

My daughter’s health deteriorated even faster.

At Dilley, she went from full-time school to just one hour of instruction a day. She contracted a cough, which only got worse. She cried at night and asked when we would go back to our apartment in New York. She asked about her teacher and our cat every day. My daughter was once an extroverted, healthy, and happy first grader. But at Dilley, she regressed behaviorally, wetting herself after years without accidents and begging to breastfeed again despite being 6 years old. When we sought mental health care, a psychiatrist blamed me for her distress and accused me of poor parenting.

A facility staff member accidentally struck her eye with a mop. Blood came from her eye. At the medical center, the injury was falsely recorded as a fall. Despite my daughter’s continued complaints of blurred vision, light sensitivity, and hearing problems, doctors dismissed us.

After over a month of delays, an ophthalmologist who evaluated my daughter warned that she may have suffered trauma to her eye and needed further evaluation, as well as a referral to an ENT specialist because the injury could also be affecting her hearing. My husband and I repeatedly begged the facility to provide this care, but officers insisted that it was not their responsibility—even though the injury had been caused by a staff member.

In the days before our deportation, my husband and daughter began experiencing stomach illnesses. Both suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. My husband was placed in the medical unit. He was pale and visibly unwell. For a moment, I believed that because he was so sick, ICE would not deport us.

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, ICE officers entered our room and ordered us to pack, saying we were leaving that day. My husband was taken out of the medical unit to be deported. My daughter was still coughing and vomiting. When I explained that they were too sick to travel, the agents accused me of inventing my husband’s illness, refused to let me call our lawyers, and denied my request to see a doctor. Despite my daughter’s untreated eye injury and serious cough, the officers insisted she was fine and said her health was not their responsibility.

Nearly 10 ICE agents with chains and handcuffs surrounded us and cautioned that we could leave “the easy way or the hard way.” My daughter was terrified. When she saw the chains, she screamed and cried. Officers again refused to let us contact our lawyers. There was no real choice but to comply.

They put us on a bus, along with one other woman, to transport us to Louisiana for our deportation flight. About an hour into the drive, the bus stopped, and dozens of men in chains and handcuffs got on, along with another handcuffed woman, who looked at my child and asked aloud how anyone could allow a little girl to witness this. My daughter began to cry again.

The bus ride to Louisiana was over 18 hours. We were not able to use the bathroom the entire time. At 9 a.m., while we were still on the bus, I fainted and hit my head. After I begged for medical help, the paramedic who evaluated me suggested I go to a medical center. But ICE officers refused, telling me I had no right to see a doctor.

My daughter also began to vomit on the bus that morning. For hours, despite our requests, the officers refused to give her food or water.

She received no food or water until later that afternoon, on our flight back to Colombia. I had pleaded with the officers not to put us on the plane, explaining that the pressure would worsen our health conditions, but they did not care.

My daughter vomited the entire flight. When we landed in Bogotá, she was still vomiting and coughing and was severely dehydrated. She wanted to know why we were not in New York, but I had no answers—only fear.

Today we live in hiding in Colombia. Armed groups still control our region. We cannot safely access medical care.

My daughter continues to suffer from serious vision and hearing problems but has not been able to see a specialist. Her stomach issues also have not improved, and a doctor in Colombia has diagnosed her with a severe bacterial infection. I continue to suffer from chronic migraines and anxiety, without medication. My husband and I are terrified every day that we will be murdered and our daughter will be kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

My daughter is only 6 years old. She should not know chains or handcuffs or the terror of her family being torn apart. She should never have been swept off the streets of New York or locked in a detention facility for two months. She should be in school in the United States, playing with her friends and receiving the medical care she needs.

Instead, ICE treated us like animals. Officers intimidated, restrained, and deported us without regard for our humanity. Our basic rights were violated, with no accountability or justice. My daughter is traumatized and cries every day.

We don’t know what our future will hold. But we are grateful for the time we had in America, and we will keep fighting for a better future for our daughter.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft Copilot saved civil servants 19 minutes daily on routine tasks, according to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) research comparing users to a control group of non-users.

This finding is lower than the 26-minute saving reported by participants in a Government Digital Service research study of 20,000 civil servants published in June 2025, though that research lacked a comparison group.

A separate Department for Business and Trade trial published last September found Copilot made no discernible productivity gains, speeding up some tasks while slowing others through poor-quality outputs.

The DWP research, examined how the paid licensed version of Copilot performed across eight routine tasks. It saved the most time - 26 minutes daily - when searching for existing information, followed by summarizing information, writing emails, and producing written material. It saved the least time (9 minutes daily) transcribing or summarizing meetings.

Copilot users primarily redirected time saved toward completing other tasks, improving work quality, and planning.

&quot;It allows me to focus less on the mundane stuff. I can spend time doing my actual job,&quot; said one participant quoted in the research.

Beyond time savings, users reported Copilot improved their work quality, particularly for writing emails - although more for first drafts and suggestions than anything involving human judgement. Users also reported higher job satisfaction, with some calling the service a &quot;comfort blanket&quot; that reduced stress.

The research drew on surveys of 1,716 Copilot users and 2,535 non-users, plus 19 in-depth interviews. As staff volunteered or were nominated rather than randomly selected, researchers applied statistical adjustments for demographics, job roles, and AI experience.

DWP provided 3,549 staff in central office functions - rather than public-facing work such as in Jobcentres - with licenced Copilot between October 2024 and March 2025.

In April 2025 the department made the free version of Copilot available to all its staff. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybersecurity experts usually advise victims against paying ransomware crooks, but that advice goes double for those who have been targeted by the Nitrogen group. There&#39;s no way to get your data back from them!

According to Coveware, which peered under the hood of Nitrogen&#39;s ransomware program, a programming error prevents the gang&#39;s decryptor from recovering victims&#39; files, so paying up is futile.

The finding specifically concerns the group&#39;s malware that targets VMware ESXi. Coveware said that the program encrypts files with the wrong public key, making it impossible for the criminals to decrypt them, even if the victim pays for a decryption tool.

Nitrogen&#39;s malware makes the error of loading a new variable, a QWORD, into memory so that it overlaps with the public key.

Because the malware loads the public key at offset rsp+0x20 and the 8-byte QWORD at rsp+0x1c, it overwrites the first four bytes of the public key, meaning that an attacker-supplied decryptor would fail.

&quot;Normally, when a public-private Curve25519 keypair is generated, the private key is generated first, and then the public key is derived subsequently based on the private key,&quot; Coveware said.

&quot;The resulting corrupted public key wasn&#39;t generated based on a private key, it was generated by mistakenly overwriting a few bytes of another public key. The final outcome is that no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.&quot;

Nitrogen has been around since 2023. According to Coveware, it began as one of the various offshoots that borrowed code from the leaked Conti 2 builder.

Barracuda Networks previously reported that it evolved into a ransomware group slowly over time. It first developed malware to facilitate initial access for others, although its operators didn&#39;t work as initial access brokers, but began extorting organizations in or around September 2024.

While it is not one of the most prolific groups in operation, it is also not to be underestimated.

Even with this latest finding, which will go down alongside other epic own goals by ransomware gangs, it&#39;s hard to see the funny side with this one.

The coding error takes this financially-motivated ransomware gang into the realm of pure destruction, where both parties walk away losers. ®

            <h2>UK watchdog to rule on £246M Post Office subsidy over Horizon scandal and IR35</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/post_office_horizon_subsidy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK competition regulator is set to report on a request for £246 million in subsidies to the Post Office, a publicly owned company, to cover its costs in compensation for the Horizon IT scandal and tax liability for IR35, a mechanism commonly used by tech consultants.

The Subsidy Advice Unit (SAU), part of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will report on the proposed subsidies within 30 days following a request from the Department for Business and Trade (DBT). It intends to provide the Post Office with a subsidy of £141.8 million to continue to take action in response to the Horizon IT scandal and another £104.4 million to settle a tax liability, which together represent around 28 percent of the organization&#39;s annual revenue in fiscal 2025.

In a statement, it said the Post Office has been receiving funding from the government since 2023 to enable it to cover the costs of running its Remediation Unit and Inquiry response team. The Remediation Unit is responsible for delivering redress to subpostmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal and other operational failures.

Horizon is an EPOS and back-end finance system that was first implemented by ICL, a UK tech firm majority-owned by Fujitsu in the 1990s and fully acquired in 1998. It has undergone two subsequent upgrades.

From 1999 until 2015, around 736 subpostmasters were wrongfully prosecuted and convicted over Horizon errors, devastating lives in the process. A statutory inquiry into the mass miscarriage of justice launched in 2021 and is ongoing.

Following a number of cases successfully quashing convictions, the government introduced the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 to overturn all convictions made using the Horizon system. There are four schemes to compensate victims of the scandal, one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history. The Horizon Shortfall Scheme is run by the Post Office.

The proposed subsidy is set to provide funding of up to £37.4 million in the 2026/27 financial year for the Post Office to continue to compensate victims and take part in the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry.

Separately, DBT has requested a Post Office subsidy of £104.4 million to cover tax liabilities under IR35, a tax ruling for freelancers with which government departments have struggled to comply.

IR35 was introduced to reduce off-payroll workers who avoid paying regular employment taxes, but critics argue it penalizes those who are employed on a casual basis and do not enjoy employment rights, including pensions, sick pay, and holidays. The move hit many Reg readers who work as tech contractors or use their services.

IR35 is a reform unveiled in 1999 by the UK tax authorities. An April 2021 regulation change forced medium and large businesses in the UK to set the tax status of their contractors and freelancers. Prior to this, it was set by the contractors themselves.

Contractors found to be within the scope of the legislation – i.e. inside IR35 – will have to pay more tax than they might expect.

The reforms are part of the government&#39;s crackdown on so-called disguised employment, where workers behave as employees and are able to slash their tax bills by billing for their services through personal service companies (PSCs), which are taxed at lower corporate rates.

The measures first came into effect in the UK public sector in 2017. The British government hoped the reforms would recoup £440 million ($486 million) by bringing 20,000 contractors in line.

HMRC reckons that only one in 10 contractors in the private sector who should be paying tax under the current rules are doing so correctly. It estimated the reforms would recoup £1.2 billion ($1.33 billion) a year by 2023. Both public and private sector reforms had been set to be repealed before a U-turn in December 2022. Now both are back on the books.

Seb Maley, CEO of tax advisory firm Qdos, said of the IR35 portion:

&quot;This is an astonishing amount – figures that you associate with football transfers, not necessarily IR35. It could easily be the biggest liability issued to any organization as a result of mismanaging IR35 and the off-payroll rules. It raises an important question: how have so many public sector bodies got IR35 so wrong? The legislation itself is known for its complexity, but to engage huge numbers of contractors under the wrong employment status is a sign of systematic failure. You are left to wonder if IR35 assessments were carried out. If so, how detailed were they? Was HMRC&#39;s Check Employment Status for Tax – CEST – tool used? And if that&#39;s the case, should businesses rely on it to determine IR35 status? The answer to the final question, in my opinion, is no.

&quot;While in many respects, government-owned bodies have a get-out-of-jail-free card when it comes to IR35, private sector firms don&#39;t. The sheer sums involved here are a timely reminder of exactly why complying with these rules is so important.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There is good news for administrators: Microsoft has delivered on its promise to build Sysmon functionality into Windows.

The functionality arrived in the Dev and Beta Windows Insider channels this week in builds 26300.7733 and 26220.7752, respectively. It allows administrators to capture system events via custom configuration files, filter for specific events, and write them to the standard Windows event log for pickup by third-party applications, including security tools.

Sysmon, part of the Sysinternals toolset, has long been useful for monitoring Windows&#39; internals. Mark Russinovich, Microsoft technical fellow and co-founder of Winternals, from whence Sysinternals (and Sysmon) sprang, said: &quot;It helps in detecting credential theft, uncovering stealthy lateral movement, and powering forensic investigations.

&quot;Its granular diagnostic data feeds security information and event management (SIEM) pipelines and enables defenders to spot advanced attacks.&quot;

But deployment has been painful for administrators, managing potentially thousands of endpoints across an enterprise that need to be kept. Russinovich noted &quot;a lack of official customer support for Sysmon in production environments.&quot;

Having it built in (though disabled by default) is therefore welcome, a respite from Microsoft&#39;s relentless AI integrations across its portfolio.

Enabling it requires some work with PowerShell, which shouldn&#39;t trouble Sysmon-savvy users. Microsoft notes that any existing Sysmon installation must be uninstalled first before the built-in version can be enabled.

After a month of patches that Microsoft would rather forget, Sysmon&#39;s arrival is a genuinely positive update.

Rather than adding font effects to Notepad and more AI, or turning Paint into a Photoshop knockoff, Microsoft is delivering a tool that actually makes administrators&#39; lives easier - perhaps a sign it&#39;s taking user needs more seriously than shareholder demands.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Problems with a new digital European system for certifying fishing catches are hampering producers and delaying exports, according to ministers from several EU member states.

The European Commission introduced the digital version of Catch on January 10, replacing equivalent paper systems, with the aim of tackling illegal fishing.

However, a group of countries led by Spain say the digital system has &quot;significant technical and legal shortcomings,&quot; including a lack of integration with customs control systems and countries outside the EU that use its certification scheme.

Speaking at the EU&#39;s meeting of agriculture and fisheries ministers in Brussels on January 26, Hilde Crevits, vice-minister-president of Belgium&#39;s Flemish government, said that January 10 &quot;was too early to start.&quot;

The Catch system was holding up containers at ports including Antwerp and Zeebrugge, as well as at the UK border. &quot;Fisheries products don&#39;t have a very long shelf life,&quot; she said through an official translator.

Crevits added that a related new regulation that requires captains to record the weights caught for each type of fish in a digital logbook is difficult in Belgian fishing grounds with 20 species: &quot;You just try it.&quot;

One importer told The Financial Times that it had dozens of shipping containers of fish stuck in Rotterdam in the Netherlands as the Catch system was only clearing about half of its shipments.

&quot;We keep getting inexplicable error messages, server errors,&quot; an employee of the company told the newspaper, with the system not including all fish species and postal codes for all countries covered. The system also has size limits on uploading catch certificates from non-EU countries as PDFs, which the importer said were too low.

&quot;The technical gaps and lack of interoperability with third parties risk paralysing the imports and logistics of our companies without adding any benefits,&quot; Marco Canaparo, Italy&#39;s deputy permanent representative, told the agriculture and fisheries meeting.

In response, a European Commission official said some issues had been caused by a shift from patchy national implementations of the previous paper-based versions. ®

            <h2>Universal £7,500 payout offered to PSNI staff over major data breach</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/psni_breach_compensation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) employees who had their details exposed in a significant 2023 data breach will each receive £7,500 ($10,279) as part of a universal offer of compensation.

According to Liam Kelly, chief of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, £119 million ($163 million) has been ringfenced for compensation payments, which are expected to be issued from April.

&quot;This universal offer is substantial and major progress in this protracted matter,&quot; he said. &quot;For many officers, it will mean they are able to draw a line under the case and move on with their careers.&quot;

The 2023 data breach was considered one of the most significant and potentially dangerous lapses of data security in UK history.

The PSNI accidentally published a spreadsheet online as part of a response to a request made under Freedom of Information laws.

Officers faced serious safety risks after their personal details, including names and home addresses in some cases, were exposed online in the immediate aftermath.

Given the region&#39;s history of ethno-nationalist conflict, albeit rare in recent years, affected police officers reported myriad health issues in the months that followed.

The PSNI&#39;s mental health support services were soon stretched, and many faced delays in accessing the help they needed. Many staff were also not in a position where they could pay for private care.

An unspecified number relocated for their families&#39; safety, a report confirmed. A number of officers sought support to change their names, but were told that it was an unnecessary step.

Kelly said that while the Police Federation welcomes the PSNI&#39;s universal offer – a sum it hopes will bring an end to the majority of cases staff brought to it – others who feel particularly aggrieved will want to continue with legal proceedings.

&quot;This is not a one-size-fits-all offer,&quot; he said. &quot;We will see some colleagues who were left particularly vulnerable wishing to proceed with their legal cases.

&quot;Many of our officers felt extremely vulnerable by the information that was accidentally released. The upheaval forced some to relocate or install substantial home security systems to protect themselves and their families.

&quot;This Federation welcomes the universal offer. It will deliver welcome closure for many of them but we have to recognise the fact that for some of our colleagues, the damage caused by the breach will have longer-term effects and consequences.&quot;

Edwards Solicitors, which represents around 5,000 of the 9,483 officers affected by the breach, said:

&quot;We are delighted that after more than two years of hard work and considerable patience from our clients, the Chief Constable has finally been able to make an offer of compensation.

&quot;For many officers and staff, there will be considerable relief, and they will want to accept the offer and put this very unfortunate episode behind them.

&quot;For those who have been particularly badly affected, the offer may not be suitable and their cases will continue.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Geely, Lynk & Co, and Zeekr cars we drove were all ready for US primetime.

The Geely, Lynk & Co, and Zeekr cars we drove were all ready for US primetime.

It only took a brief drive in a Zeekr 7X to convince me: Chinese cars are now competitive and could be sold in the US tomorrow. The compact battery-electric crossover, a bestseller in Europe, is aimed directly at the Tesla Model Y with its five seats, two rows, impressive road grip, energetic performance, and smooth ride. Its price in China is around $32,000 — about $7,000 cheaper than Elon Musk’s crossover.

If you’ve followed automotive news recently, you might come away thinking Chinese cars are destined for the US, with Geely among the best positioned to break through first. That’s certainly a possibility — especially after President Donald Trump seemingly threw open the doors to Chinese automakers in a recent speech. The quid pro quo: They must be built in the US. Geely recently confirmed it was “actively evaluating” a possible entry into the world’s second-largest auto market and would have a decision within three years.

Geely is best placed to build cars here: It has had an auto plant up and running in South Carolina since 2018, where it builds Volvo and Polestar vehicles. If Geely does attempt to enter the US market under its own brands, it likely won’t happen before 2029.

Still, climbing out of the Zeekr 7X, I wondered — even if it were built in the US — whether it could legally be sold here. Will restrictions on automotive software that originates in China keep it out indefinitely? Or will Geely find a way to convince the US government that its technology poses no threat to US national security?

Most US drivers won’t have heard of Geely, if they think about Chinese cars at all. Yet last year, parent company Geely Holding sold more than 4.1 million cars, making it China’s second-largest carmaker after BYD. It offers multiple brands that include Volvo, Polestar, Lotus, Malaysia’s Proton, Geely, Lynk & Co, Zeekr, and others.

During CES last month, I got a chance for brief track drives in three vehicles from three different Geely brands. The last time I’d driven a Chinese car was August 2020; that Xpeng P7 simply wasn’t ready for primetime. It was one of only two cars I’ve driven where I could overwhelm the anti-lock brakes. But Chinese automakers innovate so fast that a 2020 Xpeng might as well have been from the late 1990s.

The Geely cars I drove would likely generate strong demand here in the US — as they already do in Mexico. That’s terrifying Detroit and European automakers alike, with GM CEO Mary Barra recently sounding the alarm about Chinese EVs coming to North America. New Chinese brands might choose to target anything from the low end of the mass market to the premium and luxury sector.

First up was the Geely Starray, a compact crossover from the group’s mass-market brand, powered by a 215-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. It had a full suite of ADAS safety functions, including adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capabilities.

The Geely cars I drove would likely generate strong demand here in the US.

The contrasting black roof over silver paint suggested high-end features, and interior equipment — powered front lumbar and leg-support bolsters on the driver’s seat, heated and cooled front seats — confirmed the impression. Interior plastics were comparable to those of Korean cars a couple of generations ago. The rear doors opened only to about a 45-degree angle, which limits access for larger people, baby seats, and so forth — odd for a family car in Mexico.

On the road, the Starray was pleasant enough. It accelerated smoothly to almost highway speeds — the track layout didn’t allow for long high-speed runs — and grip and roadholding were better than expected. But it felt sluggish when driven enthusiastically, and it was hardly a rewarding driver’s car. While I wouldn’t personally buy this one, plenty of value-oriented buyers likely would — at the right price. In Mexico, the Starray’s base price is about $31,630 in US currency. Our ride-along Geely rep twice suggested it could be a $25,000 car.

I switched into a Lynk & Co 09, a midsize SUV from a brand it positions in Europe and Central America as a premium offering. Described by my Geely minder as a “hybrid,” it didn’t drive like one: Hard acceleration didn’t have that instant electric-motor thrust evident in virtually any modern hybrid. A small amount of added power arrived after a significant lag.

It turned out that the 09’s 2.0-liter, four-cylinder gas engine was paired with a Volvo mild-hybrid system that uses a 48-volt electric motor between the engine and eight-speed automatic transmission for a total output of 254hp among all four wheels. With a battery of just 0.2 kilowatt-hours, it adds incremental power to the engine, recovers some energy under regenerative braking, and restarts the engine at stops. The 48-volt system improves fuel economy, but plays a minimal role in propelling this 4,660-pound vehicle—unlike a full hybrid system operating at 300 volts that could power the car alone at low speeds.

Significantly, the 09 is built on the same SPA platform as the Volvo XC90 sold in the United States from 2016 onward. Its styling is the antithesis of the traditional, reassuring Volvo look: The headlights sit almost on top of the fenders, with three lengthwise light tubes under the glass. The bluff front end’s huge grille wraps its upper corners around the fender corners to hold the rest of the lights. The rear is more conventional SUV, with a horizontal light bar like so many others. Powered door handles give the sleek look of many EVs. In Mexico, its base price is $53,750 in US dollars. In China, on the other hand, the mild-hybrid 09 starts at $33,000.

The Zeekr 7X was my final test drive, the battery-electric crossover that clearly has the Tesla Model Y in its crosshairs. The 7X is built on the Geely SEA platform that also underpins the Volvo EX30 subcompact hatchback — though its wheelbase is a significant 4 inches longer, so its rear seat will hold adult-size humans. The 100kWh battery powers either a 416hp rear motor or a pair of motors totaling 637hp. Our test EV didn’t have the strongest regenerative braking in Sport mode, and I couldn’t test other modes in my limited time. The ride quality is considerably smoother than a Model Y, however, perhaps due to its curb weight of 5,313 pounds, fully 1,000 pounds more than the Tesla.

Given recent concerns over fully electronic door handles, it’s worth noting those of the 7X slide out from a flush position. To get them to do so, you first have to locate and push an adjacent round button. I found the seats comfortable for my particular build, though the interior was more conventional and “German,” with largely black trim — versus the new Model Y’s stripped-down, almost Scandinavian approach. More than any other vehicle on the lot, the Zeekr 7X was the one reporters and Geely execs viewed as a possible US entry. The key issue would be price. In China it sells for $32,000; the price in Mexico is roughly 97,000 pesos, or about $55,000.

Giovanni Lanfranchi, CEO of Zeekr Technology Europe, is based in Gothenburg, Sweden, where Volvo has been based for almost 100 years. Until a restructuring last year, Volvo owned 30 percent shares of both Zeekr and Lynk & Co. Major changes followed the September 2024 Taizhou Declaration from Geely founder and chairman Li Shufu. The single-page document demanded that all Geely R&D activities focus on developing every new vehicle from shared components, not just vehicle platforms but also software architectures and application layers.

More than any other vehicle on the lot, the Zeekr 7X was the one reporters and Geely execs viewed as a possible US entry.

Lanfranchi said since then, he has been “shocked” at the speed of what became “profound, radical change” in Geely’s R&D groups in Gothenburg and Frankfurt, which work side by side with their counterparts in China.

Just 16 months after the declaration, each brand already has a new vehicle on an entirely common architecture. The Geely M9, Lynk & Co 900, and Zeekr 9X shown at CES are all built on the SEA-S 900V long-range plug-in hybrid platform announced in July. They share 90 percent of their components and software, Lanfranchi said — whereas earlier Zeekr models used platforms developed by its own R&D group just for its own models.

Geely now plans to launch new vehicles in China and Europe simultaneously, rather than delaying up to a year while a Chinese-designed vehicle is adapted to conditions in other markets.

Earlier this year, Trump dropped a bombshell. He’d be entirely fine with Chinese automakers selling in the US, he told the Detroit Economic Club — as long as they open plants to build them in this country.

Geely can probably do so more easily and faster than any other Chinese maker. The plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, presently only builds Volvo and Polestar vehicles. But with common platforms and identical underlying software architectures, and Volvo and Polestar migrating onto them, Lanfranchi sees “no reason not to” build group vehicles in the Volvo factory. He stressed that such a move was not his to make, and no decision had been announced. But in the end, he mused, “I think it may happen.”

Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and an expert on China’s auto industry, called Geely’s US entry “absolutely possible, likely, and probable.” The company has long felt, he said, that the US would be “its destiny.”

Dunne noted that Chinese EVs in the UK, led by BYD and MG, are roughly 15 percent cheaper than Japanese and Korean models. “The Chinese don’t have to be scary cheap,” he said. “They just need to be priced low enough to make you pause — then take a closer look.”

That’s exactly how German, Japanese, and then Korean makers built their businesses, along with features domestic cars didn’t offer, from smaller cars to bulletproof reliability to long warranties. Those countries, of course, are allies of the US — China is not.

Lyric translations and previews are coming to all users, but offline lyrics will be a premium feature.

On Wednesday, Spotify announced a few new lyrics features aiming to make it easier to understand and access song lyrics, including translations, previews, and offline lyrics.

Lyric translations were originally introduced in 2022, but have only been available in specific markets so far. Now, they’re rolling out worldwide to both free and premium Spotify users, who will soon start seeing a translation icon in the lyrics section on the app. When you tap this, “translations will appear based on your device’s language,” if a translation is available.

Spotify is also rolling out lyric previews worldwide for free and premium users. This feature adds a condensed lyrics box between the song title and the album art, so you can see a song’s lyrics without switching to the full-screen lyrics view.

Lastly, Spotify Premium users worldwide are getting access to offline lyrics. When you download tracks on Spotify, the lyrics will now also be saved.

Amazon’s revamped AI-powered assistant is now available to everyone in the US, with new tiers that include a free option for non-Prime users.

Amazon has announced that its generative AI-powered digital assistant Alexa Plus is now available to all Prime members in the US via any Alexa-enabled device, Alexa.com, and the Alexa mobile app. If you don’t have Prime, you can access the assistant on a new free tier on the web and app, or pay $20 a month for unlimited access to Alexa Plus, without Prime.

Alexa Plus initially launched in March 2025 in an Early Access program and, over the last year, has slowly expanded to tens of millions of users, Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, told The Verge in an interview.

Now, the smarter, more conversational assistant is moving out of Early Access and is officially available to anyone in the US. Early Access recently launched in Canada and Mexico, and according to Rausch, a closed Beta program is being trialed in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, with Early Access expected to follow.

In the US, the new tiers for using Alexa Plus are as follows:

If you have Prime and use any Echo devices, Alexa Plus will arrive shortly (or may already be there) via a software upgrade. You can also say “Alexa, upgrade to Alexa Plus” or log in to your Amazon account at Alexa.com. Rausch says you can choose to opt out of the upgrade. And if you decide you want to revert to the old Alexa after upgrading, that is still an option.

If you don’t have Prime but want to try Alexa Plus, you can go to Amazon.com/AlexaPlus.

Based on an entirely new architecture and powered by large language models from Amazon Nova and Anthropic, Alexa Plus is a ground-up rebuild of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. It has moved from being a basic command-and-control voice assistant to a “foundational AI assistant” that can understand and respond to natural language.

Now, in addition to setting timers, playing music, and controlling smart home gadgets, the voice assistant can answer more complex queries, respond to more in-depth requests, and make it easier to control your smart home by creating routines with your voice.

It can also manage your family’s calendars and meal plans, provide step-by-step recipe directions, make restaurant reservations, book an Uber or a home repair person, or buy concert tickets.

You can also use Alexa Plus as a text-based chatbot via Alexa.com on the web, where it’s designed for deeper research, planning, and generating content.

Since its launch, Rausch says people have been using the Alexa Plus voice assistant twice as much. “We continue to see week-over-week customer engagement with Alexa Plus going up.”

The chatbot version of Alexa Plus is newer; the web interface launched last month, and the Alexa app was recently redesigned to put the chatbot front and center. “A lot of customers aren’t sure about subscribing to an additional AI chatbot experience for an additional $20 a month,” says Rausch. “I’m excited that Prime customers just have unlimited access to a world-class foundational AI assistant as part of their Prime benefits.”

            <div id="article-text">Fed up with increasing subscription prices, viewers embrace rogue streaming boxes.

Walk the rows of the farmers market in a small, nondescript Texas town about an hour away from Austin, and you might stumble across something unexpected: In between booths selling fresh, local pickles and pies, there’s a table piled high with generic-looking streaming boxes, promising free access to NFL games, UFC fights, and any cable TV network you can think of.

It’s called the SuperBox, and it’s being demoed by Jason, who also has homemade banana bread, okra, and canned goods for sale. “People are sick and tired of giving Dish Network $200 a month for trash service,” Jason says. His pitch to rural would-be cord-cutters: Buy a SuperBox for $300 to $400 instead, and you’ll never have to shell out money for cable or streaming subscriptions again.

I met Jason through one of the many Facebook groups used as support forums for rogue streaming devices like the SuperBox. To allow him and other users and sellers of these devices to speak freely, we’re only identifying them by their first names or pseudonyms.

“People are sick and tired of giving Dish Network $200 a month for trash service.”

SuperBox and its main competitor, vSeeBox, are gaining in popularity as consumers get fed up with what TV has become: Pay TV bundles are incredibly expensive, streaming services are costlier every year, and you need to sign up for multiple services just to catch your favorite sports team every time they play. The hardware itself is generic and legal, but you won’t find these devices at mainstream stores like Walmart and Best Buy because everyone knows the point is accessing illegal streaming services that offer every single channel, show, and movie you can think of. But there are hundreds of resellers like Jason all across the United States who aren’t bothered by the legal technicalities of these devices. They’re all part of a massive, informal economy that connects hard-to-pin-down Chinese device makers and rogue streaming service operators with American consumers looking to take cord-cutting to the next level.

This economy paints a full picture of America, and characters abound. There’s a retired former cop in upstate New York selling the vSeeBox at the fall festival of his local church. A Christian conservative from Utah who pitches rogue streaming boxes as a way of “defunding the swamp and refunding the kingdom.” An Idaho-based smart home vendor sells vSeeBoxes alongside security cameras and automated window shades. Midwestern church ladies in Illinois and Indian uncles in New Jersey all know someone who can hook you up: real estate agents, MMA fighters, wedding DJs, and special ed teachers among the sellers who all form what amounts to a modern-day bootlegging scheme, car trunks full of streaming boxes just waiting for your call.

These folks are a permanent thorn in the side of cable companies and streaming services, who have been filing lawsuits against resellers of these devices for years, only to see others take their place practically overnight.

Jason, for his part, doesn’t beat around the bush about where he stands in this conflict. “I hope it puts DirecTV and Dish out of business,” he tells me.

Jason isn’t alone in his disdain for big TV providers. “My DirecTV bill was just too high,” says

Eva, a social worker and grandmother from California. Eva bought her first vSeeBox two years ago when she realized she was paying nearly $300 a month for TV, including premium channels. Now, she’s watching those channels for free, saving thousands of dollars. “It turned out to be a no-brainer,” Eva says.

Natalie, a California-based software consultant, paid about $120 a month for cable. Then, TV transitioned to streaming, and everything became a subscription. All those subscriptions add up — especially if you’re a sports fan. “You need 30 subscriptions just to watch every game,” she complains. “It’s gotten out of control. It’s not sustainable,” she says.

Natalie bought her first SuperBox five years ago. At the time, she was occasionally splurging on pay-per-view fights, which would cost her anywhere from $70 to $100 a pop. SuperBox’s $200 price tag seemed like a steal. “You’re getting the deal of the century,” she says.

“I’ve been on a crusade to try to convert everyone.”

James, a gas station repairman from Alabama, estimates that he used to pay around $125 for streaming subscriptions every month. “The general public is being nickeled and dimed into the poor house,” he says.

James says that he was hesitant about forking over a lot of money upfront for a device that could turn out to be a scam. “I was nervous, but I figured: If it lasts four months, it pays for itself,” he tells me. James has occasionally encountered some glitches with his vSeeBox, but not enough to make him regret his purchase. “I’m actually in the process of canceling all the streaming services,” he says.

It’s stories like these, spread among friends, neighbors, and Facebook acquaintances, that have helped devices like SuperBox and vSeeBox gain a foothold across America. Natalie got her first SuperBox from a friend, and has since bought two or three more for family members. James got introduced to these devices through a friend as well, as did Eva. And while James quickly became a professional seller, Eva has simply been spreading the word — and buying additional boxes for her extended family — out of conviction.

“I’ve been on a crusade to try to convert everyone,” she says.

For years, tech-savvy TV fans have found ways to watch live sports events and other TV programs in shady ways, either by paying for bootleg streaming services or watching free on sketchy websites plastered with porn ads. The most dedicated pirates use media center apps like Kodi with rogue add-ons on their PCs or Mac Minis, but piracy has gotten more and more accessible over time. The Play Store on Android TVs is full of browsers optimized for those shady streaming sites. Amazon won’t ever admit it, but the popularity of Fire TV Sticks is in part due to how easy it is to root them and sideload piracy apps.

SuperBox and vSeeBox have simply turned all of this into easy-to-sell products, with a thin layer of legal deniability. vSeeBox guides users to a pirate streaming service called “Heat”; SuperBox’s service is “Blue TV.” You won’t find apps for either service on Google Play or any other app store; users who have tried report that it’s impossible to run them on any other third-party device, suggesting that they were custom-built by or on behalf of the makers of SuperBox and vSeeBox.

The boxes don’t ship with the apps preinstalled — but they make it really easy to do so. vSeeBox, for instance, ships with an Android TV launcher that has a row of recommended apps, displaying download links to install apps for the Heat streaming service with one click. New SuperBox owners won’t have trouble accessing the apps, either. “Once you open your packaging, there are instructions,” Jason says. “Follow them to a T.”

Once downloaded, these apps mimic the look and feel of traditional TV and streaming services. vSeeBox’s Heat, for instance, has a dedicated “Heat Live” app that resembles Sling TV, Fubo, or any other live TV subscription service, complete with a program guide and the ability to flip through channels with your remote control. SuperBox’s Blue TV app does the same thing, while a separate “Blue Playback” app even offers some time-shifting functionality, similar to Hulu’s live TV service. Natalie estimates that she can access between 6,000 and 8,000 channels on her SuperBox, including premium sports networks and movie channels, and hundreds of local Fox, ABC, and CBS affiliates from across the United States.

Most vSeeBox and SuperBox users don’t seem to care where exactly the content is coming from, as long as they can access the titles they’re looking for.

How exactly these apps are able to offer all those channels is one of the streaming boxes’ many mysteries. “All the SuperBox channels are streaming out of China,” Jason suggests, in what seems like a bit of folk wisdom. In a 2025 lawsuit against a SuperBox reseller, Dish Network alleged that at least some of the live TV channels available on the device are being ripped directly from Dish’s own Sling TV service. “An MLB channel transmitted on the service [showed] Sling’s distinguishing logo in the bottom right corner,” the lawsuit claims. The operators of those live TV services use dedicated software to crack Sling’s DRM, and then retransmit the unprotected video feeds on their services, according to the lawsuit.

Heat and Blue TV also each have dedicated apps for Netflix-style on-demand viewing, and the services often aren’t shy about the source of their programming. Heat’s “VOD Ultra” app helpfully lists movies and TV shows categorized by provider, including HBO Max, Disney Plus, Starz, and Hulu. Some of this content may be ripped directly from legitimate services, similar to the way rogue service operators gain access to live TV feeds. Another possibility was highlighted in a 2019 indictment of pirate streaming service operators: To offer their paying customers a Netflix-like experience even for movies that were still in theaters, the defendants allegedly went old-school and downloaded videos from newsgroups and torrent sites with the help of automated scripts.

Most vSeeBox and SuperBox users don’t seem to care where exactly the content is coming from, as long as they can access the titles they’re looking for.

“I haven’t found anything missing yet,” James says. “I’ve actually been able to watch shows from streaming services I didn’t have before.”

The companies behind SuperBox and vSeeBox launched in 2019 and 2020, respectively, which was perfect timing: With everyone cooped up inside during the covid-19 pandemic, streaming boomed, and people like Natalie burned through the massive libraries of their boxes in no time. “We watched it all,” she jokes.

However, rogue streaming boxes have been around for much longer than either company. A handful of Chinese manufacturers first began churning out these devices over a decade ago with a much narrower audience in mind: Devices like TVPad, Moon Box, and CrownTV all specifically targeted Asian expats by providing free access to TV networks from their home countries for a one-time $200-to-$300 purchase price.

TVPad boasted on its now-defunct website that consumers would have access to “over 100+ popular Chinese channels, more than 40 Korean channels, 20+ Japanese channels,” and more. It was a huge hit among expats: The company behind TVPad is said to have sold 3 million units worldwide, according to a legal filing.

TVPad sold the device through its own website, but also started to use a network of local resellers. TVPads would pop up in malls and mom-and-pop stores in Asian neighborhoods across the United States, where they were openly sold next to snacks and groceries. In the spring of 2014, a Los Angeles-based reseller even rented a billboard atop a medical plaza in the city’s Koreatown neighborhood, advertising the device as capable of playing South Korean TV networks without monthly fees.

It didn’t take long for overseas rights holders to take notice. China’s state broadcaster CCTV teamed up with Dish to sue the maker of TVPad in 2015, eventually putting the company behind it out of business.

Others quickly filled the void, and the makers of these devices increasingly embraced an interesting design choice: While the original TVPad looked more or less like an Apple TV clone, manufacturers started to add front-facing LED displays with clocks and channel numbers — the kinds of things you’d expect to see on a satellite TV receiver.

That’s no accident, according to researchers from Australia’s RMIT University, who wrote in a 2019 paper about TVPad and similar devices that their “design and user experience evoke longer histories of diasporic satellite television.” Expat communities had long tapped into programming from their home countries one way or another, be it through official satellite subscription services or black-market receivers capable of descrambling those stations for free. Going down the pirate route seemed a lot less risky when the rights holders were half a world away.

Chinese device makers learned their lessons from that first wave of expat streaming boxes: They realized that the market for rogue streamers was much bigger than just the diaspora, and they stopped openly talking about piracy, leaving the riskier parts of their business to their American resellers. Some also kept the clock, with SuperBox still looking more like a satellite TV receiver than an Apple TV.

Holdover digital clocks aside, SuperBox and vSeeBox aren’t shy about hyping their products. The companies sell Android-based streaming devices with a variety of different specs and price points, and both take creative freedom with their marketing. The vSeeBox V6 Plus is being advertised as an 8K HDR Android TV box; its chipset does not actually support 8K playback. SuperBox’s latest S7 Max device promises 6K video — a resolution used almost exclusively for professional video production. There are no 6K TVs available for sale to consumers, as SuperBox’s own website points out.

All of this doesn’t exactly instill confidence in the security of these devices. “You don’t know if there is any kind of malware built into the box,” says Mike, an IT worker from Pennsylvania who uses a vSeeBox.. It’s a reasonable concern: In the past, cybercriminals have exploited insecure streaming boxes to commit ad fraud and other crimes. In a recent lawsuit, Google estimated that one such botnet consisted of 10 million streaming boxes and other personal devices, though the lawsuit did not mention vSeeBox or SuperBox as affected.

A recent report also suggested that SuperBox devices were connecting to Grass, a residential proxy network that lets end users monetize unused internet bandwidth. Grass founder Andrej Radonjic tells me that there’s no connection between the device and his service. “SuperBox is not a user, customer, or affiliate of Grass, and Grass does not permit third-party installations of its software in consumer devices,” Radonjic says. “Grass has not encountered its software being used by any specific smart TV box or streaming device.”

With hard-to-pin-down companies operating from overseas through an army of small-time resellers, these devices arguably represent much higher security risks than anything made by Apple or Google. Mike admits that he has concerns, but they haven’t stopped him from using his box.

If you try to buy a SuperBox or vSeeBox by searching for them online, you’ll find countless websites, all looking like official company stores, but run by individual resellers. The same is true for the seller-run subreddits and Facebook groups that double as customer support. Getting honest feedback from them can be challenging.

Jason had his doubts before he became a streaming box reseller. Sending an unknown company in China a few thousand dollars for a wholesale order of streaming devices seemed risky. “I was so skeptical [of] ordering from SuperBox,” he admits. What ultimately convinced him were weeks of back-and-forth with a gentleman from Hong Kong, who walked him through the sales process and told him that the company has fewer than 500 resellers in the United States.

SuperBox and vSeeBox rely on such direct relationships to recruit resellers, with company representatives often using personal Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram accounts for outreach. In many cases, these accounts feature likenesses of young, attractive women, with profile pictures ripped from fashion websites and Instagram model profiles.

After signing him up as a reseller, Jason’s SuperBox contact also recruited him for a unique side gig: Whenever Jason finds a SuperBox advertised for less than the company’s suggested retail price, he buys it and sells it back to the company for a premium. He says that the SuperBox maker then checks the device’s MAC address against a list of past sales and remotely deactivates all boxes it sold to the reseller who openly advertised the unauthorized discount.

Offending sellers are then asked to pay a fine, Jason says. Consumers who happened to buy a box for the wrong price find it locked, with an onscreen warning telling them to contact their service provider. vSeeBox engages in similar practices, Mike says: “They can essentially shut off the boxes.”

To alleviate the concerns of would-be buyers fearful of getting scammed, device makers maintain online verification tools. Each reseller gets a certificate with a unique code. Enter that code into a web form, and the company will tell you if the reseller in question is in good standing.

As a result, many resellers have stopped advertising device prices online altogether, only adding to the mysteries of rogue streaming boxes. Neither company responded to multiple interview requests for this story, and both are obtuse about their owners and executive leadership.

Resellers and users are more than willing to fill those gaps with wild rumors. One Facebook post claims that SuperBox was developed by a Comcast engineer who wasn’t willing to share the fruits of his labor with his employer. “They tried to buy this person’s product and silence,” the post ominously states. AT&T supposedly also tried to buy the device, but “SuperBox said no.”

Jason had heard a different story from a friend. SuperBox was engineered by a group of veterans from California, he tells me, and “Spectrum Internet” secretly owns 20 percent of their company. I wasn’t able to confirm the claim about the veterans. Spectrum Internet, however, is not a company, but the brand name for internet and pay TV services sold by telco giant Charter — a company that generated more than $55 billion with its cable TV and broadband business in 2024, and seemingly would have very little to gain from dabbling in pirate streaming hardware on the side. Charter declined to comment.

It’s clear to pretty much everyone that SuperBox and vSeeBox don’t have the licensing agreements required to stream thousands of TV channels, live sports events, and on-demand movies. “Obviously, it is definitely piracy,” Mike says.

“I’m sure it’s not super legal,” Natalie says. However, with these kinds of devices regularly popping up on major e-commerce sites, she didn’t bother researching the legal intricacies. “I don’t care,” she says.

Resellers have been sued, and are often made to pay hefty fines. Dish Network sued a California-based SuperBox seller last summer, alleging copyright infringement. The case is ongoing. Dish also won a case against a vSeeBox reseller in 2024, forcing defendants to cough up $1.25 million in damages for the sale of 500 rogue streaming devices. A year ago, another vSeeBox seller was ordered to pay $405,000 in damages for the sale of 162 devices.

But none of that feels relevant to the people using these services. “As far as I’m aware, watching streaming is not illegal,” James tells me. “Hosting it is.”

“Why would I pay for something I get for free?”

This also seems like a bit of load-bearing folk wisdom: Copyright owners have very famously sued people for accessing copyrighted content in the past, and there’s nothing stopping them from trying again if they want to. Even mentioning this idea to copyright law professors provokes thoughtful responses about legal tactics and business strategy considerations. “Copyright holders are likely to look for chokepoints where they can maximize the impact of legal pressure, but where those are is not always predictable,” says Blake Reid, an internet and copyright law professor at Colorado Law School. “Historically we’ve seen actions up and down the Internet stack, against device manufacturers, service providers, and even users. The legal actions copyright holders take are not always obvious or intuitive and often contradict social norms and folk wisdom in online communities.”

Jack Lerner, a law professor who heads UC Irvine’s Intellectual Property, Arts, and Technology Clinic, says that going after individual users would be challenging. “It’s not entirely clear that consumers would be committing copyright infringement just by accessing pirated content through these boxes,” Lerner says. “In the analog world, merely consuming pirated material is not illegal. For example, it’s not against the law to read a book that was copied by someone else and given to you.”

But there are other, perhaps worse punishments Hollywood could mete out to streaming pirates. “Rightsholders regularly pressure ISPs to cut off infringing content and terminate subscriber accounts,” Lerner says. “If they haven’t already done so, it would not surprise me if ISPs were to start terminating the accounts of people who use these devices.”

The challenging intellectual complexity of the situation can’t compete with the combination of convenience and defiance that runs through this community. “Illegal or not: [If] it plays, I’m watching it,” James says. “What are they gonna do? Come and arrest me?”

As Netflix and other services continue to increase their prices, some streaming box users are done with paying for TV once and for all. If SuperBox or vSeeBox got sued out of existence, they would likely just move on to the next device. For people like Jason, there’s little pay TV or streaming service operators can do to win him back. “They can try, but good luck,” he tells me.

James agrees. “Why would I pay for something I get for free?”

The throughline in all of my conversations with SuperBox and vSeeBox users was that TV has gotten both too complicated and too expensive. But quite a few of them continue to pay for some services.

Natalie, for instance, has a Peacock subscription. “It’s super cheap,” she tells me. She also cycles in and out of Hulu’s live TV service, which she appreciates for its cloud DVR. Eva doesn’t think she’ll ever go back to paying almost $300 a month for pay TV, but estimates that she pays around $60 to $70 a month for services like Netflix and Disney Plus. “That’s still reasonable to me,” she says.

And Mike is still paying for YouTube TV after realizing that his vSeeBox couldn’t fully replace it. “The paid services are worth it, to a certain extent, for me,” he says.

However, even people like Mike only have so much patience for being pawns in the streaming wars. When ABC and other Disney-owned channels went dark on YouTube TV last fall, he seriously considered pulling the plug and moving all his viewing to his rogue streaming box. Many more people could find themselves tempted to do the same, especially if streaming services keep raising their prices and media companies continue to make consumers suffer during licensing fee fights.

“This box is not that hard to figure out,” Mike tells me. “Anybody can do it.”</div>

It also pokes fun at OpenAI’s advertising plans in a new Super Bowl ad.

Anthropic has announced that it won’t be bringing ads to its AI chatbot Claude, in sharp contrast to confirmed plans from OpenAI to allow advertising in ChatGPT. To hammer the point home further, the company is releasing a Super Bowl commercial that makes fun of unnamed rivals adding adverts to their AI.

“We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests,” the company says in a new blog post. “So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see ‘sponsored’ links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.”

The announcement goes on to highlight exactly why including ads “would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be.” It suggests the profit incentive could interfere with providing the most helpful advice to a user asking about health problems like sleeping issues, and that ads might prove a distraction for anyone using Claude to work.

That said, Anthropic does make sure to leave the door open for a reversal: “Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.”

An about-face a few years down the line might look hypocritical in the light of the new Super Bowl ad the company is releasing to highlight its announcement. It’s one of four commercials released so far on YouTube along the same theme, with humanized AIs dropping adverts in the middle of their advice. The Wall Street Journal reports that a shorter 30-second version of this spot will air during the game on Sunday, with a separate minute-long commercial featuring an ad-enabled AI therapist during the pregame show.

None of the ads call out ChatGPT by name, but their target is obvious. OpenAI announced last month that ads are coming to ChatGPT soon for free users or those on the cheaper Go tier, though they’re supposed to be “clearly labeled” and sit apart from the chatbot’s answers to queries.

Warren is asking Google for more details about the kinds of data it will send to retail partners — and how much.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is pressing Google for more information about its plans to build a checkout feature into its Gemini AI chatbot. In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Warren expresses concerns that the integration could allow Google and retailers “to exploit sensitive user data” or “manipulate consumers into spending more and paying higher prices.”

Last month, Google announced that it will soon allow users to buy products directly within Gemini through the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a standard it developed in partnership with Shopify, Target, Walmart, Wayfair, and Etsy. The UCP is supposed to make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers, but Warren wants to know just how much user information — and what kinds — Google plans on providing to retailers through this pipeline.

“Google already possesses unprecedented troves of user search and AI chat data, and such intimate data could be merged with both user data from other Google services and third-party retailer data to drive consumer behavior in an exploitative manner,” Warren writes, while also questioning whether Google will prioritize shopping results from retail partners over competitors.

Warren adds that the company has already admitted that it will use “sensitive data to help retailers upsell consumers into buying a more ‘premium’ product.” The letter cites a reply from Google on X in which it clarified that retailers will be able to “show additional premium product options that people might be interested in.”

In addition to a series of questions about user privacy, Warren is asking Google for information about how user data will affect pricing, as well as whether it will inform users when Gemini suggests a product “based on upselling objectives, advertising incentives, or sensitive user data.” Google has until February 17th to respond.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

Why AI companies are betting on next-gen nuclear

AI is driving unprecedented investment for massive data centers and an energy supply that can support its huge computational appetite. One potential source of electricity for these facilities is next-generation nuclear power plants, which could be cheaper to construct and safer to operate than their predecessors.We recently held a subscriber-exclusive Roundtables discussion on hyperscale AI data centers and next-gen nuclear—two featured technologies on the MIT Technology Review 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026 list.

How social media encourages the worst of AI boosterism

Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics.Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.—Will Douglas Heaven

The paints, coatings, and chemicals making the world a cooler place

It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids.But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required. Read the full story.

A brain implant changed her life. Then it was removed against her will.Sticking an electrode inside a person’s brain can do more than treat a disease. Take the case of Rita Leggett, an Australian woman whose experimental brain implant designed to help people with epilepsy changed her sense of agency and self.Leggett told researchers that she “became one” with her device. It helped her to control the unpredictable, violent seizures she routinely experienced, and allowed her to take charge of her own life. So she was devastated when, two years later, she was told she had to remove the implant because the company that made it had gone bust.The removal of this implant, and others like it, might represent a breach of human rights, ethicists say in a paper published earlier this month. And the issue will only become more pressing as the brain implant market grows in the coming years and more people receive devices like Leggett’s. Read the full story.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Here’s how biotechnology could help.—Matt Blois

            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.
