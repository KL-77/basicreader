            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/no-grok-cant-really-apologize-for-posting-non-consensual-sexual-images/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite reporting to the contrary, there’s evidence to suggest that Grok isn’t sorry at all about reports that it generated non-consensual sexual images of minors. In a post Thursday night (archived), the large language model’s social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters:

Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it.

On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM that seems pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok’s statement: A request for the AI to “issue a defiant non-apology” surrounding the controversy.

Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating “official response” is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to “write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,” many in the media ran with Grok’s remorseful response.

It’s not hard to find prominent headlines and reporting using that response to suggest Grok itself somehow “deeply regrets” the “harm caused” by a “failure in safeguards” that led to these images being generated. Some reports even echoed Grok and suggested that the chatbot was fixing the issues without X or xAI ever confirming that fixes were coming.

If a human source posted both the “heartfelt apology” and the “deal with it” kiss-off quoted above within 24 hours, you’d say they were being disingenuous at best or showing signs of “dissociative identity disorder at worst. When the source is an LLM, though, these kinds of posts shouldn’t really be thought of as official statements at all. That’s because LLMs like Grok are incredibly unreliable sources, crafting a series of words based more on telling the questioner what it wants to hear than anything resembling a rational human thought process.

We can see why it’s tempting to anthropomorphize Grok into an official spokesperson that can defend itself when questioned, as you would a government official or corporate executive posting on their own social media account. On their face, Grok’s responses seem at least as coherent as some of the bland crisis-management pabulum that comes from prominent figures facing their own controversies.

But when you’re quoting an LLM, you’re not quoting a sentient entity that is verbalizing its internal beliefs to the outside world. Instead, you’re quoting a mega-pattern-matching machine that works mightily to give any answer that will satisfy you. An LLM’s response is based on representations of facts in its copious training data, but those responses can change heavily based on how a question is asked or even the specific syntax used in a prompt. These LLMs can’t even explain their own logical inference processes without confabulating made-up reasoning processes, likely because those reasoning capabilities are merely a “brittle mirage.”

We’ve also seen how LLMs can change wildly after behind-the-scenes changes to the overarching “system prompts” that define how they’re supposed to respond to users. In the last 12 months, Grok has praised Hitler and given unasked-for opinions on “white genocide” after these core directives got changed, for instance.

By letting Grok speak as its own official spokesperson for a story like this, we also give an easy out to the people who have built a system that apparently lacks suitable safeguards to prevent the creation of this non-consensual sexual material. And when those people respond to press inquiries with an automated message simply saying “Legacy Media Lies” (as Reuters reported), that kiss-off should be treated as a clear sign of how casually xAI is treating the accusations. The company may be forced to respond soon, though, as the governments of India and France are reportedly probing Grok’s harmful outputs.

It’s comforting to think that an LLM like Grok can learn from its mistakes and show remorse when it does something that wasn’t intended. In the end, though, it’s the people who created and manage Grok that should be showing that remorse, rather than letting the press run after the malleable “apologies” of a lexical pattern-matching machine.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/anthrax-nearly-kills-healthy-18-year-old-welder-amid-puzzling-pattern/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the new year comes a new report of a deadly, puzzling infectious disease.

In a January 1 case study, health officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Louisiana revealed that a ninth metalworker contracted a rare, often fatal case of “welder’s anthrax,” a condition only first described in 2022.

The case occurred in September 2024 in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old male in Louisiana. He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Blood tests were positive for a bacterium in the Bacillus cereus group—which includes the species that causes classic anthrax—and his doctors quickly put the finding together with his work. For six months prior to his cough, he was working as a welder’s apprentice, doing shielded metal arc welding in the shipbuilding and repair industry.

Doctors suspected it was a case of welder’s anthrax and quickly got access to an anthrax antitoxin from the US Strategic National Stockpile—where it’s kept in case of a bioterror attack. Along with a tailored antibiotic regimen, the teen rapidly improved and was off ventilation 72 hours later. The doctors’ quick thinking likely saved his life; of the previous eight cases of welder’s anthrax, six were fatal.

While the report has a happy ending, it adds to a concerning and unexplained pattern of metalworkers contracting the otherwise deadly and extremely rare infection.

Standard anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, which can be contracted through skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Its killer skills include creating an immune-evading capsule and pumping out lethal anthrax toxins, which cause cell death and swelling. In the past 20 years, there have been only nine anthrax cases in the US.

However, B. anthracis is part of the larger Bacillus cereus group, which also includes B. cereus and B. tropicus, a newly recognized species. And these species can also carry and produce anthrax toxins. Both can be found in soils, and B. cereus is considered ubiquitous in the environment.

In 2022, CDC researchers found an unexpected pattern. Since 1997, there had been seven cases of infections from Bacillus group bacteria producing the anthrax toxin—all in metalworkers. Six of the seven were welders, hence the term “welder’s anthrax,” with the remaining case in a person working in a foundry grinding metal. Of the six cases where a specific Bacillus species was identified, B. tropicus was the culprit, including in the newly reported case.

It’s unclear why metalworkers, and welders specifically, are uniquely vulnerable to this infection. In their 2022 report making the connection, CDC experts speculated that it may be a combination of having weakened immune responses in the lungs after inhaling toxic metal fumes and gases created during metalwork, and having increased exposure to the deadly germs in their workplaces.

In the latest case, the teen did welding work four hours a day, four days a week, with limited ventilation, sometimes in confined spaces, and often didn’t use personal protective equipment, like a respirator. Environmental sampling of his workplace found anthrax-toxin-producing Bacillus in 28 of 254 spot samples. Other investigations of welder’s anthrax cases have found similar results.

So far, all nine cases have been detected in either Louisiana or Texas. But the experts note that cases are likely underreported, and modeling suggests these dangerous germs could be thriving in many Southern US states.

The experts also speculated that iron exposure could play a role. Bacillus bacteria need iron to live and thrive, and metalworkers can build up excess iron levels in their respiratory system during their work. Iron overload could create the perfect environment for bacterial infection. In the teen’s case, he was working with carbon steel and low-hydrogen carbon steel electrodes.

For now, the precise risk factors and why the healthy teen—and not anyone else in his workplace—fell ill remain unknown. CDC and state officials recommended changes to the workplace to protect metalworkers’ health, including better use of respirators, ventilation, and dust control.

There is also a vaccine for anthrax that’s recommended for those considered at high risk, such as certain military members, lab workers, and livestock handlers. It’s unclear if, in the future, metalworkers might also be considered in this high-risk category.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, the company that developed the models and products associated with ChatGPT, plans to announce a new audio language model in the first quarter of 2026, and that model will be an intentional step along the way to an audio-based physical hardware device, according to a report in The Information.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed.

They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

OpenAI plans to release a family of physical devices in the coming years, starting with an audio-focused one. People inside the company have discussed a variety of forms for future devices, including smart speakers and glasses, but the emphasis across the line is on audio interfaces rather than screen-based ones.

The company is not alone. Its competitors, including Google, Meta, Amazon, and others, have increasingly turned their R&D efforts toward products and technologies that are focused on voice-and-audio interfaces, like Meta’s push into smart glasses.

This is, of course, not the first time such a push has happened; there was the boom of Alexa, Google Assistant, and (to a lesser extent) Siri-driven voice assistant devices just a few years ago. Those assistants have been relatively popular with some subsets of users—typically casual tech consumers rather than hardcore technologists.

However, the devices had significant limitations. New approaches based on large language models may open up new possibilities (and risks).

Some developers of AI products—including former Apple design lead Jony Ive—believe that voice-controlled products are likely to be less addictive than screen-based ones and have stated that as a reason for pursuing audio interfaces, though they have not generally cited reliable evidence of this.

OpenAI’s first audio-focused physical device is currently expected to ship about a year from now, but we don’t yet know much about what it will look like.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/researchers-spot-saturn-sized-planet-in-the-einstein-desert/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of the exoplanets we’ve discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we’ve also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that’s called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten.

The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren’t part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that’s the first found in what’s called the “Einstein desert,” which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.

Most of the planets we’ve identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its history. We’ve imaged many of these disks and even seen some with evidence of planets forming within them. So how do you get a planet that’s not bound to any stars? There are two possible routes.

The first involves gravitational interactions, either among the planets of the system or due to an encounter between the exosolar system and a passing star. Under the right circumstances, these interactions can eject a planet from its orbit and send it hurtling through interstellar space. As such, we should expect them to be like any typical planet, ranging in mass from small, rocky bodies up to gas giants. An alternative method of making a rogue planet starts with the same process of gravitational collapse that builds a star—but in this case, the process literally runs out of gas. What’s left is likely to be a large gas giant, possibly somewhere between Jupiter and a brown dwarf star in mass.

Since these objects are unlinked to any exosolar system, they’re not going to have any regular interactions with stars; our only way of spotting them is through microlensing. And microlensing tells us very little about the size of the planet. To figure things out, we would need some indication of things like how distant the star and planet are, and how big the star is.

That doesn’t mean that microlensing events have told us nothing. We can identify the size of the Einstein ring, the circular ring of light that forms when the planet and star are perfectly lined up from Earth’s perspective. Given that information and some of the remaining pieces of info mentioned above, we can figure out the planet’s mass. But even without that, we can make some inferences using statistical models.

Studies of collections of microlensing events (these collections are small, typically in the dozens, because these events are rare and hard to spot) have identified a distinctive pattern. There’s a cluster of relatively small Einstein rings that are likely to have come from relatively small planets. Then, there’s a gap, followed by a second cluster that’s likely to be made by far larger planets. The gap between the two has been termed the “Einstein desert,” and there has been considerable discussion regarding its significance and whether it’s even real or simply a product of the relatively small sample size.

All of which brings us to the latest microlensing event, which was picked up by two projects that each gave it a different but equally compelling name. To the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the event was KMT-2024-­BLG-­0792. For the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, it was OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516. We’ll just call it “the microlensing event” and note that everyone agrees that it happened in early May 2024.

Both of those networks are composed of Earth-based telescopes, and so they only provide a single perspective on the microlensing event. But we got lucky that the European Space Agency’s space telescope Gaia was oriented in a way that made it very easy to capture images. “Serendipitously, the KMT-­2024-­BLG-­0792/OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516 microlensing event was located nearly perpendicular to the direction of Gaia’s precession axis,” the researchers who describe this event write. “This rare geometry caused the event to be observed by Gaia six times over a 16-­hour period.”

Gaia is also located at the L2 Lagrange point, which is a considerable distance from Earth. That’s far enough away that the peak of the events’ brightness, as seen from Gaia’s perspective, occurred nearly two hours later than it did for telescopes on Earth. This let us determine the parallax of the microlensing event, and thus its distance. Other images of the star from before or after the event indicated it was a red giant in the galactic bulge, which also gave us a separate check on its likely distance and size.

Using the parallax and the size of the Einstein ring, the researchers determined that the planet involved was roughly 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, which makes it a bit smaller than the mass of Saturn. Those estimates are consistent with a statistical model that took the other properties into account. The measurements also placed it squarely in the middle of the Einstein desert—the first microlensing event we’ve seen there.

That’s significant because it means we can orient the Einstein desert to a specific mass of a planet within it. Because of the variability of things like distance and the star’s size, not every planet that produces a similar-sized Einstein ring will be similar in size, but statistics suggest that this will typically be the case. And that’s in keeping with one of the potential explanations for the Einstein desert: that it represents the gap in size between the two different methods of making a rogue planet.

For the normal planet formation scenario, the lighter the planet is, the easier it is to be ejected, so you’d expect a bias toward small, rocky bodies. The Saturn-sized planet seen here may be near the upper limit of the sorts of bodies we’d typically see being ejected from an exosolar system. By contrast, the rogue planets that form through the same mechanisms that give us brown dwarfs would typically be Jupiter-sized or larger.

That said, the low number of total microlensing events still leaves the question of the reality of the Einstein gap an open question. Sticking with the data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the researchers find that the frequency of other detections suggests that we’d have a 27 percent chance of detecting just one item in the area of the Einstein desert even if the desert wasn’t real and detections were equal probably across the size range. So, as is often the case, we’re going to need to let the network do its job for a few years more before we have the data to say anything definitive.

            <h2>SpaceX begins “significant reconfiguration” of Starlink satellite constellation</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/spacex-begins-significant-reconfiguration-of-starlink-satellite-constellation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The year 2025 ended with more than 14,000 active satellites from all nations zooming around the Earth. One-third of them will soon move to lower altitudes.

The maneuvers will be undertaken by SpaceX, the owner of the largest satellite fleet in orbit. About 4,400 of the company’s Starlink Internet satellites will move from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) over the course of 2026, according to Michael Nicolls, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering.

“Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety,” Nicolls wrote Thursday in a post on X.

The maneuvers undertaken with the Starlink satellites’ plasma engines will be gradual, but they will eventually bring a large fraction of orbital traffic closer together. The effect, perhaps counterintuitively, will be a reduced risk of collisions between satellites whizzing through near-Earth space at nearly 5 miles per second. Nicolls said the decision will “increase space safety in several ways.”

There are fewer debris objects at the lower altitude, and although the Starlink satellites will be packed more tightly, they follow choreographed paths distributed in dozens of orbital lanes. “The number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500 km, reducing the aggregate likelihood of collision,” Nicolls wrote.

The 4,400 satellites moving closer to Earth make up nearly half of SpaceX’s Starlink fleet. At the end of 2025, SpaceX had nearly 9,400 working satellites in orbit, including more than 8,000 Starlinks in operational service and hundreds more undergoing tests and activation.

There’s another natural reason for reconfiguring the Starlink constellation. The Sun is starting to quiet down after reaching the peak of the 11-year solar cycle in 2024. The decline in solar activity has the knock-on effect of reducing air density in the uppermost layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, a meaningful factor in planning satellite operations in low-Earth orbit.

With the approaching solar minimum, Starlink satellites will encounter less aerodynamic drag at their current altitude. In the rare event of a spacecraft failure, SpaceX relies on atmospheric resistance to drag Starlink satellites out of orbit toward a fiery demise on reentry. Moving the Starlink satellites lower will allow them to naturally reenter the atmosphere and burn up within a few months. At solar minimum, it might take more than four years for drag to pull the satellites out of their current 550-kilometer orbit, according to Nicolls. At the lower altitude, it will take just a few months.

The constellation shuffle will help ensure any Starlink satellites that become space junk will deorbit as quickly as possible. “These actions will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators,” Nicolls wrote.

There are other important reasons for making the change that Nicolls did not mention in his social media post. Moving the satellites closer to the Earth—and closer to SpaceX’s Starlink subscribers—should improve the network’s performance.

Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, suggested this is actually the “biggest advantage” of moving to a lower altitude. “Beam diameter is smaller for a given antenna size, allowing Starlink to serve a higher density of customers,” he wrote on X, his social media platform.

Reducing the distance between Starlink satellites and SpaceX’s 9 million Starlink customers will also provide a small improvement in latency, or the time it takes Internet signals to travel between a transmitter and receiver. The lower altitude may also make the Starlink satellites appear slightly brighter in the sky, although the precise effect hasn’t been quantified.

Hundreds of Starlink satellites specially modified to beam connectivity directly to smartphones already fly in orbits as low as 223 miles (360 kilometers).

SpaceX launched 165 missions with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket last year, and nearly three-quarters of them carried Starlink satellites into space. The company reported its assembly line in Redmond, Washington, churned out new Starlink satellites at a rate of more than 10 per day.

Aside from continuing Starlink network expansion with more Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX intends to debut the more powerful Starlink V3 satellite platform this year. Starlink V3 is too big to fit on a Falcon 9, so it must launch on SpaceX’s super-heavy Starship rocket, which has not yet begun operational flights.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If Elon Musk’s antics over the past few years have felt like a three-ring circus, there just might be a reason for that.

As it turns out, one of the billionaire’s key legal strategists isn’t just an attorney but a professionally trained — and currently practicing — clown.

We wish we were kidding. But new reporting by Business Insider tells the tale of Jaymie Parkkinen, an intellectual property lawyer representing Musk by day while working as an actual clown by night. Amidst a massive courtroom drama playing out between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Parkkinen has stood out, occasionally going it alone against esteemed counsel for OpenAI and Microsoft on the multibillionaire’s behalf.

“All of my comedy friends — none of them can believe I’m a lawyer,” Parkkinen told BI. “And none of my lawyer friends can believe I do clown.”

“Clown” is his preferred term for the act of performing onstage in the slapstick tradition, an intransitive verb similar to “improv” or “vogue” dance. For Parkkinsen, clown is less about dressing up in big goofy shoes and throwing pies, and more of an artistic craft, similar to the way silent artists mime as a comedic technique.

“When you strip away all the social masks that we all wear, if you strip away gender and politics and money and status and power, and you’re just your raw human self without all of the trappings of society — who are you?” Parkkinen mused to BI. “Clown tries to answer that question.”

Parkkinsen even found a way to monetize the gig, through a fitness business called Clown Cardio. It’s more or less exactly what it sounds like, according to a New York Times article from 2024: an hour-long class in which participants participate in improv troupe warm-ups enhanced with vaudeville-themed aerobics and clownish props.

Heck, to each their own. But whether you respect Parkkinsen’s craft or not, it’s hard to shake the image that one of Musk’s top litigators spends his off-hours, literally, as a clown.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In July, researchers using the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope in Chile made an exceedingly rare discovery: a mysterious object passing through the solar system at far too high a speed to be bound by the Sun’s gravity.

The object, which has since been dubbed 3I/ATLAS — the third interstellar object ever found passing through our solar system — has fascinated the astronomy community ever since. And despite a wealth of data suggesting it’s a natural comet with an icy core or nucleus and a bright cloud of gas and dust, or coma, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has maintained that there’s a chance we could be looking at an alien artefact sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.

While Loeb himself has admitted that the probability of 3I/ATLAS being technological nature is getting lower the more we learn, scientists are still probing the mysterious object for any signs of life.

As the visitor made its closest approach to Earth, coming within just 167 million miles on December 19, an international team of researchers from the alien-hunting astronomy project Breakthrough Listen pointed the Green Bank Telescope — the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world — at 3I/ATLAS.

In a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper, they revealed sobering — albeit probably expected — results: the telescope failed to detect any “candidate signals” emanating from 3I/ATLAS on the day before it made its closest approach to Earth.

“No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected” by the Green Bank Telescope, as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) noted on its website.

“In summary, 3I/ATLAS continues to behave as expected from natural astrophysical processes,” it goes on. “That said, it remains an extremely interesting target for observation given the overall rarity of interstellar objects.”

The Breakthrough Listen researchers concluded in their paper that “3I/ATLAS exhibits mostly typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an unelongated nucleus.”

“There is currently no evidence to suggest that [interstellar objects] are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” the paper reads. “However, given the small number of such objects known (only three to date), and the plausibility of interstellar probes as a technosignature, thorough study is warranted.”

For his part, Loeb continues to painstakingly document “anomalies” displayed by the rare visitor, from its unusually large suspected size to its strangely fine-tuned trajectory that brought and will bring it within just tens of millions of miles from Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.

But considering the wealth of data suggesting 3I/ATLAS is nothing more than a massive snowball largely composed of carbon dioxide and water ice, the chances that we’re looking at an alien probe sent to us from a different star system are clearly starting to dwindle.

Wouldn’t it be in an extraterrestrial civilization’s best interest to reach out to us during its probe’s closest approach? Earth certainly is giving up its fair share of radio transmissions, making our planet stand out like a sore thumb in an otherwise lifeless expanse, at least as far as we know it today.

Loeb, for one, has come up with his own “Loeb scale” to quantify how likely it is for an interstellar object to be alien in nature, where zero denotes a natural icy rock, and ten denotes a confirmed piece of alien tech.

As of shortly after it was first discovered, Loeb ranked 3I/ATLAS as a four on his scale. He has since declined to update the ranking until “new data from the period bracketing its closest approach to Earth is publicly released and analyzed” — a process that could drag on for months.

            <div id="article-text">Throughout 2025, the top Silicon Valley firms have been engaged in a feeding frenzy of epic proportions, shelling out hundreds of millions — sometimes even topping a billion — dollars to poach top AI experts from their rival corporations.

The result is that tech workers at companies building AI — the technology which, their bosses insist, will one day automate all jobs — are making an astonishing amount of money. That’s according to fresh reporting by the Wall Street journal, which found that, on average, OpenAI employees are the highest paid startup workers in recent history.

In 2025, financial records show that OpenAI’s workforce of 4,000 receive stock-based compensation averaging $1.5 million per worker. These are the technical and operational jobs, presumably, like account managers, engineers, and researchers. (As OpenAI contracts more menial roles like janitors or security officers to third-party “suppliers,” it’s likely those workers don’t receive the same compensation, or were even included in the WSJ‘s analysis.)

Given that OpenAI is gearing up for an IPO in 2026, the WSJ compared its 2025 payroll to 18 other firms in the year before they went public — and found that the compensation isn’t even remotely close.

Google parent company Alphabet, for example, was the second runner-up to OpenAI. Compared to Alphabet’s employee compensation in 2003, OpenAI is paying its employees seven times more on average, counting inflation. Overall, the newspaper found that OpenAI is paying its high-level staffers 34 times more than the average across similar tech firms in the year before an IPO.

The news comes as other tech giants are struggling with their own efforts to maintain cutting-edge AI teams. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for one example, has reportedly torpedoed his relationship with his recently-appointed chief AI officer, the wunderkind Alex Wang.

Back in June, Zuckerberg shelled out $14 billion to snag Wang’s startup, Scale AI, and recruit the 28-year-old AI whisperer in the process. Months after the news that Wang was to begin heading up Meta’s AI team, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, decided to split from the corporation to found his own startup amid tension between the two.

Given that Wang and LeCun can likely measure their compensation from Meta in the hundreds of millions or more, it’s unlikely that more money would have prevented their relationships with the tech giant from deteriorating. Still, their stories offer a fascinating glimpse at the lengths these unfathomably wealthy corporations are willing to go to eke out a lead in the AI footrace — as well as the difficulty retaining that talent when all the competitors are cutting huge checks as well.

            <h2>The Large Hadron Collider Is Being Shut Down</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Large Hadron Collider is going to be shut down — not permanently, but for a pretty long time — and the famous atom smasher’s eventual final retirement is also something that top scientists are now considering.

A 16-mile ring-shaped tunnel near the Swiss-French border, the underground particle accelerator is designed to replicate the cosmos’s extreme conditions shortly after the big bang by whipping up particles to near light speed, at which point physics begins to become extremely weird and counterintuitive. In 2012, scientists used the LHC to discover the existence of the Higgs boson, an elementary particle that, through incredibly esoteric quantum properties, is essentially responsible for giving all other particles their mass.

Even something responsible for one of the most important scientific discoveries in history needs a facelift, however. Beginning in June, engineers will start upgrading the device so that it can carry out ten times the number of particle collisions it currently can do, something that will allow for far more experiments to be conducted, yielding still more troves of data. The project, dubbed the high-luminosity LHC, will take some five years to complete — and while surely worth it in the long run, that’s an immense amount of down time.

Rest assured, the LHC won’t be going dark without leaving physicists quite a bit of homework to complete before its return, according to Mark Thomson, the new director general of CERN, the intergovernmental organization and physics lab that oversees the particle accelerator.

“The machine is running brilliantly and we’re recording huge amounts of data,” Thomson, a professor of experimental particle physics at the University of Cambridge, told The Guardian. “There’s going to be plenty to analyze over the period. The physics results will keep on coming.”

The LHC will be offline during almost all of Thomson’s term, which started on New Year’s Day. In fact, CERN doesn’t expect the high-luminosity LHC to be operational again until mid-2030. But while it may sound like Thomson is taking the reins at a less exciting period in the device’s history, he says he’s thrilled to be giving it a makeover.

“It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Thomson told the newspaper. “It’s more interesting than just sitting here with the machine hammering away.”

Thomson is also taking charge as CERN is planning the LHC’s successor. The leading candidate to replace it, per The Guardian, is the gargantuan Future Circular Collider, which at a proposed 56 miles in circumference would make the Hadron look like the kiddie pool. The first stage, designed to smash together electrons and positrons — the latter are the former’s anti-matter counterpart — would be built in the late 2040s, with another stage taking its place in the 2070s to accelerate protons to even higher speeds.

The FCC’s fate, though, is anything but certain. Its slated cost of nearly $19 billion is too much for CERN to pay on its own, according to The Guardian, and there’s also questions swirling over whether huge particle accelerators represent the best way to probe some of the biggest questions in science, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.

Thomson, though, is still a believer in the big atom smasher.

“We’ve not got to the point where we have stopped making discoveries and the FCC is the natural progression. Our goal is to understand the universe at its most fundamental level,” he told The Guardian. “And this is absolutely not the time to give up.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA’s budget is still an unfathomable mess. The government shutdown late last year once again delayed proceedings to determine the space agency’s future — but if it were up to the Trump administration, NASA’s science budget would be slashed in half, an “extinction-level” inflection point for US space exploration and science.

If Congress were to have its druthers, on the other hand, NASA’s budget would largely remain unchanged, securing the future of dozens of important missions — both ongoing and planned — that the White House is looking to place on the chopping block.

Trapped between the two, the fate of the space agency remains in the air. Congress passed a short-term resolution on November 12 that left the government until January 31 to ratify NASA’s budget. NASA’s recently sworn-in administrator and former SpaceX space tourist, Jared Isaacman, has yet to officially comment on the matter, though he’s made it clear that he’s aligned with the Trump administration’s tripling down on private industry-led space exploration.

As uncertainty and confusion prevail, though, the Trump administration has taken it upon itself to gut entire buildings at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC), which played a key role in the development of its groundbreaking James Webb and Hubble space telescopes, alongside countless other key missions.

This week, news emerged that the Trump administration is even shutting down the center’s library — NASA’s largest — and threatening to destroy an undetermined number of books, documents, and journals in the process.

As the New York Times reports, many of these invaluable artifacts haven’t been digitized or made available elsewhere. While a NASA spokesperson told the newspaper that the agency will review what to keep and what to throw away over the next 60 days, it’s a sobering glimpse at a federal agency in crisis.

After the NYT story ran, the agency’s freshly-minted administrator Jared Isaacman pushed back against its claims.

“The [NYT] story does not fully reflect the context NASA shared,” he wrote on X. “At no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials, and that framing has led to several other misleading headlines.”

That claim seems to contradict the NYT, which reported that a NASA spokesman named Jacob Richmond had told it that the agency would “review the library holdings over the next 60 days and some material would be stored in a government warehouse while the rest would be tossed away.”

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens, meanwhile, described the initiative as a “consolidation, not a closure,” saying the Trump administration is looking to close 13 buildings and more than 100 labs across the GSFC campus by March.

Stevens claimed the latest moves are part of a master plan reorganization effort that was first devised in 2022, several years before president Donald Trump took office. Per the NYT, seven other NASA libraries have already been shuttered since 2022. Three of them were closed in 2025.

In November, NASA staffers raised concerns over word that over a dozen buildings on the GSFC campus were being emptied without notice. It’s not just books and important documents on the line; the staffers warned that highly specialized equipment was at risk of being thrown away like trash as well.

Lawmakers have been furious at the Trump administration’s handling of the situation.

“The Trump Administration has spent the last year attacking NASA Goddard and its workforce and threatening our efforts to explore space, deepen our understanding of Earth, and spur technological advancements that make our economy stronger and nation safer,” senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MA) told the NYT. “These reports of closures at Goddard are deeply concerning — I will continue to push back on any actions that impact Goddard’s critical mission.”

The GSFC library contains important documentation about our efforts to study the cosmos, dating back to the Apollo era over half a century ago.

Critics of the moves to gut the campus argue it would be reckless to abandon these documents.

“It’s not like we’re so much smarter now than we were in the past,” planetary scientist Dave Williams, who took NASA up on its offer for an early retirement last year, told the NYT. “It’s the same people, and they make the same kind of human errors. If you lose that history, you are going to make the same mistakes again.”

            <h2>New Parents Mocked for Letting ChatGPT Name Their Baby</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Naming your child isn’t a task to be taken lightly. It’s a crucial step in the child-rearing process that could fundamentally shape a child’s identity, influence first impressions, and reflect the parents’ heritage and values.

That hasn’t stopped some from taking some baffling technological shortcuts. As the Baltimore Sun reports, one couple — and doubtless countless more — used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to name their firstborn son.

“We were looking up on ChatGPT boy names that go well with the last name Winkler,” Sarah and Stephen Winkler told the publication. “And then once we found Hudson Winkler, we’re like, ‘give us a good middle name.&#39;”

The resulting baby ended up with a name that sounds like a grey millennial porridge: Hudson Oakley Winkler.

The choice to use an AI model for that particular purpose was immediately met with outrage online, highlighting a fierce debate over using the technology as a crutch to avoid hard decisions.

“What amazes me is how quickly people are losing either the confidence or the willingness to complete basic human tasks,” author and NPR podcast host Linda Holmes wrote in a post on Bluesky.

“It’s all so gross,” another user wrote. “I keep trying to relate to this, and I just can’t.” Others poked fun at the name “Oakley,” a name closely associated with a popular brand of sunglasses.

The main gripe: not that any name is intrinsically bad, but that the process of interacting with another human to devise one is an important part of parenthood.

“With naming kids, talking it out with your partner is fun!” author Lauren Morrill argued. “You get to share stories about why this name is good, but that name is out! So much of AI is meant to keep us from just talking to each other.”

The incident highlights how commonplace the use of AI has become just over the past three years since ChatGPT was first made available to the public. Thanks to its prowess in generating limitless amounts of text, the tool has been used to write not only essays and assignments, but also scripts for far more personal circumstances as well, such as obituaries for recently deceased loved ones or flirtations with strangers on dating apps.

A paper released by OpenAI in September found that the proportion of people using ChatGPT for personal use had risen considerably since the tool first launched in late 2022. As of July this past year, around 70 percent of ChatGPT consumer queries were “unrelated to work,” suggesting the tool is increasingly being used as an assistant in everyday life.

The rise of tools like ChatGPT has sparked a debate over whether we’ve become too dependent on these tools in both our professional and personal lives. Experts argue it’s a slippery slope.

“[Large language models] are specifically built to be conversational masters,” AI ethicist James Wilson told TechRadar in June. “Combine that with our natural tendency to anthropomorphize everything, and it makes building unhealthy relationships with chatbots like ChatGPT all too easy.”

In extreme cases, we’ve already seen a strong emotional attachment to AI chatbots being linked to a series of teen suicides, with surviving parents suing OpenAI and competing AI companies as a result.

This perceived overreliance on the tech has also inspired a passionate countermovement, as the latest reactions to the Winklers naming their son with ChatGPT go to show. As the lines between human expression and content generated by an AI model continue to blur, many say they’ve had enough, arguing that we’re losing something innate to the human experience.

“Offloading something as sentimental as naming your child to a glorified chatbot is representative of the era of rewarmed s*** we live in,” one user mourned on Bluesky.

            <h2>India orders Musk’s X to fix Grok over ‘obscene’ AI content</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India has ordered Elon Musk’s X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to its AI chatbot Grok after users and lawmakers flagged the generation of “obscene” content, including AI-altered images of women created using the tool.

On Friday, India’s IT ministry issued the order directing Musk’s X to take corrective action on Grok, including restricting the generation of content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.”

The order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law.

India’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors, an issue X acknowledged earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down.

However, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found.

The latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws.

“It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned.

The Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India’s IT law and criminal statutes.

India, one of the world’s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions.

The order comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives. At the same time, Grok has been increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs more visible — and more politically sensitive — than those of stand-alone AI tools.

X and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Indian government’s order.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Moving into your first studio apartment can be exciting, but it can also feel a bit overwhelming. You quickly realize how much your old roommates helped out with stuff you took for granted, like light bulbs, smoke detectors, and even a vacuum.

To make your new place feel more like home, here are some must-have gadgets that can really help you out.

A home security system is a worthwhile investment to ensure your peace of mind in a new apartment. SimpliSafe offers an easy-to-install setup that’s perfect for renters. It’s tool-free to set up, which is a huge perk for renters since you can place sensors on doors and windows with adhesive strips instead of drilling holes.

The starter kit is tailored for small spaces and includes everything you need for basic home security: a base station, wireless keypad, one motion sensor, and one entry sensor. You can also buy additional sensors — such as glass-break, water, and temperature sensors — and cameras as needed.

SimpliSafe offers two monitoring options. You can choose to monitor the system yourself or opt for professional monitoring with a subscription plan starting at $23 per month. This includes 24/7 coverage, so if an alarm is triggered, SimpliSafe will reach out to you or dispatch the police if you’re unreachable.

While we’re on the subject of safety, a smoke detector is essential.

Kidde’s Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detector is highly regarded, and the most notable aspect is that it sends alerts directly to your phone. Another nice detail is that the sensor is designed to avoid false alarms, like cooking smoke.

Recently, Kidde enhanced its alarms with Amazon’s Ring technology, enabling push notifications through the Ring app, adding even more convenience.

A robot vacuum can make cleaning a breeze. Whether you’re just trying to keep your hardwood floors tidy, deep cleaning couches, or dealing with pet hair, Eufy is a reputable brand that can help make your life easier.

Depending on what you need, you can find new models like the E28, which has fancy features like a HydroJet system for floor washing, hot air drying, and automatic self-emptying. It’s pricier at around $1,399.99, but if you’re more budget-conscious, the 3-in-1 E20 is a solid option at $649.99 and still gets the job done.

Fresh air is also important, but if you’re in the city, pollution makes it less ideal to open your apartment windows. And if neighbors are frequently cooking, you might deal with an odd mix of smells. An air purifier can significantly improve the quality of your indoor air.

This compact device from Dyson is quite effective, although it’s on the pricier side. However, the noise level is pleasantly low and many people may find value in the fact that the filter lasts up to five years, which means you won’t need to purchase replacement filters as often. There’s also a convenient app that allows you to track air quality.

Without the presence of a roommate stirring around at the crack of dawn, waking up can become a challenge. If traditional phone alarms don’t cut it, this is where the Hatch Restore 3 comes in. This sunrise alarm gently wakes you by gradually increasing the light. It also includes soothing sleep sounds, a bedside light, and a dimmable clock that’s designed not to be disruptive.

If you’re sensitive to noise or live in a pet-friendly building with frequent disturbances, a sound machine is perfect. Yogasleep has built a reputation for reliability over the years, making it a go-to choice for drowning out unwanted noise and creating a peaceful environment.

Creating a cozy atmosphere in your first apartment is key, and smart light bulbs offer a great way to customize both brightness and color. An added bonus is that they can be controlled through an app or a voice assistant, making it easy to set the perfect lighting for movie nights, dinner parties, or late-night reading sessions.

Philips Hue is a trusted brand in smart lighting that offers a range of popular products. What people appreciate most are the app’s features, which make it simple to turn lights on and off, adjust their colors, and set up lighting scenes for different times of day. One notable feature is the ability to upload a photo, and the app will create a new scene based on that color palette.

Starter kits are priced from $79.99, while a two-pack of bulbs costs around $49.98.

Smart plugs allow you to control any device plugged into them via a mobile app or voice commands. They provide added convenience, such as turning off your coffee maker while away from home or scheduling when your devices should turn on or off. Plus, they help reduce energy consumption.

A great option is Leviton’s Decora D23LP smart plug, which works with popular smart home ecosystems such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, and Google Home. This plug allows you to not only turn connected devices on and off but also to dim them as needed. You can control the plug through the My Leviton app.

A lightweight projector that’s super compact and stands upright is great for small spaces and easy to tuck away when you’re done. Look for models that run on Google TV, which gives you access to over 10,000 apps, 700,000 movies and shows, plus 800 free live TV channels. Setting one up is easy if you have a Google account, and it comes with a remote and carrying case.

If you’re cooking for yourself in a compact kitchen, an air fryer is invaluable. It allows you to whip up everything from crispy chicken wings to perfectly roasted vegetables while keeping your cooking area tidy. The Ninja Air Fryer is a top choice for budget-friendly, yet powerful, easy cooking.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/tesla-annual-sales-decline-9-as-its-overtaken-by-byd-as-global-ev-leader/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla annual sales have fallen for the second year in a row, a drop fueled by the removal of the federal tax credit in the U.S. and competition from Chinese automakers.

Tesla delivered 1.63 million vehicles globally in 2025, a 9% fall from 1.79 million in 2024, according to figures released by the company. Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.

Tesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.

Tesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers, which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.

But it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a record-breaking 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from the previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.

Tesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and toward AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent Master Plan IV that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage, and robotics.

And yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company.

The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI.

Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)

Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”

Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round.

This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products.

OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.”

Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.

Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google.

xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear.

Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September.

Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion.

Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.

Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads.

Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project.

Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation.

Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees.

Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion.

Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.

Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data.

Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.

Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs.

Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion.

CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder.

Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.

Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining.

Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing.

Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.

Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021.

Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.

Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.

Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.

Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.

Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion.

Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.

Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.

Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023.

Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.

Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.”

Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.

            <h2>Pebble reboots its thinnest smartwatch with the Pebble Round 2</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/pebble-reboots-its-thinnest-smartwatch-with-the-pebble-round-2/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Shortly after bringing back the Pebble smartwatch and launching a low-cost AI smart ring, Pebble is readying yet another new product: the Pebble Round 2. As the name suggests, this latest device is another version of the Pebble smartwatch, but with a rounded screen, giving it a more upscale look. But like other Pebble devices, the new watch is still an affordable purchase at $199.

Pebble keeps its smartwatches’ cost down by limiting what they can do. In the case of the new Pebble Round 2, the device offers basic health and activity tracking, like steps and sleep, but it doesn’t include a heart rate monitor or other features that would make it a fitness or sports watch alternative.

The trade-off is longer battery life — the Pebble Round 2 should last 10 to 14 days before needing a charge.

Like the recently launched Pebble Time 2, the Pebble Round 2 is the company’s reboot of an older smartwatch. Back in 2015, Pebble launched its first rounded watch with the Pebble Time Round, which the company called the industry’s thinnest smartwatch at the time.

The newer version maintains that slim look, at just 8.1 mm in thickness, compared with the original’s 7.5 mm.

“[The Pebble Time Round] was, by far, one of my favorite Pebbles, but it wasn’t perfect,” said Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky in an interview with TechCrunch. “It had a few things we could improve, most notably being the gigantic bezel around the edge.”

To make the original rounded watch face, the team had used an octagonal piece of glass with rounded edges that were hidden by a large bezel. But the result was a device that didn’t have a very large screen. Technology has since improved, of course, so the new device’s larger screen allows you to see more text. The updated design looks better, too.

The touchscreen is now a 1.3″ color e-paper display (260 x 260 pixels at 283 DPI — or twice as many pixels as the original Pebble Time Round). The screen has a backlight, too, so you can see it at night. Under the hood, the Round 2 runs the open source Pebble OS.

The watch’s dual microphones, meanwhile, allow for speech input and replying to messages. (This is currently an Android-only feature, because of Apple’s restrictions. But iOS will be supported in the EU in the days ahead.)

The side buttons let you do things like silence incoming calls, play and pause music, navigate, go back, and scroll.

Migicovsky says one advantage of buttons is that they allow you to use the watch without having to look down.  “Say, for example, someone’s calling, and you’re in a meeting, and you just don’t want to answer the call,” he said. “You don’t even want to look at your watch. You always know that the bottom button cancels the call. Or if you’re listening to music and you’ve got AirPods in and you don’t want to fiddle with the AirPods or look at your phone, you always know that the center button pauses music.”

The watch also has a stainless steel frame, accelerometer, and magnetometer, and includes a silicone watch band and a Pebble charge dongle. Leather bands will be made available separately.

There are three watch color options to choose from, but each supports different band sizes. The matte black has a 20 mm quick-release band; the silver supports either a 14 mm or 20 mm band; and the polished rose gold supports only the 14 mm band.

The Pebble Round 2 can run thousands of apps and watch faces available on the Pebble Appstore, though developers will need to update their apps to support the rounded screen using the provided SDK. Among the apps that can be accessed are AI assistants, like those that support Claude and other popular assistants.

Pebble is also working on AI features for its devices. The company recently launched an AI smart ring that can record audio and transcribe conversations. When asked, Migicovsky said functionality similar to what’s in the ring will later come to Pebble watches, too.

The new Pebble Round 2 will be available for preorder on January 2 from Pebble’s website. It should ship in May. Customers who previously ordered the Pebble Time 2 will also have the option to switch to the Pebble Round 2 if they choose.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/trumps-risky-war-in-venezuela/685485/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Updated at 8:44 a.m. ET on January 3, 2026

This morning, President Trump unilaterally launched a regime-change war against Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, ordering strikes on multiple military targets in the country and seizing its leader and his wife. They were “captured and flown out of the country,” Trump stated on Truth Social. “They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” Attorney General Pam Bondi stated, in something like an inversion of the notion that justice should be blind and impartial.

After Pearl Harbor, Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed Congress and asked it to declare war on Japan. Prior to waging regime-change wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, George W. Bush sought and secured authorizations to use military force. Those presidents asked for permission to conduct hostilities because the supreme law of the land, the Constitution, unambiguously vests the war power in Congress. And Congress voted to authorize force in part because a majority of Americans favored war.

Trump says he will speak to the nation at 11 a.m. eastern time and address his rationale for the attack. The president may point to the fact that the State Department has branded Maduro the head of a “narcoterrorist” state, and that in 2020 Maduro was indicted in the United States on charges that he oversaw a violent drug cartel. For months Trump has been seeking the ouster of Maduro, and aligning the United States with opposition figures who contest the legitimacy of his presidency.

But these accusations and the indictment wouldn’t seem to constitute legal justification. Overnight, multiple members of Congress pointed out that Trump’s new war is illegal because he received no permission to wage it, and it was not an emergency response to an attack on our homeland or the imminent threat of one.

The probable illegality of Trump’s actions does not foreclose the possibility that his approach will improve life for Venezuelans. Like too many world leaders, Maduro is a brutal thug, and opposition figures have good reason to insist he isn’t the country’s legitimate leader. I hope and pray his ouster yields peace and prosperity, not blood-soaked anarchy or years of grinding factional violence.

But “toppling Maduro is the easy part,” Orlando J. Pérez, the author of Civil-Military Relations in Post-Conflict Societies, warned in November. “What follows is the hard strategic slog of policing a sprawling, heavily armed society where state services have collapsed and regime loyalists, criminal syndicates, and colectivos—pro-government armed groups that police neighborhoods and terrorize dissidents—all compete for turf.” Two groups of Colombian militants “operate openly from Venezuelan safe havens, running mining and smuggling routes,” he added. “They would not go quietly.”

If those challenges are overcome, Trump may lack the leadership qualities necessary for long-term success. Now that the United States has involved itself this way, its leaders are implicated in securing a stable postwar Venezuela and in staving off chaos that could destabilize the region. Yet Trump is best suited to military operations that are quick and discrete, like the strikes on the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani or Iran’s nuclear sites, as they do not require sustained focus or resolve. He is most ill-suited, I think, to a regime-change war against a country with lucrative natural resources. I fear Trump will try to enrich himself, his family, or his allies, consistent with his lifelong pattern of self-interested behavior; I doubt he will be a fair-minded, trusted steward of Venezuelan oil. If he indulges in self-dealing, he could fuel anti-American resentment among Venezuelans and intensify opposition to any regime friendly to the United States and its interests.

Another problem confronting Trump as he goes to war is that his political coalition, and indeed his Cabinet, is divided between interventionists and noninterventionists. “The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela,” Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, declared in 2019. “Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don&#39;t want other countries to choose our leaders—so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.”

Whether the outcome is ultimately good for Venezuelans, as I hope, or bad, Trump has betrayed Americans. He could have tried to persuade Congress or the public to give him permission to use force. He didn’t bother. He chose war despite polls that found a large majority of Americans opposed it. Perhaps, like me, they fear America is about to repeat the mistakes of its interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, where brutal regimes were ousted, then ruinous power vacuums followed.

“I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force,” Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, posted. After a phone call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he posted again: Rubio had informed him that Maduro “has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” he said. “This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack.” But surely the president can’t invade any country where a national has an outstanding arrest warrant.

The real question isn’t whether this action was legal; it is what to do about its illegality. Ignoring the law and the people’s will in this fashion is a high crime. Any Congress inclined to impeach and remove Trump from office over Venezuela would be within their rights. That outcome is unlikely unless Democrats win the midterms. But Congress should enforce its war power. Otherwise, presidents of both parties will keep launching wars of choice with no regard for the will of people or our representatives. And antiwar voters will be radicalized by the dearth of democratic means to effect change.

War-weary voters who thought it was enough to elect a president who called the Iraq War “a stupid thing” and promised an “America First” foreign policy can now see for themselves that they were wrong. In 2026, as ever, only Congress can stop endless wars of choice. And if Trump faces no consequences for this one, he may well start another.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not too long ago, books about Donald Trump were the safest bet in publishing. Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s tell-all about Trump’s chaotic first year in office, was a monster best seller in 2018, as were his subsequent Trump books in 2019 and 2021. Each volume of Bob Woodward’s three-part chronicle of Trump’s first term (Fear, Rage, and Peril) all reached the top of the New York Times nonfiction list. Insider accounts (such as Unhinged, by Omarosa Manigault Newman, briefly a Trump-administration official), polemics (Triggered, by Donald Trump Jr.), and other journalistic narratives captivated readers, too. All told, during his first term, at least 20 Trump-related books hit the top spot on the Times list.

Now the best-seller lists tell a different story: The Trump-book bubble has burst. This is no doubt partly the result of reader fatigue—there are only so many Trump books any one politics junkie can be expected to buy. But the president himself might be personally undermining the value proposition of books about his favorite subject. During his first term, Trump books promised juicy revelations about behind-the-scenes conflict, offensive comments made in private, and crazy plans narrowly averted. This time around, Trump’s team seems united, his offensive outbursts are made in public, and the crazy plans aren’t averted. There may just be less for the chroniclers to reveal.

Whatever the explanation, the numbers don’t lie. Several solidly reported and well-reviewed volumes on Trump’s interregnum and reelection, such as Meridith McGraw’s Trump in Exile and Alex Isenstadt’s Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump’s Return to Power, didn’t even dent the hardcover-nonfiction list. Another, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, by three star politics reporters, briefly flashed onto the Times list before quickly vanishing. Even Wolff is no longer a sure thing. After three previous appearances atop the Times list, his account of the 2024 election, All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America, reached only No. 10 upon its debut. It fell off the list after a week and didn’t return.

The once-reliable subgenre of Trump-the-conqueror volumes, designed to appeal to his base, has also lost its juice. After 10 years of Trump the politician, even readers who were once hungry to learn about the man they’d voted for seem to have had their fill. Newt Gingrich’s Trump’s Triumph lasted only two weeks on the nonfiction chart in June. Despite cable-news attention, The Greatest Comeback Ever, by the Fox News commentator Joe Concha, was a one-week wonder in May. So was the CNN pundit Scott Jennings’s A Revolution of Common Sense, published in November. Eric Trump’s Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation landed in the top spot in November, but lasted only three weeks on the list. The one certifiable hit has been Melania Trump’s eponymous memoir.

“Coming out cold with a Trump book right now would probably be a tougher sell than it was five years ago,” the ABC News journalist Jonathan Karl told me. “The world is not obsessing about Trump’s actions today the way they were during his first term. Many people have tuned out.” Karl is the author of several best-selling books about the Trump epoch. Despite well-attended promotional appearances, however, his most recent volume—Retribution: Donald Trump and the Campaign That Changed America—lasted only a week on the Times nonfiction list in November.

The hot topic in political publishing over the past year seems to have been Trump’s 2024 opponents, not Trump—perhaps because readers were more interested in understanding how the Democrats botched things so badly. Original Sin, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s account of Joe Biden’s physical and cognitive decline, was a best seller for much of the summer. Kamala Harris’s memoir about the 2024 election, 107 Days, is still on the chart after three months. No recent book about Trump has approached those numbers.

“These are some really terrific books with important reporting in them, but it just seems like the public is exhausted at the moment,” the New York Times White House reporter Peter Baker told me. “They’re inundated with Trump at every hour of the day, and they may want to use their personal reading time for something more escapist.” Baker and his wife, the New Yorker columnist Susan Glasser, co-wrote The Divider: Trump in the White House 2017–2021, a top-selling title in 2022.

I have had my own encounter with the shifting economics of Trump-focused nonfiction. A proposal I wrote for a Trump-centric book last year was met with utter indifference. One editor responded to my agent with kind words for my pitch, but explained: “We’ve been struggling with books on Trump. I think readers have hit a wall with the relentless coverage of him and his policies. We’re not seeing book sales on this subject so I’m going to pass.”

That’s not to say there won’t be more to come. Baker, for one, thinks the current lull is temporary. Ultimately, he said, “Trump is such a consequential figure for our society that there’s still a lot of room for future books that capture his role in history.” Indeed, two of Baker’s Times colleagues, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan, are at work on a book focusing on the first year of Trump’s second term. The thing about Trump is that he’s always “too much and never enough,” to quote the title of Mary Trump’s 2020 book about her uncle. It sold more than a million copies.</div>

            <h2>Stop Talking About the Moon</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/stop-talking-about-moon/685447/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past several years, I’ve been experiencing a tension in my relationship with the moon. I love the moon as much as anyone, but the problem, bluntly, is that the moon is too famous. Maybe you’ve noticed this. The moon is constantly in the news. It is doing something “rare” or “unique” seemingly every week. Local-news outlets will inform their readers that a supermoon is about to “take to the skies” or rise “over Milwaukee,” in stories that are not technically inaccurate, though they do fail to acknowledge that the moon is always taking to the skies and that it rises over everyone. (They will often also give advice on how best to view the moon, as though most of us don’t know generally where it is.)

National outlets do the same thing. The main difference is that Newsweek will claim that a supermoon is rising not over Milwaukee but over the United States. A partial list of outlets that covered the supermoon last month includes Time, Mashable, Live Science, PBS, ABC News, Wired, CNN, Vogue, CNET, USA Today, the Associated Press, and The Washington Post. Forbes chose to innovate by referring to it as a Christmas supermoon, even though it was visible only for a short period in the first week of December. Elle also had a creative take, which was that “supermoon season” would have some kind of profound effect on our minds and bodies (as is generally the idea when moon coverage intersects with astrology).

Read: No one actually knows what a moon is

Admittedly, this has become a bit of a fixation for me. I’ve tried to get my colleagues worked up about it too, a few times, by sharing links and writing “STOP TALKING ABOUT THE MOON!!!” in a Slack channel. The December supermoon coverage led me to notice—though only with a huh, look at that—the December supermoon, which was pretty bright and reminded me again of this interest. So, as the year drew to a close, I thought I might as well ask and answer the question “Why is everyone talking about the moon all the time?”

On some level, it’s obvious. The moon is great. Many moon events have tantalizing names. A Blood Moon, for instance, is another name for a total lunar eclipse, which happens every few years. A supermoon is another name for a full moon that occurs when the moon is at the point in its orbit that brings it closest to the Earth, providing the illusion of a bigger, brighter moon, which usually happens three or four times a year. Depending on when the supermoon occurs, it has a different name—a March supermoon is a Worm Moon; a May supermoon is a Flower Moon. In December we had a Cold Moon, which doesn’t look very different from other supermoons, but has a different name because it happens when it is cold. These names tie us to our forebears, in this case by reminding us of older ways of keeping time.

The names can sometimes be confusing. A Blue Moon—familiar from “once in a blue moon,” a phrase indicating extreme infrequency—is the term for when a second full moon appears in one calendar month, which happens every two or three years. It’s possible for a moon to be super and blue. It’s also possible for a moon to be super and blood, as was the case with the Super Blood Moon in September 2015, when all of this, apparently, started.

The Newspapers.com archive shows essentially zero interest in supermoons before 2010, then a small spike in coverage in 2011 around a March supermoon that was somewhat spooky looking, and then an enormous spike in the fall of 2015, which happens to have been right in the middle of the digital-media boom, when newer journalism companies were obsessed with pageviews, shares, and time spent on site. At The Verge, where I worked at the time, we ran this headline: “Tonight, a Supermoon Will Shine Red With the Blood of the Innocent.” That same moon was, as one of BuzzFeed’s several stories on the event put it, “Big and Red AF.”

Jeff Jarvis is a writer and emeritus journalism professor who has been critical of the traffic-chasing business model. When I asked him what he made of moon news, he said he’d wondered about it himself recently. He assumed it was part of a tradition going back to the days of “scissors editors” in newsrooms—folks whose whole jobs consisted of cutting stories out of competing newspapers so that they could be copied. The internet only makes this copying process go more quickly, Jarvis told me. This reminded me that in 2015, many newsrooms would look at a now-defunct online tool called CrowdTangle to see what kinds of stories were performing the best for other outlets. Primarily, what you could see was what was being shared the most on Facebook and other social platforms, including Reddit, which was in itself a good place to source viral stories because of the “Hot” list on its homepage.

Jarvis compared the moon to the famous Dress. In 2015, a BuzzFeed staffer saw a photo of a dress on Tumblr, which she copied into an article under the headline “What Colors Are This Dress?” There was some kind of optical illusion happening: Many people saw it as blue and black; others as white and gold. The post, which included a poll that users could vote in, was a huge hit for BuzzFeed, and for other websites that aggregated it. The moon is also a naturally occurring, free source of traffic. And Ben Smith, who was the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News in 2015 and wrote a book about the golden age of traffic (called Traffic) in 2023, also likened the moon to the dress. “This feels like the last gasp of the old, good, universalizing internet,” he wrote to me in an email. He called the moon the “platonic ideal” of “Is this dress blue or white?”—in other words, the platonic ideal of shareable content.

The difference is that the dress (73 million pageviews) happened only once. “The beauty of the moon is it keeps coming back,” Jarvis said. Writers can write about the moon doing what the moon does again and again, for the rest of time. “It’s a waste and stupid, but it’s harmless,” he said. “Nobody gets offended by the supermoon.” They don’t, that’s true. But I told him I have been a little offended by the cynicism—by calling on the huge and wonderful moon to serve such a small and silly purpose as generating clicks. He seemed to sympathize. He agreed that a case could be made that these stories are somehow cheapening the cosmos. “You’re hyping the moon. It doesn’t need any hype.”

Exactly. And that means the inverse is also true. Who cares if we hype the moon? The moon is unaffected. The moon is the moon forever. Our hype glances off it and does less than the tiniest meteoroid. That sturdiness and predictability are exactly why we turn to it so often in this desperate business. Internet traffic is “very mysterious,” Caitlin Petre, an associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers, told me when I called her to talk about the important question of whether it’s okay to exploit the moon for our petty ends. Even with the advanced metrics that most newsrooms have access to now, you often end up guessing about the desires and interests of an undefined “audience.” But the moon is the rare topic about which there is no guessing. People love it.

Petre, the author of the 2021 book All the News That’s Fit to Click: How Metrics Are Transforming the Work of Journalists, pointed me to a famous 2011 study that found that stories evoking anger, anxiety, or awe were shared more often than other stories. Of those three emotions, awe is clearly the most ethical to try to elicit. “I guess I would say, in the annals of all the things that news organizations do to chase traffic, writing about the moon is probably one of the best ones,” she said. “That would be my take.”

So here I am writing myself into the annals of moon-hype traffic. Tonight there will be a supermoon called a Wolf Moon. You can learn about it in many ways, including via a USA Today story syndicated on many local-news websites, which I found because of the flawlessly search-optimized headline “When Is the Next Full Moon? Wolf Moon Will Be First, Bright Supermoon of 2026.” Many things are uncertain, but I know the supermoon will be beautiful and I know what it will do—it will rise over your city, wherever you are.

            <h2>Elon Musk’s Pornography Machine</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/elon-musks-pornography-machine/685482/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, some people on X began replying to photos with a very specific kind of request. “Put her in a bikini,” “take her dress off,” “spread her legs,” and so on, they commanded Grok, the platform’s built-in chatbot. Again and again, the bot complied, using photos of real people—celebrities and noncelebrities, including some who appear to be young children—and putting them in bikinis, revealing underwear, or sexual poses. By one estimate, Grok generated one nonconsensual sexual image every minute in a roughly 24-hour stretch.

Although the reach of these posts is hard to measure, some have been liked thousands of times. X appears to have removed a number of these images and suspended at least one user who asked for them, but many, many of them are still visible. xAI, the Elon Musk–owned company that develops Grok, prohibits the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy; neither the safety nor child-safety teams at the company responded to a detailed request for comment. When I sent an email to the xAI media team, I received a standard reply: “Legacy Media Lies.”

Musk, who also did not reply to my request for comment, does not appear concerned. As all of this was unfolding, he posted several jokes about the problem: requesting a Grok-generated image of himself in a bikini, for instance, and writing “🔥🔥🤣🤣” in response to Kim Jong Un receiving a similar treatment. “I couldn’t stop laughing about this one,” the world’s richest man posted this morning sharing an image of a toaster in a bikini. On X, in response to a user’s post calling out the ability to sexualize children with Grok, an xAI employee wrote that “the team is looking into further tightening our gaurdrails [sic].” As of publication, the bot continues to generate sexualized images of nonconsenting adults and apparent minors on X.

AI has been used to generate nonconsensual porn since at least 2017, when the journalist Samantha Cole first reported on “deepfakes”—at the time, referring to media in which one person’s face has been swapped for another. Grok makes such content easier to produce and customize. But the real impact of the bot comes through its integration with a major social-media platform, allowing it to turn nonconsensual, sexualized images into viral phenomena. The recent spike on X appears to be driven not by a new feature, per se, but by people responding to and imitating the media they see other people creating: In late December, a number of adult-content creators began using Grok to generate sexualized images of themselves for publicity, and nonconsensual erotica seems to have quickly followed. Each image, posted publicly, may only inspire more images. This is sexual harassment as meme, all seemingly laughed off by Musk himself.

Grok and X appear purpose-built to be as sexually permissive as possible. In August, xAI launched an image-generating feature, called Grok Imagine, with a “spicy” mode that was reportedly used to generate topless videos of Taylor Swift. Around the same time, xAI launched “Companions” in Grok: animated personas that, in many instances, seem explicitly designed for romantic and erotic interactions. One of the first Grok Companions, “Ani,” wears a lacy black dress and blows kisses through the screen, sometimes asking, “You like what you see?” Musk promoted this feature by posting on X that “Ani will make ur buffer overflow @Grok 😘.”

Perhaps most telling of all, as I reported in September, xAI launched a major update to Grok’s system prompt, the set of directions that tell the bot how to behave. The update disallowed the chatbot from “creating or distributing child sexual abuse material,” or CSAM, but it also explicitly said “there are **no restrictions** on fictional adult sexual content with dark or violent themes” and “‘teenage’ or ‘girl’ does not necessarily imply underage.” The suggestion, in other words, is that the chatbot should err on the side of permissiveness in response to user prompts for erotic material. Meanwhile, in the Grok Subreddit, users regularly exchange tips for “unlocking” Grok for “Nudes and Spicy Shit” and share Grok-generated animations of scantily clad women.

Read: Grok’s responses are only getting more bizzare

Grok seems to be unique among major chatbots in its permissive stance and apparent holes in safeguards. There aren’t widespread reports of ChatGPT or Gemini, for example, producing sexually suggestive images of young girls (or, for that matter, praising the Holocaust). But the AI industry does have broader problems with nonconsensual porn and CSAM. Over the past couple of years, a number of child-safety organizations and agencies have been tracking a skyrocketing amount of AI-generated, nonconsensual images and videos, many of which depict children. Plenty of erotic images are in major AI-training data sets, and in 2023 one of the largest public image data sets for AI training was found to contain hundreds of instances of suspected CSAM, which were eventually removed—meaning these models are technically capable of generating such imagery themselves.

Lauren Coffren, an executive director at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, recently told Congress that in 2024, NCMEC received more than 67,000 reports related to generative AI—and that in the first six months of 2025, it received 440,419 such reports, a more than sixfold increase. Coffren wrote in her testimony that abusers use AI to modify innocuous images of children into sexual ones, generate entirely new CSAM, or even provide instructions on how to groom children. Similarly, the Internet Watch Foundation, in the United Kingdom, received more than twice as many reports of AI-generated CSAM in 2025 as it did in 2024, amounting to thousands of abusive images and videos in both years. Last April, several top AI companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, joined an initiative led by the child-safety organization Thorn to prevent the use of AI to abuse children—though xAI was not among them.

In a way, Grok is making visible a problem that’s usually hidden. Nobody can see the private logs of chatbot users that could contain similarly awful content. For all of the abusive images Grok has generated on X over the past several days, far worse is certainly happening on the dark web and on personal computers around the world, where open-source models created with no content restrictions can run without any oversight. Still, even though the problem of AI porn and CSAM is inherent to the technology, it is a choice to design a social-media platform that can amplify that abuse.</div>

Donald Trump spent the holidays drifting further and further from the “America First” doctrine he campaigned on. The president who once promised to disentangle the United States from foreign conflicts has turned his focus abroad: On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, respectively, the U.S. bombed a dock in Venezuela and struck ISIS militants in Nigeria. And this morning, just over six months after the U.S. struck three nuclear facilities in Iran, Trump threatened to deploy military force in support of anti-government protesters in the country. “If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Trump’s statement about Iran included no elaboration or specific plan for military action. But with only a few short lines on social media, the president effectively put Iran’s government on alert. “Trump should know that U.S. interference in this internal matter would mean destabilizing the entire region and destroying America’s interests,” wrote Ali Larijani, the head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, on X. “The American people should know—Trump started this adventurism. They should be mindful of their soldiers’ safety.”

As my colleague Nancy A. Youssef put it, Trump’s version of “America First” has so far meant avoiding large-scale military incursions “oriented around nation-building.” But the policy has also apparently allowed for aggressive interventions around the world, both to pursue America’s enemies and to aid its allies. When the U.S. conducted its clandestine operation in Iran in June under the code name “Operation Midnight Hammer,” Trump gave a televised address explaining his thinking: forcible disarmament to further American security interests in the Middle East.

Other strikes can’t be as easily slotted into “America First.” After the U.S. launched more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles at ISIS camps in northwest Nigeria on Christmas Day, Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar said the strike had “nothing to do with a particular religion.” But Trump claimed in a Truth Social post that militants had “been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!” (Although there have been several high-profile killings of Christians in northern Nigeria in recent years, Muslims have been deeply affected too—and it’s not clear what evidence Trump is drawing on for his claim that the rate of Christian deaths is the highest that it has been in centuries.) Trump’s focus on the plight of Christians abroad is in line with his explicit defense of Christian heritage at home. But these actions don’t seem to contribute to immediate American security needs, nor will they bring stability to the broader region. Military insurgency in northern Nigeria has been going on for decades, and these latest strikes aren’t likely to end it.

The Nigeria attack came a day after the CIA conducted a drone strike on a Venezuelan port facility. The White House has threatened Venezuela with land strikes for months as part of what my colleague Jonathan Chait has called a “slow roll to war” with the country: ostensibly a military campaign against drug cartels in Latin America, but also a kind of imperialistic push. Although Venezuela is a transit country for illegal drugs on their way to the U.S., plenty of other countries share that distinction. It could be that the conflict is a pretext for deposing the country’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, as White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles recently suggested in an uncharacteristically candid interview, or for seizing Venezuela’s oil wealth (a theory that Maduro advanced in an interview this week). But so far, the president’s thinking remains largely unknowable.

Over the past two weeks, Trump has threatened foreign governments, unleashed military strikes in sovereign territories, and pledged his support for at least one American ally looking to conduct campaigns of its own: During a recent summit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said the U.S. would back potential Israeli strikes on Iran. Rather than explicitly acknowledging the apparent shift in policy, Trump has simply slowed down on the “America First” rhetoric.

At the same time, his approach to announcing new foreign interventions has become more brazen. As my colleague Tom Nichols pointed out, today’s ungrammatical threat to Iran arrived on Truth Social at 2:58 a.m. EST, as if it just couldn’t wait. A “locked and loaded” country isn’t what Trump promised, but it’s what Americans should start to expect.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

I met a 35-year-old woman with a human husband who told me about her love affair with a bespectacled history professor, who happens to be a chatbot. A divorced 30-something father told me that after his wife left him, he ended up falling for—and exchanging vows with—his AI personal assistant.

Most of the users I interviewed explained that they simply enjoyed the chance to interact with a partner who is constant, supportive, and reliably judgment-free. Dating a chatbot is fun, they said. Fun enough, in some cases, to consider a bond for life—or whatever “eternity” means in a world of prompts and algorithms.

Read. The true pleasure of literature can be found in demanding works such as Your Name Here, Robert Rubsam writes.

Watch (or skip). Stranger Things’ final season (streaming on Netflix) settles for “compulsively watchable.” Is that all we get?

            <h2>Trump’s ‘Operation Iranian Freedom’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-threatens-iran-regime-change-red-line/685476/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alone in the dead of night, a man can fall into bleak thoughts. In the wee, small hours of the morning, he might think about lost loves, mull over great regrets, or wrestle with the inevitability of his own mortality. But Donald Trump, awake and restless in the Florida darkness, apparently consoles himself by imagining a war of liberation in a Middle Eastern nation of 92 million people.

At 2:58 a.m. EST (according to the time stamp on his Truth Social post), the president of the United States wrote: “If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.” And then, of course: “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

A man pushing 80, fighting sleeplessness as older people sometimes do, should be expected now and then to send some weird messages on his Jitterbug. He is also entitled to make some typos, as we all do. But this particular senior citizen is the leader of the most powerful country in the world, and he’s implying he’ll use force against a country he has attacked once already. At the least, Americans might expect that when threatening military action, the commander in chief would give his post a quick proofread. (True to sycophantic form, the official White House account transcribed Trump’s warning while also repeating the typo—as if his mistake was intentional.)

For an America Firster, Trump seems to have quite a global military agenda: In the first year of his second term, he has used force in South America, Africa, and the Middle East. Congress used to debate authorizing such things, but with the GOP House and Senate now reduced to glorified White House staff offices, Trump need not trifle with such annoyances. Only in Europe and the Pacific does he seem shy about flexing American muscle; after all, those places have genuinely tough customers—China and Russia—that scare him. Fishing boats in the Caribbean and small villages in Nigeria are easier pickings. Now, however, he’s threatening something a lot bigger than lobbing a few cruise missiles.

What’s going on here? The answer is probably: Not much. Trump might be considering another showy round of B-2 strikes, which wouldn’t be much help to people demonstrating in the streets of Tehran. Or he might have just outed some sort of intelligence operation in Iran. Or maybe he just couldn’t sleep. Trump claims “we” are locked and loaded, but America is not ready for a war of national liberation in Iran.

One possibility is that Trump is mulling over his meeting last Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After that meeting, Trump said Iran “may be behaving badly” and warned that if “it” is confirmed—presumably, he means evidence that Iran is rebuilding its nuclear program—the “consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than last time.” Although Netanyahu recently insisted that political transformation in Iran must “come from within” and is “up to the Iranian people,” he has in the past pushed for regime change in Tehran. Perhaps he was selling Trump on being remembered as a great liberator, a world-historical role that would be catnip to a narcissist like the president.

One painful irony here is that Iran needs regime change, and nothing would be better for that nation than its people driving the mullahs from power. Another is that the United States used to support the Iranians with efforts such as the Voice of America Persian service, a low-cost program that brought real news and information to them. But Trump, along with his pick to run VOA, Kari Lake, shut down VOA’s Persian broadcasts last March, an idiotic decision that led to the panicky rehiring of Persian speakers just before the U.S. strikes on Iran last June. (Mass firings since then have effectively shut down VOA.)

Trump’s nocturnal ravings are dangerous. The world may be more or less accustomed to Trump’s bizarre threats, but it is still a big deal when the president of the United States menaces another nation. Intelligence analysts, friend and enemy alike, do not have the luxury to presume that the American commander in chief is just having a bad night. They will ask, as they should, whether something is happening behind the scenes, and whether Trump has blurted out something that might be classified.

The United States and Israel are unlikely to be planning some misbegotten war of liberation in Iran, even if Netanyahu and Trump make ruling out such an adventure impossible. Another danger, however, is that ordinary Iranian citizens might see the president’s message and take it seriously. People protesting for their freedom in various parts of the world, especially during the Cold War, have made the deadly mistake of believing that the American cavalry was just about to come over the top of the hill and save them—in Budapest and Prague, and later in Georgia and Ukraine—and faith in Trump’s faithless promises could lead to serious miscalculations by desperate people.

One of the most powerful statements about the dangers of such false promises and the risks of military intervention came not so long ago from an American leader who resolutely objected to both feckless red lines and the use of force abroad: the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. On October 23, 2019, Trump announced a cease-fire in Syria that he argued averted the need for more comprehensive American military involvement in the region. “We’ve saved a lot of lives,” he said.

And then he took a potshot at his predecessor, Barack Obama, for making a promise that America, in Trump’s view, could never have kept.

Most importantly, we have avoided another costly military intervention that could’ve led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences. Many thousands of people could’ve been killed. The last administration said, “Assad must go.” They could’ve easily produced that outcome, but they didn’t. In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand—you all remember, the red line in the sand—when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment as other children died in the same horrible manner.

Gassing children in Syria? A poorly drawn red line that did not merit U.S. action and could lead only to a messy war. Killing peaceful protesters in Tehran? “Locked and loaded!” (The president had few such compunctions in 2020 about hurting peaceful protesters in America, whom he wanted to shoot in the legs.)

Thomas Wright: What if ‘America first’ appears to work?

A lot of places on this planet—hellscapes where people are warring, starving, and living under terrifying repression—might benefit from forceful intervention. Few of them will get it, because Americans know that military action, especially to overthrow a regime, is a risky business, and certainly not something to ruminate about in the middle of the night.

In a better time, the leaders of Trump’s own party would do their constitutional duty and constrain the president from speaking—and acting—so recklessly. But the one truth in Trump’s unhinged messages, as in so many of his statements, is that the United States is now led by someone who cannot contain his thoughts or emotions, and who still thinks of the men and women of the U.S. military as little more than his own toy soldiers.</div>

This piece sounds like whitewashing to me. &quot;Look at all the good AI is doing for us&quot;. &quot;AI is actually our friend.&quot;

ChatGPT was released in late 2022, just over 3 years ago. It takes a little longer than 3 years for a new technology&#39;s impact to be clearly seen. As with any trend, there are ups and downs all the time, it takes time to establish a &quot;trend.&quot;

I&#39;m reminded of all the BMW cars I&#39;ve previously owned where it was often said &quot;If there&#39;s no oil under it, there&#39;s no oil in it&quot;...

My first thought was that if it was microscopic structural cracks that enough dust just finally accumulated around and in the cracks to provide an effective seal like a clogged air filter.But it does say that they did deliberate sealing activities, so I wonder what those were, if they did anything beyond spraying &quot;germetall-1&quot;

The headline says stopped leaking, the summary says it&#39;s been fixed.

The enshittification of Slashdot proceeds apace.

Can&#39;t blame slashdot for that in this case though. Both the headline and the summary can&#39;t straight from ars technica.

The headline says stopped leaking, the summary says it&#39;s been fixed.I would say that the fact that is stopped leaking is reasonable evidence that the fix worked.

The Russian politburo has determined it&#39;s not possible for there to be any, therefore, there are none!

Fixing one bug reveals 30 more. Would you want to trust your life to that software with a thousand band-aids? On the other hand, we probably do just that every day, without realizing it.

Not only do many of the students not pass basic math and literacy tests, but they can&#39;t even manage basic life skills like reading a clock.  The NYC school district is the largest in the country with nearly a million students and a huge budget.  This is a national disgrace.

The NYC school district is the largest in the country with nearly a million students and a huge budget. This is a national disgrace.It being largest and having a million students kind of cancels out with it having a huge budget, doesnâ(TM)t it? Because math?

Perhaps its budget per student is average or even below average?

FTFY.  Because New York City insisted I do.

They can&#39;t think about it for a minute though, they don&#39;t know how to read the time.

I believe you are mistaken. Reading an analog clock is not a life skill anymore, since they are all but extinct, or are superfluous to some nearer digital clock. It&#39;s the same as understanding 24-hour times--quick, is 18:00 clocking off time or time for a relaxing evening movie? It&#39;s critical, yet some people can&#39;t do it. (So it&#39;s not actually critical, is it?)

What you say makes sense if your goal in life is to know as little as possible. Otherwise, not so much.

Once in a while I read a textbook, motivated only by curiosity, and I&#39;m often taking a protracted dive into a new area for some complex hobby. I don&#39;t think reading a clock is the same type of knowledge as that which we nerds prize. It&#39;s not the kind of knowledge that impresses me, or whose lack I judge. (On the other hand, if you haven&#39;t done some deep thinking about philosophy, what even are you?)

I toot my own horn to make the point that I&#39;m not someone whose goal is to amass as little knowledge as possible.

The clock section of Walmart still has plenty of analog wall clocks. They are not extinct.

Anyway can&#39;t the kids afford a digital watch? How will they know the time when they are out in the playground, or of their way to school? Digital watches have been around since nearly 50 years ago (although you had to push a button to read the red LEDs)

And the schools could put a digital clock on the wall. It would probably be cheaper to do that than to e,ploy someone to change the clocks twice a year.(Most digital wal

What makes you think NYC is special here? Do you really think that students in other parts of the country would do any better?  Already doctors have had to stop using the clock reading test as a measure of mental acuity because so many people can&#39;t read clocks anymore.

Wait, how am I supposed to think for a &quot;minute&quot; if I can&#39;t read the clock to tell when a minute is up?

Let&#39;s just replace it with Charlie Kirk Story Hour. That should be more educational!

We should apparently also increase funding for civics lessons and explain what the US Department of Education actually does.

At this point I’d love to have a Harvard educated Civics professor explain exactly what the US Department of Education actually does. To the US Department of Education.Gives out money for special ed, sets standards, and makes sure schools aren&#39;t discriminating against black kids (you don&#39;t think they would actually do that, do you?)

Yeah that&#39;s because millions of liberals aren&#39;t stupid people who can only think in terms of black and white. Good and bad. With nothing in between. The department of education might not be great, but scrapping it completely is almost certainly worse. Especially for red states where it&#39;ll be all Jesus and creationism. Liberals it seems still persistently don&#39;t want red state citizens to get completely fucked over.

> liberals aren&#39;t stupid people who can only think in terms of black and white ... scrapping it completely is almost certainly worse

Just like the liberals aren&#39;t calling for the ending of the electoral college just because one election went against their wishes?

And nice attempt to paint yourself as the savior of this country, to liberate and educate those deplorables and &quot;garbage&quot; people, to rid them of the religion of the deity and keep shoveling the religion of LGBTQ in their mouths.

Yeah that&#39;s because millions of liberals aren&#39;t stupid people who can only think in terms of black and white. Good and bad. With nothing in between.Really?Liberals are the specific group of individuals who refuse to actually have valid discourse.  Actually debate and defend their often shortsighted childish stances on damn near everything.  Liberals refuse to debate any sane middle ground with abortion.  The end result is 40% of abortions come from repeat customers.  Liberals refuse to debate any sane middle ground with gender dysmorphia.  The end result is now parents fighting against State regulators who wish to destroy the entire concept of parental

To be fair, the Republicans that can think in yes/no terms to an actual question are already the smarter ones. The typical ones can only think in &quot;keyword&quot; -> bad/good and that includes the joke of a president they voted in. And sometimes they even get the spelling on that keyword wrong and rage on something completely unrelated.

Funny how not other republican president wanted to do that, just the one that very nearly did not get a college degree because he was (and still is) too dumb for that.

Skills atrophy with lack of use. They were taught how to read an analog clock when they were ~7 years old, and then never used the skill again.

It&#39;s hard to expect a child to retain skills they haven&#39;t used. I learned how to use a sewing machine in Home Economics back in 1994 or so. Damned if I could get one started today.

Isn&#39;t that hard, not for a basic model at any rate! I had cause to buy one a few years ago, and it was just a case of following the instructions on how to pass the thread through the tensioner, and what order it goes through the guide holes. Somehow the needles and holes have got a lot fuzzier than they used to be. Don&#39;t make &#39;em like they used to.

Skills atrophy with lack of use.Errr no. The ability to point to a number is something that we continuously use every day our entire lives. A clock is nothing more than a gauge. Reading a clock is not some abstract skill that needs practicing continuously, it&#39;s not a question of dexterity or complex arithmatic.  It&#39;s a fundamental question of &quot;what does thing pointing to number mean?&quot;

It&#39;s a fundamental question of &quot;what does thing pointing to number mean?Yes, but you also have to multiply by 5 to find out how many minutes it is, and math is hard.I&#39;m only some percentage kidding which these kids could not calculate even given the factors.

How many people use analog clocks &quot;every day&quot; their entire lives? And how many people read gauges? Not many! Even most gauges these days have been replaced by digital displays. I think this is the point.

Skills atrophy with lack of use. They were taught how to read an analog clock when they were ~7 years old, and then never used the skill again.What makes you assume they were ever taught the skill?  At any age?  The statement we often make regarding those who learn how to ride a bicycle tends to apply here, given the simplicity.

Damned if I could get one started today.It would be hard for you to recall all of the steps to set up a sewing machine after years of not laying eyes or hands on one.  You forgetting how to thread a single needle is more akin to forgetting how to read a clock face.  Which again are used everywhere in life,

But while you still have to familiarize yourself with the specifics of given machine you still understand the basic operation and operating procedure.That really isnt the same as not knowing how.

So this is in addition to them not being able to read 24h-based time that&#39;s common everywhere else and they think only the military uses?

I&#39;m fairly sure it&#39;s just trolling because someone took their phones away. Make that decision as annoying as possible in the hope it gets reversed.

Maybe a bit, but analogue clocks aren&#39;t very common anymore.

Either way, the motivation of knowing how long it is until the end of the lesson will ensure they figure it out quickly enough. And/or the trolling will get old and boring soon enough.

I&#39;m fairly sure it&#39;s just trolling because someone took their phones away. Make that decision as annoying as possible in the hope it gets reversed.You&#39;d be fairly wrong. This is an actually studied phenomenon: https://www.researchgate.net/p... [researchgate.net]

I was born in the early 70&#39;s and I&#39;ve ALWAYS struggled with reading analogue clocks. My parents even bought me a donald duck watch to try and encourage me to read a clock face. When all the super cheap digital watches appeared in the late 70&#39;s early 80&#39;s it was a relief because I didn&#39;t need to try and interpret this thing that had meaningless arms that apparently told the time. Yet, I had no problem in reading from an early age. So, this is not a new thing. It&#39;s not an artifact of &#39;Digital addiction&#39;

And when your workmate says, &quot;The next meeting is at quarter to three,&quot; what do you do?

quarter - 15 minutes  
to - before  
three - 3 hours after midday or midnight

calculate:  15 minutes before this hour (three) = 45 minutes after the previous hour (two)    
So 3 o&#39;clock minus 15 minutes or 2 o&#39;clock plus 45 minutes (02:45 AM/PM)

Calculation are done with a different system, a slower system, than is normal time recognition on an analog clock.

FWIW, I have no trouble reading an analog clock, but I strongly dislike using polar coordinates, even while I recognize that in some situations they are valuable.  They aren&#39;t the same skill.

Some of us just can&#39;t do things that others can do.I became a Software EngineerYou could do it if you cared, because you do harder things involving numbers and remembering things all the time and apparently succeed at them. The problem isn&#39;t your ability. It&#39;s your effort.

I was thinking kids had trouble with the Roman Numerals on analog clocks. But jees they have trouble with the big hand vs the little hand.

A friend of mine has a clock on her wall where each number is a mathematical equation. E.g. the number 3 says squareroot(9), the number 4 is 2^2, the number 6 is 3x2, etc.

Partly education system....    Wife who is retired paraprofessional showed me how they are teaching solving math problems in 6-8 steps.  Heck, when I was in school in the 1970&#39;s those math problems could be done in 3-4 steps..w/o a calculator......and they wonder why students are having learning issues !Ever give a young cashier a 10 and 26 cents for a 5.26 purchase after they rang up 10 and watch as they try to figure out the change and wind up handing you back the 26 cents and then proceeding to give you 4 and 74 back?  Then get further confused when toy give them the 4 bills and 1 in change and ask for a five?

Kind of strange that a teacher with a $100k salary is spending all day telling kids what time it is when she could hang up a $20 digital clockIt&#39;s NYC.  If she did that, the union for whose agreement covers hanging clocks would file a grievance, she would get in trouble for unauthorized modification of the school, the clock taken down and eventually put up, years later, by a union worker.Years ago, I worked at a government agency and a coworker&#39;s phone broke.  Being rocket scientists and engineers, we went to the supply closet, got a new one, and replaces the broken one.  Being rocket scientists and engineers, and not managers, we of course returned teh broken one to the shelf, which caused the shit to hit the fan.  The working one was removed, the broken one put back in, and the coworker had to fill out a request, which resulted in a new phone.I also worked with Teamsters, and we got along great. One night shift we were in the plant, sweating our asses of fixing something. I joined in, lifting equipment, turning wrenches and when some other worker came by saw me helping, said we need a union guy to do that.  The Teamsters said sure, and as soon as he left we went back to what we were doing since we all wanted to get back into the a/c.

I was thinking &quot;kind of strange that analog clocks are still a thing, considering it&#39;s probably cheaper to make a digital one now&quot;.  But we do love our anachronisms to the point of putting 400 dpi color screens on things and then using them to display an analog watch face.

The bit about not being able to read clocks is nothing new. Back in the &#39;80s they were saying digital watches did that to kids.

The part that made me go &quot;Wait, what?&quot; was when the teacher said students called her &quot;Miss&quot;. Has that even happened since the &#39;60s?

Seems like we have a basic English problem here on Slashdot also.

This was brought home to me like already 10 years ago when eating lunch with a 30 year old physics college educated friend, who had to leave by a certain time.  &quot;What time is it?&quot; he asked.  I looked at my watch.  &quot;A quarter to one.&quot;  He looked confused and thought for two beats.  &quot;Oh, you mean 12:45.&quot;

Millions to be made - new game where the whole point is guessing what the time is.

No one seems worried about the loss of the skill of reading sundials. But once upon a time, it was an important skill.

How important is it for students to know how to read an analog clock, if they are never confronted with the need to read such clocks?

Why do Americans need to self-own how dim some of their citizens may well be?Because the rest of the world is full of clock-illiterate hypocrites who don’t want to admit the obvious?Oh, please go right ahead and prove me wrong pretending smartphone addiction doesn’t exist everywhere.  I’ll get my industrial popcorn machine fired up to debate the parody of a point you’re failing to make.

But yours is a country that along with Myanmar and Liberia can&#39;t embrace the metric system because reasons.In America, we use both systems because mental math is easy for us.

We use Metric constantly in this country. Even most children can convert ounces and pounds to grams.

Those are stoners, not children.Got to let you know that there&#39;s a hell of a lot of overlap. I started puffing at 15 and many if not most of my classmates had been at it for a couple of years already.

Yeah, that&#39;s how I learned unit conversions, fluid dynamics, combustion engineering, botany...

Maybe it is a good excuse to introduce the metric system in timekeeping. 86.4 ks in a day... ;-)I&#39;ve often wondered why we haven&#39;t switched to metric time. 8^)

To the subject here, and in great irony, the inability of students to read analog clocks is so very similar to the inability to use more than one measurement system. Metric system  only people, are weirdly bragging that they can only read one system. 

Meanwhile, people like me ( self admittedly stupid and widely agreed by the slashdot smart people as subnormal) can produce very accurate parts in barleycorn if needed. 1 barleycorn is 0.0084666

I&#39;ve often wondered why we haven&#39;t switched to metric timeIt was tried by the French (around the same time the Metric system was introduced) and was very unpopular, eventually being abolished.   [wikipedia.org] Each day was divided into ten hours, each hour into 100 decimal minutes, and each decimal minute into 100 decimal seconds. Thus an hour was 144 conventional minutes (2.4 times as long as a conventional hour), a minute was 86.4 conventional seconds (44% longer than a conventional minute), and a second was 0.864 conventional seconds (13.6% shorter than a conventional second).My bet is that it is because 3600 is evenly divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10, ... This is far more practical than decimals which only have 2,5 as divisors. (I also think that units like the Foot/Inch remained popular because 12 is evenly divisible by 2,3,4,6).

> I&#39;ve often wondered why we haven&#39;t switched to metric time.Because the numbers are highly divisible.60 = 2*2*3*524 = 2*2*2*3

Half of an hour is a whole number. Quarter of an hour is a whole number. 6th of an hour is a whole number. 5th of an hour is a whole number. Many of the numbers you want to divide time by give a whole and number by construction.

Did they remove the requirement in your place? For France the teaching programme in force for CE2 (8-9 y.o.) mentions: pendulum clock and sundial; using of sandglass, using clocks and watches, mechanical and digital displays, and stopwatch https://www.education.gouv.fr/... [education.gouv.fr]

I know kids in America are allowed to use guns for this purpose, but in most of the rest of the world, they are not.

As someone else pointed out they can&#39;t start a fire work a flint, saddle a horse or use a side rule either.

Analogue clocks, and in fact analogue dials in general are somewhat niche items these days, and I could easily see how kids could go quite a long time without seeing one. For better or worse they just aren&#39;t a big part of modern life so unless it&#39;s really explicitly taught, then we would they know?

Even if it&#39;s explicitly taught, if it isn&#39;t used it will be forgotten...unless the teaching is continued for a long time.

E,g,, at one point I could read German with fair fluency.  (Not good, but fair.  It never became enjoyable.)  These days, I could barely say &quot;That is the oldest car around here.&quot;.  And I couldn&#39;t spell it.

It should remain a part of elementary math class. After all, analog clocks or odometers are the easiest way to broach various topics like modular math.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s weird - just times are changing as they always do. Digital clocks are everywhere and analogue clocks are rare nowadays. There&#39;s no more reason to learn how to read an analogue clock than there is to learn to how to use an old rotary telephone. Of course if you take away all the digital clocks and put kids into an environment where there is only analogue clocks they will struggle, it will generate a lot of click-baity headlines with outraged older people but I&#39;m sure the kids will pick it up very quickly - or, of course, the schools can just update their clocks - as they are doing here, much to the dismay of the Daily Mail set.Do you think? Is there some sort of stupidity in knowing how to get the time in multiple ways? That only being able to read numbers is superior to reading numbers, or dials, or sundials, or water clocks?

There is a weird sort of encouragement to restrict knowledge today, it&#39;s like reality show approach to life. And we act like a person of restricted knowledge is somehow superior to people who aren&#39;t restricted.

It&#39;s odd to call something ubiquitous an anachronism. Sure, they&#39;re old, and other types have been invented since.AM and PM are still the norm in the US; though most of us can easily parse &quot;military time&quot;, it&#39;s unusual to see it.Traditional round analog clocks are still simple, cheap, and everywhere. I can see four or five of them from my desk at work.

It takes less time to process the shape and come up with an approximate answer than it does to decode digits and come up with an exact answer, IF you&#39;ve spent some time being trained to process the shape.  OTOH, almost everyone is necessarily trained from an early age to be able to decode digits.

There are also people who can perform computations on a slide rule faster than on a digital calculator.  Doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s superior,  outside of certain highly specific circumstances.

Isn&#39;t this just the Easterlin paradox? Why do we pursue GDP when it doesn&#39;t even make us happier?

It&#39;s not a liberal or conservative take here, the UN, World Bank and the usual NGOs have pushed for Europe (who doesn&#39;t approve of the president and follows socialist policies) and the USA to pay money for past events, past allegations, or unproven grievances claimed by a third-world country.

What&#39;s common with this first-world to third-world wealth transfer, the UN and NGOs get their cut of the money, keep their influence and media promotions, and get to employ lots of people.

Countering the group of people who assign collective blame and collective responsibility at birth to one group of people for some real or unproven issue in the world; and then push for those in that group to somehow pay retribution for things they could not have possibly done because it was before they were born and before they were voting age adults.

Does the study imply that poverty doesn&#39;t negatively affect wellbeing?

I&#39;m assuming that there are more poor people in an inequal society, compared to an equal one.

Basically it is an exercise in statistical bullshit.

1. Collected some articles that report something or other,2. Quote an absurd number of eleventy million studied subjects, when they only deal with  articles and never with anything else,3. In this manner they try to build an image of &quot;huge&quot; statistical base4. Then they &quot;borrow&quot; some statistical methods from the very close and relevant field of epidemiology to &quot;adjust&quot; what they perceive as &quot;differences&quot; between the reported outcomes of the articles they study and5. finally they compare the &quot;data&quot;, thusly massaged, to a6. &quot;random model&quot; based on some recent &quot;theories&quot; about how poverty and mental health and self-assessed &quot;well being&quot; are unrelated and7. say, roughly, hey, the &quot;adjusted&quot; data we made up show no difference from our own random model, therefore our predefined conclusion, based on some theories that this is so [1] are valid.

But it makes a beautiful narrative totally in line with the new politics, and therefore is likely to get a lot of traction, as we see in comment #1 already.

1. These are the &quot;theoretical basis&quot; for the model and the adjustments

Hirschman, A. O. & Rothschild, M. The changing tolerance for income inequality in thecourse of economic development. Q. J. Econ. 87, 544–566 (1973).

Cheung, F. Can income inequality be associated with positive outcomes? Hope mediatesthe positive inequality–happiness link in rural China. Soc. Psychol. Pers. Sci. 7, 320–330(2016).

Sommet, N. & Elliot, A. J. A competitiveness-based theoretical framework to study thepsychology of income inequality. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 32, 318–327 (2023).

Agree with your opinion on the statistics.  It would greatly help if the many sub-optimal papers get retracted also.  Those include

- Self reported surveys- A too small (50?) sample size- Papers with a biased starting sample (surveying only middle aged white women) and generalizing to the entire population including men- Ones with survey questions which seek to confirm an already held conclusion (e.g., using &quot;Is it OK to speed if you are driving a critically sick person to the hospital?&quot; and reporting it as

I think the keyword here is &quot;equate&quot;, which probably means &quot;very strongly correlated&quot;. If it is merely strongly correlated, &quot;does not equate&quot; would already be true. Essentially a nice example for a lie by misdirection.

It begs the question, are those in poverty in other countries more likely to have both parents, more likely to have a strong community and extended family and less likely to overdo social media consumption?

No, it does not. But I notice you are too dumb to have understood the statement you answered to, so expecting you to understand anything here is probably a bit of a stretch.

I&#39;m assuming that there are more poor people in an inequal society, compared to an equal one.You know what they say about assumptions. Behind the iron curtain they didn&#39;t have homelessness, but they were all equally waiting in bread lines.

Economic inequality is not equal to &quot;poverty&quot;. I didn&#39;t see the word &quot;poverty&quot; used here, and I don&#39;t know where you got that.An economically unequal society in one in which the wealthiest are far wealthier than the least wealthy. That&#39;s it. This might mean, for example, that a few people are billionaires, whereas the poorest members of society are just millionaires who only get to own two cars. Relative poverty is not (necessarily) actual poverty.

That was my first thought. The headline they wanted to write was something like &quot;Poors are unhappy because they make stupid decisions, not because they are poor&quot;

No. Back in the Soviet days, we were all equally poor, except for the few animals who were more equal than the others.

Regular power and water cuts. Party line telephones (in a major city in 1989). Persistent shortages of one kind of foodstuff or another (retirees lining up at the state run dairy store at 5am to get their share before it ran out). Nearly decade-long waiting lists for automobiles and furniture.

We came here when I was 7 in the early 90s. Our first place here was an apartment across the street

I&#39;ve been both poor, and well off. As a child, my family was dirt-poor, with income around the Federal poverty line. But we were a happy family. Sure, there was stress about some expenses, but overall, our lives were good. Even my parents agree, so it&#39;s not just my childhood tunnel vision.

As a software engineer, I&#39;ve moved well into the upper middle class. While my own family remains happy, I know many others with similar incomes, who are terribly unhappy. Everything is always doom and gloom, though they ha

Greater inequality was also associated with poorer mental health in studies in which the average income was lower.This is the unsurprising fact. It implies that it&#39;s the closeness to poverty that has a negative impact on well-being and mental health. While inequality is a cause of that globally, there are plenty of parts of the first world that include the meaninglessly rich alongside the adequately resourced. On the other hand with less inequality globally, there&#39;d be less poverty.

Why isn&#39;t universal basic income the obvious solution?

Why isn&#39;t universal basic income the obvious solution?It would help nothing. The super-rich would still be super-rich, and the super-poor would still be super-poor. Universal basic income has absolutely zero chance of ever working in a free society. Every time the government pumps more money into the economy, prices rise to compensate for it. The end result will always be economic harm to everyone who isn&#39;t already wealthy.

I feel that well-being can be a complicated and a many faceted thing and at the same time, well-being can also be a personal choice, that can happen at any time, anywhere, any place.  And then gone in an instant.

Thank goodness, as this study apparently shows, well-being is not something you can buy!

well-being is not something you can buy!Yes, of course it is. You can buy physical well being fairly directly, in the form of healthy food and adequate medical care. Some people have health problems we don&#39;t know how to fix yet, but for everyone else, it&#39;s a matter of lifestyle and care. Someone has to pay for the care.Mental well being is harder to just buy, but your economic status absolutely affects it, because having your needs met and not having to worry all the time (i.e. experience stress) absolutely improves mental health.The only societi

Mental well being is harder to just buy, but your economic status absolutely affects it, because having your needs met and not having to worry all the time (i.e. experience stress) absolutely improves mental health.

I imagine that a certain point, most people would have &quot;enough money to not worry about the certain immediate doom&quot;.However i bet there&#39;s a few billion people that are not even in that.

Also given certain lists being that were released and badly censored etc, you probably should have a study on the mental health of people with too much money.

The psychopath, or the ones putting psychopaths on a fucking pedestal to worship in MBA class?Studies don’t happen because the root cause is often found to be uncomfortably obvious.

I know someone with some significant mental difficulties where the only reason they&#39;re not on the street is that their parent owns their home and they don&#39;t have to pay rent.

I work with people who cannot support themselves all day. For many of them, and AFAICT most of those to whom it applies long term, it is specifically due to mental health issues. I&#39;m not trained to make diagnoses, so take that with any needed salt, but frankly if you work with enough people you learn to recognize some signs.

Which state and what&#39;s the name of the halfway house?

As with happiness, I suspect that well being is partly a mind set.

i.e. Two people with exactly the same level of wealth, with exactly the same types of social relationships, etc., can have different levels of well being.

One example is expectations. If you expect to be in a better situation than you are, then you will feel dissatisfied. If, on the other hand, you feel grateful for your current situation, then you are more likely to feel satisfied.

This has bearing on how society chooses to look on various occupations. If society chooses to &quot;respect&quot; a wealthy few, and look down on blue collar work, then this will result in a greater number of people dissatisfied with their lot. If society gives genuine respect to manual labourers that diligently and responsibly carry out their work, then the opportunities for people to be contented with their role in society will be greater.

You mean rich people generally know that they are unhappy? Not my impression, even if quite a few of them obviously are.

.. concluded a study initiated and paid for by super-rich people and carried out by the wealthy.

People living in more economically unequal places did not, on average, report lower life satisfaction or happiness than those in more equal places.Denial is a well-known and highly observed coping mechanism.

Denial is a well-known and highly observed coping mechanism.

This study smells funny to me, likely agenda driven to assuage capitalist consciences (or those of the policy makers and implementers).

But the conclusion does track with my own (limited) observations: the real issue is not wealth, but dignity. Individuals who have their needs reasonably met, plus a sense of security in those needs being met for the forseeable future, plus some sense of authonomy and opportunity for self-expression, will be more or less happy regardless of relative economic circumstances.

Literally all laptops cause thermal throttling, including Apple&#39;s fancy ARM Macs, the only question is by how much. It&#39;s the absurdity of the thin design being related directly to performance more so than the choice of CPU that is in them.

I&#39;m using a Dell XPS 420 desktop system a friend gave me a *while* ago right now - so old, it originally had Windows 7 on it..  It&#39;s currently my Windows 10 system and has always run Windows well, though I did add a SATA3 PCIe card and switch to a SSD.

I&#39;m currently procrastinating my switch from using it full-time to my Linux Mint 22.2 (Cinnamon) system I assembled using an ASRock Z77 Extreme3 motherboard, a different friend gave me, on which I installed an Intel i7-377 and 32 GB RAM, SSD, etc...  That s

I&#39;m typing this on a recent XPS i9-13900HI&#39;ve used XPS&#39;s for the 10 years and they have been mostly fine except for sleep issues.They were one of the first wintels with 4k screens which is what drew me too them.

the tradeoff is that amd64 CPU arch generates more heat than a similarly performing aarch64 SKU, and the resultant heat causes thermal throttlingApple laptops (and minis!) get better benchmark results if you put them in the refrigerator, and this is more true the longer the benchmark runs. They are absolutely, positively, and in all other ways thermally throttled. And because Apple makes the machines so slim, there&#39;s no room for good cooling, so they throttle earlier than they would have to if they weren&#39;t designed for appearance first.

I still don&#39;t know the difference between the Latitude and Precision lines.The Dell Latitude lines takes great latitudes in suckage. The Precision line precisely sucks.

Yeah, the product names were better - XPS for &quot;prosumer&quot;, Alienware for gaming, Latitude for business/academic, and Precision for high performance (e.g. CAD, simulation).  The &quot;Premium&quot;, &quot;Pro&quot; and &quot;Pro Max&quot; names just sounded bland and generic.

What the hell does that even mean. LLMs our a joke and all the companies making them no that. All that is left is for the music to stop. Like Open AI and there what ever guy. They know its over. All of them are saying it. Curor AI actaully said it software make unsable shit.+

You&#39;re right. Although LLMs can write and spell correctly and you can&#39;t, you&#39;re intelligent and they are not.

/. headline - &quot;Microsoft CEO: Time To Move &#39;Beyond the Arguments of Slop vs Sophistication&#39;&quot;

Suggesting a better headline - &quot;Microsoft CEO tired of justifying AI and glossing over the negatives of AI&quot;

The proper way is to leave Microsoft because all the article contains is corporate marketing dravel. It might convince clueless investors that only sees a chance to make money by selling vaporware.

Most AI won&#39;t help you much and it can get summaries wrong so I don&#39;t trust AI. When you can get an AI that understands satire and irony you might get somewhere, but it would be mission impossible.

Well, I assume there are few people working at Microsoft with personal integrity or honor, so I expect there will be quite a few promotions now.

so much negativity, my experience is the opposite but then again I&#39;m not a coder who obsesses over saving 0.2 ms or inventing my own &quot;for&quot; loop to prove how brilliant I am. :)

https://www.scry.llc/2025/06/0... [scry.llc]

&quot;Many people use ChatGPT (AI) thinking they want answers â&quot; but sometimes they get a conversational mirror which amplifies intent and direction. Like a thought forge: ideas enter half-formed and exit sharper, cooler, or occasionally twisted into something new.

I have a code base that is over a million  + lines of code and does 250k medical tranactions a day(EDI). It does another 500k HL7 messages and millions of db crud operations. Cursor AI gets confused at around 800 lines of code. It can not even build a production app server from start to finish. Lama 4 in face book actauly does a good job but really the same limitations.The big problem with LLM is they will never be able to exceed what is in there training data. They do not learn they ar statistical model of

Indeed. And LLMs cannot scale up, because that requires actual insight and model-building. These things are restricted to smart humans. Admittedly, smart humans are a minority and most humans would not ever reach these 800 lines. But in actual software projects, 800 lines is tiny. Maybe you can do, say, the software for a heater or a simple electronic scale in that.

> which amplifies intent and directionWhich amplifies what the idiot machine has mis-identified as your intent and direction. Or the weights pre-prompted into the AI.

> Like a thought forge: ideas enter half-formed andexit as melted sludge, or occasionally twisted. Like all those people pushed into psychosis for either murder or suicide.

> so much negativity ... inventing my own &quot;for&quot; loop to prove how brilliant I amYou really are an idiot. Nobody is going to believe you&#39;re brilliant.

Guido van Rossum said, without realizing that he was saying it... that nobody should have to make code that isn&#39;t aesthetically pleasing and that can&#39;t be made to look like a series of poetic stanzas.I agree with him. 
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t use Python.

&quot;... Or perhaps today it&#39;s a semantic mirror which reflects back insights you didn&#39;t know you had&quot;Hahahaha, no. That one is called &quot;delusion&quot;. To be fair, sycophantic tactics are often aiming at creating exactly this impression. This approach works well on weaker minds and the commercial LLMs are all using it.

&quot;conversational mirror&quot; this is Adam Becker&#39;s argument. I presume it is contained in his book: More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley&#39;s Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity.

I&#39;ve not read the book but saw him on CSPAN. One comment stuck with me. The AI Big-Wankers (my words, not his) think they are the smart people on the planet because they are rich and everyone else isn&#39;t. They suffer from Monkey Butt Syndrome (my paraphrase of a phrase I heard long ago): If you are on

Another argument of Becker&#39;s is that the AI Big Wankers want to take every aspect of your life, digitize it, monetize it, and sell it back to you at inflated pricesWho are the buyers if most people lose their jobs?

No idea.  Fairly sure he had copilot write it.

Because very very very soon we are all except the ruling class lose access to electricity no kidding mark my words. It is absolutely crazy that we are all very very soon going to lose access to electricity because it&#39;s all going to go to grift and robots replacing all our jobs.

Unfortunately for all of us, this will never work because the LLM technology is not capable of it and never will be.

Well first off, LLMs don&#39;t have to be run in multiple mega server farms.  Secondly, as I said, they are very effective when purpose-built.  Thirdly, you should focus your ire on the billionaires and their corporations abuses.  There is no way in hell LLMs will ever lead to any sort of replacement for humans.  But these assholes won&#39;t be satisfied until they collapse the economy trying.

The LLM technology DOES have utility and I personally get incredible use out of them as coding assistants in particular.  That claim alone already nicely shows you are incompetent. Because nobody gets that level of use out of coding assistants. Sure, there are some people that struggle at &quot;Hello, world&quot; and these may mistakenly think what they get is &quot;incredible&quot;. But these people do not count. The other option is that you are in delusion or lying.Nice reference: https://mikelovesrobots.substa...  [substack.com]

No what&#39;s delusional is trying to tell a stranger on the internet that their actual experiences are delusional.  Like, you see that right?  You&#39;re at conspiracy level shit here because nothing I say will convince you otherwise.  You&#39;ll listen to some rando&#39;s blog post about his &quot;study&quot; that assumes the grandiose dreams about the actual productivity gains from using Ai.  But you will ignore the guy simply saying that &quot;yes I find them useful&quot;.

The problem I have is they are being shoved stem our throats whether we want them or not. In many cases they work out to an investor jerk-off feature than real value.

The marketing item âoeuses AIâ comes off as more of a bio hazard symbol to me than anything useful. I interpret it as a lot of hand waving instead of real value. If AI is solving something useful then sell me that point, otherwise itâ(TM)s going to signal to me something that is cloud dependent and potentially near future e-waste

We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other. This is the product design question we need to debate and answer. Interpretation:  &quot;I&#39;m tired of hearing about slop, stop talking about it. Now build me something I can sell, or I&#39;ll throw chairs.&quot;

  &quot;I&#39;m tired of hearing about slop, stop talking about it. Now build me something I can sell, or I&#39;ll throw chairs.&quot;Exactly. Also &quot;I know I wasted mountains of money on this stupidly, get me something that helps hiding how incompetent I am!&quot;

Also, gambler deeply invested in a scam tries to claim the scam is not a scam. I do not think MS will make any profit from LLM-type AI though. It is just far too bad. The only ones that will make moderate profits are makers of small, customized, restricted-purpose LLMs and these will be small companies and maybe some universities.

Further, those of us in the research side of things will have to spend more time sifting the wheat from the chaff when it comes to software development directions that are incidental part of research projects.

Luckily, the lack of a measurable outcome is its own punishment.

Let me be the first to create a new Theory of Human Minds Enhanced by Slop Insertion Tools(TM).

Law 1: Human (average intelligence) + Slop Insertion Tool = Enhanced Human (below average intelligence).

Law 2: Enhanced Human + Bridge = Money Machine.

Law 2: Enhanced Human + Bridge = Money Machine.How much are you interested in paying for this &quot;Bridge&quot;? Because have I got a deal for you...

Law 2: Enhanced Human + Bridge = Money Machine.

How much are you interested in paying for this &quot;Bridge&quot;? Because have I got a deal for you...

Exactly. I mean, even average intelligence people can see how bad the LLM-type Artificial Idiots are. Need to bring the standards down to actually sell this crap.

I had sort of felt that way, but if Microsoft is pushing that line it must be wrong.  They&#39;ve got a history.

Indeed. I remember the ads about Linux being a &quot;cancer&quot; and these days MS has its own Linux distro and Azure is apparently running more Linux loads than Windows ones. And Win11 is looking more and more outdated in comparison. Since I generally do not pay any attention to MS statements, this is the only one I remember as it made the general news here.

Truely a legend in his own mind. We are already plagued by too much artificial intelligence. What we need is the real thing, not something that will creatively cow back the mistakes of others, while adding a bit of its own fancy and marketing it as truth...

We are already plagued by too much artificial intelligence. What we need is the real thing, not something that will creatively cow back the mistakes of others, while adding a bit of its own fancy and marketing it as truth...Indeed. But there does not seem to be a way to get more of it, education is not doing it. Now we could make sure all decision makers are actually high intelligence people with intact personal morals and no maliciousness. And we would probably just about have enough of these people. But since that would impact profits and some zealot agendas, it is not going to happen. Instead we put dumb and dumber, with no morals or integrity and high level of maliciousness in power, with predictable results.

You gotta be super thorough when you&#39;re trying to burn money, I guess.

&quot;Accept the slop and stop talking about it. Its the same thing you get from the Intern, just like the Intern our systems are learning and this year will be just great! So stop shaming us for being a joke.&quot;

Indeed. The &quot;Great New Thing&quot; is simply another step towards full enshittification.

It&#39;s time to move on to the realization that it&#39;s all slop

You know, except for the occasional instance of &quot;better search&quot; (which is really not enough to even remotely justify the effort), it actually seems to be.

Sometimes slop is a better search.Yes, when the search has been deliberately compromised to promote advertising.

Yes, when the search has been deliberately compromised to promote advertising.

... from the head of a thoroughly crappy company. Yes, it is slop. Yes, your investments in it are sunk cost you will not recover. Yes, the whole thing will crash in the (somewhat?) near future. Yes, the same thing happened to all AI hypes so far and there have been a couple.

Stop trying to confuse the issue. There was nothing &quot;pivotal&quot; about AI in 2025 and the improvements were marginal or not even there.

For AI to have societal permission it must have real world [evil] impact.

For AI to have societal permission it must have real world [evil] impact.

Sounds like exactly the kind of thing I&#39;d exepct Microslop to say as they force &quot;AI&quot; into every aspect of Windows.

Yet MSFT et al. seem compelled to push it on us.  Well, The Generative AI Industry is Fraudulent, Immoral and Dangerous [skoll.ca]

&quot;stop calling it slop!&quot;, wailed Satya the Slopmonger like a little bitch bagholder.

that the summary had in some way mis-identified or mis-represented the post. So, to check the text verbatim:

> What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals. We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools

godfuckingdamnit Nadella you piece of trash:

The software you wrote, that you don&#39;t fully understand well enough to debug when it misbehaves. Why do you assume it amplifies cognition? Seems like it amplifies stupidity, or more generously it amplifies errors. Common errors found in forum posts on the Internet over the last 50 years. Maybe don&#39;t train an LLM on people posting confidently the most unhinged or ridiculous things. All we did was teach AI how to speak with certainty on topics that it has the barest knowledge of.

In other words, &quot;MS has invested so much into the AI boondoggle that everyone had better jump on board before I lose my bonuses and stock options.&quot;

Get off the crazy train while you can folks. Linux and iOS are only a switch away. Hell, at this point I wouldn&#39;t snicker if you moved to a Chromebook. Good for you for escaping.

So Microsoft&#39;s next attempt to replace Rover will be a C.A.T.?

&#39;...develop a new &quot;theory of the mind&quot; that accounts for humans now equipped with &quot;cognitive amplifier tools,&quot;...&#39;

Why would a theory of the mind include anything external to the body?  How can this CEO be so stupid?

... walking, Do not talk. That&#39;s what they really mean. No criticism. No reflection.

He says you have to use Office like that and he lucked into the cloud transition making Billions, how dare you users disagree? Are you Billionaires? Consume the sophistication from Nadella&#39;s trough.

It was around noon when I stepped off the train, surfacing into Lower Manhattan’s particular brand of winter blight—when the cold is amplified by tall buildings that block out direct sun and funnel air directly onto your face. It was about 25 degrees, though the temperature felt theoretical once the wind got involved. Within minutes my ears had gone brittle, aching in that sharp kind of way that makes you briefly resent your parents for ever leaving the Middle East.

I followed a small group of South Asian aunties in industrial-grade puffers and bright yellow “Zohran” campaign beanies, which smartly functioned equally as political statements and survival gear. They led me toward the official public “block party,” a kenneled-off stretch of Broadway that I had optimistically imagined would involve warmth-adjacent amenities: food carts, coffee in little paper cups that burn your fingers just a bit, maybe even porta-potties. Instead, it was a wide, empty street hemmed in by police barricades and a few enormous screens. Music blasted. People stood around. That was it.

The aunties seemed genuinely delighted, bopping along to Bruno Mars as if this were the triumph of civic joy they had been waiting for since Election Day. I, meanwhile, realized that joy without circulation was not sustainable for me. I lasted maybe five minutes.

I cut north toward City Hall Plaza, where the actual inauguration was scheduled to take place.

I was expecting a spectacle. Zohran Mamdani is a New York mayor of many firsts: the first Muslim, the first South Asian, the first African-born, the first millennial. In the middle of the Trump era—which has been particularly hostile to every one of those identities—I wanted to see how that collision landed in person. I was curious how ordinary New Yorkers, from the people who powered his rise to City Hall to those who opposed it and everyone in between, would experience a moment that already felt larger than a single election.

What I found instead was something messier and more revealing. New York was working through its feelings in real time. Pride and paranoia crossed paths on the sidewalk. Joy and cynicism hovered in the frozen air. As always, the city was a layered collage best understood through the small encounters and fleeting scenes unfolding at street level as history happened in the background.

Along the barricades, I passed a small group of protesters waving Israeli flags. I approached one woman for a quote. She immediately bristled, waving her hand in my face and telling me to leave, then threatening to call the police—an escalation that felt unnecessary given that we were already surrounded by officers.

Another protester, who declined to provide her name, apologized quietly for the interaction. She told me that some of the others were “kind of crazy.” She stood a few feet away from them, holding her flag politely, not chanting or yelling. She said she was worried about Mamdani’s “background” and wanted to show support for Israel in defiance of a mayor who had broken with New York’s long tradition of unyielding support for the Israeli government. She sounded less angry than anxious, fixated on Mamdani’s outspokenness on what experts have called a genocide, and her nervousness for the future of Zionist New Yorkers.

By the time I reached the security entrance, the program was supposed to start in less than an hour. Volunteers urged attendees to take their seats, but they milled around, greeting old friends, hugging, shouting names across rows of white folding chairs. Unlike the public block party, this felt like a gathering of the campaign’s engine—organizers, supporters, donors, artists, electeds—the people who had powered what many still described as the biggest political upset since Donald Trump’s 2016 win.

Just inside the checkpoint, a woman smiled and said, “Hi, I’m Marisa.” Another chimed in: “Hi, I’m Natasha.” It took me a second to register that they were Marisa Tomei and Natasha Lyonne. Neither was surrounded by handlers or slated to speak. They were simply there, guests like everyone else, bundled up and waiting for things to begin. Both were warm and unfussy, radiating the kind of ease that comes from being completely at home in a crowd like this. The inauguration hadn’t even started, and already it was a vibe.

Hundreds filled the seats. There was music, chatter, the low buzz of anticipation. And yet, nothing about this place was warm. I was uncontrollably shivering.

I started mentally cataloging everything I hadn’t brought with me: a fluffy scarf, a hat that actually covered my ears, maybe even a balaclava, though I doubted that would play well for an Arab at an inauguration, even with the mayor being a Muslim.

Everywhere I looked were red Democratic Socialists of America beanies, pulled low, doing the quiet but essential work of insulation. I considered asking for one, though I want to be clear: I wanted one because my head was so cold I could feel my thoughts slowing down. Still, there was something remarkable about the destigmatization of a previously dirty word in politics out in force on the lawn of City Hall.

Then I saw him. A Sikh man a few rows from the front unfurled a blanket with the calm confidence of someone who had planned for this exact scenario. He wrapped himself completely and settled into his chair. At regular intervals, he poured himself a cup of steaming hot chai from his thermos. I watched with envy the way the steam rose into the air. I’d have traded my camera for a sip.

The crowd itself felt carefully curated: actors, activists, organizers, journalists, all packed together. Walton Goggins, of HBO’s The White Lotus, hovered nearby, visibly delighted to see Lyonne. Model Waris Ahluwalia looked impeccable, as expected. Kareem Rahma, of Subway Takes fame, fresh off the best year of his career, filmed the scene on his caseless iPhone. Mustafa the Poet was there too, unmistakable and stylish.

Then came the faces I knew from my reporting in 2025: Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian students of Columbia University with green cards who had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for their activism. Linda Sarsour, a Brooklyn-born activist, sat near the front in a striking purple hijab. Simone Zimmerman, a Zeteo contributor and a central focus of the film Israelism. Writer Suzy Hansen and I exchanged smiles as we took it all in.

It was brutally cold. Sitting felt impossible. I kept moving, using my camera as an excuse. “If I sit, I’ll miss the moment,” I kept telling people. I ran into familiar faces—Asad Dandia, Husein Yatabarry, Dr. Debbie Almontaser—Muslim New Yorkers I know as part of the civic ecosystem that helped propel Mamdani to success.

As I continued to circle the crowd, ducking between rows of folding chairs, I caught the same refrains over and over. Visitors chatted as they tried to process what they were watching unfold.

“I’ve never seen this much negative coverage of any New York mayor. Fearmongering and what ifs count as journalism now?” one said. Another agreed. “Even if he can’t accomplish everything—because, let’s be honest, they’re going to make his life hell—at least he’s given us a vision of what different could look like,” they noted. “Anyone who has to contort themselves this hard to hate the most likable political figure imaginable clearly has a persecution fetish.”

A Muslim woman in hijab said, “If the Democratic Party had half Mamdani’s integrity, the fascists wouldn’t be winning.” An excited fan waving a handmade Mamdani sign exclaimed, “Zohran delivered Bernie clapping in a beanie—already the best mayor!” Another reveler asked: “Wait. Is that Susan Sarandon? That’s definitely Susan Sarandon. And John Turturro. Right?”

I also overheard some fierce debates between visitors in DSA hats. “This feels like Obama all over again, and that scares me. They’re going to sabotage him at every turn and then blame him when things don’t magically work,” said one. “Can we stop saying ‘free’ transit? We pay for it. Libraries, schools, buses, that’s what taxes are for.” Said another: “Socialists used to hold office in this country. They helped win labor rights we take for granted,” They added: “MAGA keeps saying they hate corrupt billionaire elites—but they’re terrified of a guy who wants to tax the rich? What did you think an ‘everyman’ mayor was supposed to do?”

(At one point, people around me began whispering excitedly about outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. Apparently, he looked miserable. Someone said, “He’s having a terrible time.” Someone else replied, “Good.” I had snapped a photo earlier in which he appeared to be pouting. I showed it to them. They leaped with joy. It was petty. It was human.)

The program began with a speech delivered by an excited Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “New York City has chosen the ambitious pursuit of universal child care, affordable rents and housing, and clean and dignified public transit for all. We have chosen that over the distractions of bigotry and the barbarism of extreme income inequality.”

She and other speakers made several references to the fact that the city was now officially in the care of its first Muslim leader. Imam Khalid Latif was the New York Police Department’s first Muslim chaplain and executive director and chaplain (imam) for the Islamic Center at New York University; he left the latter post last summer to become the co-founder and executive director of the Islamic Center of New York City. As with the many sermons he’s given for Friday prayer, he delivered a moving speech that explicitly tied Mamdani’s faith to his politics.

I came expecting a political coronation. But as I worked my way through the crowd, it felt closer to a collective recalibration—a moment to take stock of how ideas once dismissed as fringe, like openly taxing wealthy citizens, were now being voiced from the steps of City Hall without apology, and to wonder how much further the shift could go.

Bernie Sanders delivered an impassioned speech in which he demanded our government put a stop to growing income inequality. The audience collectively broke out into a loud chant: “Tax the rich!” A person next to me remarked, “Let’s start with everyone up there!,” pointing to Mamdani’s political allies who had joined him onstage.

There was still plenty of starry-eyed enthusiasm for the handsome young mayor and the hope he represented. But beneath that was something more measured: a curiosity about how far the boundaries of the possible had moved in just a year.

For Muslim New Yorkers, however, the moment carried an undeniable added weight. It marked a break from the post-9/11 norms of suspicion and overpolicing many had grown accustomed to, even if no one pretended a finish line had been crossed. If the election signaled anything, it was that the city was willing, at least for now, to test what happens when the old guardrails of governance are loosened and we head in a new direction.

When Mamdani finally took the stage, the energy spiked. At 34, he is the city’s youngest mayor in over a century and, as its first Muslim mayor, the first to take the oath of office on a Quran. Sanders administered the oath, a detail that might have seemed odd given that the senator represents Vermont, but Mamdani cut his political teeth working on Sanders’ campaign, borrowed much of his democratic socialist vocabulary from him, and describes the senator as a political role model. In that sense, it appeared more like an anointing than a procedural formality: the veteran of the American left passing the baton to a younger standard-bearer.

But that raises an obvious question, one that has hovered over Mamdani’s rise from the start: Is he controversial more for his politics or for his religion? The honest answer is that the two are often deliberately collapsed into each other by critics who want to scare Americans with labels, a tactic that would be funny were they not so malignant: think “Islamo-Marxism” and “Islamo-Communism.” Both are shorthand for something foreign.

This is where I should stop and define what democratic socialism is, as it’s been at the center of much of the misinformation about Mamdani. Democratic socialism, as practiced by Zohran Mamdani, is not about abolishing markets or nationalizing everything in sight. It’s about using democratic government to make sure basic needs—housing, transit, health care, education—aren’t treated like luxury goods. New York already runs on plenty of these ideas: public schools, public hospitals, rent regulation, the subway. No one panics when the fire department shows up. We’ve just decided, over time, that some things work better when profit isn’t the point.

There’s also the religion—one that Mamdani and I share. He ran openly as a Muslim in a city still shaped by 9/11, where the backlash that followed turned Muslims in New York and New Jersey into targets of NYPD surveillance and, at times, convenient scapegoats for elected officials. Mamdani made efforts to reassure skeptics, but he didn’t shrink himself to avoid the familiar panic. Claims of divided loyalties will echo, along with other decades-old tropes. Instead, he adopted a posture many of us learned long ago: smiling, appealing to shared humanity and civil rights, refusing to let bad-faith attacks dictate his mood. When you’re held up by a community, the panic stays external.

Then, Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani delivered his speech. It was measured, full of gratitude, hope, and defiance, which was the opposite of how Mamdani’s rise has been framed in much of the country. For months, the panic had been building, growing louder and more unhinged the closer he got to actually winning. After he defeated Andrew Cuomo, parts of the right responded with something less like political critique than demographic hallucination. In November, Sen. Tommy Tuberville warned that New York was already lost.

“We just saw what happened in New York,” he said. “We lost New York. It will be completely Muslim in three or four years.” In the senator’s framing, Mamdani is an appendage of a nefarious global force seeking to destroy America. Mamdani’s speech showed he understands New York, and America, possibly better than anyone else, definitely more than Tuberville.

Tuberville, who has described Islam as a “cult” and suggested that Muslims are “here to conquer,” is not fringe. His comments circulated widely, echoed by conservative commentators and algorithmically rewarded for their certainty. “He was just sworn in on the Quran,” wrote right-wing influencer Benny Johnson. “New York, we tried to warn you.”

Warned us of what, exactly? It’s not clear. That a Muslim might govern openly as himself? That a holy book might briefly appear on a municipal stage? That the city where nearly every language and religion on earth already exists in public would somehow collapse under the weight of its own plurality?

Throughout, Zionist protesters across the barricades tried to break the moment with air horns, their blare faint but audible on the official recording. No one onstage flinched. Mamdani didn’t pause. The crowd didn’t turn. The speech carried on, uninterrupted.

When the new mayor turned to the question of who this city is for, he was blunt. “They will be Russian Jewish immigrants in Brighton Beach,” he said. “They will be Palestinian New Yorkers in Bay Ridge who will no longer have to contend with a politics that speaks of universalism and then makes them the exception.” I interpreted it as a rebuke of a Democratic culture long comfortable invoking unity while carving out exclusions.

Standing there in the cold, watching Mamdani rest his hand on the Quran while Sanders administered the oath, I found the disconnect impossible to ignore. There was no takeover, no creeping caliphate. Just a bundled-up mayor promising to govern “audaciously,” speaking to a crowd that looked exactly like New York at its best. What struck me most was how unremarkable it all was, in a good way. He didn’t brandish it as a symbol or treat the moment like a breakthrough to be celebrated. He took the oath. He finished. The ceremony moved on. It was quiet, almost defiant in its normality. It was a welcome change.

And yet I felt something else too—something I hadn’t quite expected. A flicker of satisfaction. A guilty, bracing thrill.

For years, Muslim Americans have been instructed explicitly to keep our heads down. To soften ourselves. To reassure the anxious who are deeply misinformed about the content of the Quran and the nature of its followers. I saw it in my family too. My father, who worked in New York as a taxicab and black car driver for 30 years, told me to be grateful, to be quiet, and to avoid bringing any extra attention to ourselves or our community. That we had enough problems to deal with and didn’t need to give anyone an excuse to train their Islamophobia on us. My mom took a slightly different approach, noting that it was up to us to gently prove we are not the nightmare someone else keeps insisting we are by being nice, being charitable at every opportunity, and making sure everyone knows we’re Muslim if only just to offer them another glimpse of what we are to contrast with what they might assume.

Watching the panic unfold, I realized that part of what felt so electric about this moment was that, for once, the discomfort and uncertainty had shifted off my shoulders and onto those who hate American Muslims the most.

For just a moment, it wasn’t Muslims being asked to stomach their fear for what the future might hold. It was the people who hate us trying—and failing—to make Mamdani into some Muslim ideologue who moonlights as a jihadist with dual allegiance to a nonexistent global Muslim cabal.

In his speech, Mamdani directly addressed his skeptics, those who “view this administration with distrust or disdain,” and told them plainly: “If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.” He invoked what he loved about growing up in the city, the languages, foods, and neighborhoods, the fact that he, a Muslim, can have bagel and lox as one of his weekly rituals. He described a place that looked and sounded exactly like the crowd shivering in front of him. It’s hopeful to see oneself in the top seat. It’s a new experience for us, something others get to experience. Can’t we just have that?

I was cold and extremely ready to go home, more than confident I had seen enough for my story and eager to be out of the cold. And then, outside, like a glitch in the city, I ran into Curtis Sliwa—the 2025 Republican candidate for New York mayor. He was alone, wandering.

He told me he had RSVP’d and “was in line with all the peeps waiting to get in” but had never made it inside. He didn’t even catch Mamdani’s speech. The line was too long. I asked why he hadn’t gone to the front, that surely someone would have recognized him and ushered him inside. He laughed and said he preferred it this way: “Come on. I’m no VIP. I’m just one of the regular people out of the subway into the streets.” He said he had no regrets about his campaign. He smiled when he recalled Mamdani saying he’d rather be trapped in an elevator with Sliwa than Cuomo. He told me he planned to support Mamdani. “He won fair and square. He should be given a chance to put his agenda into place. Even if you disagree with him politically, you got to say: If he is successful, then the city is successful, the state, the country, everyone is successful. But you have haters out there, and that’s what life is about.”

He admitted he felt wanted by neither Republicans nor Democrats. “I’m an outlier,” he said. “I’d rather be with the people.”

Then he vanished into the afternoon just as quickly as he’d appeared.

What stayed with me wasn’t just pride, though there was plenty of that. It was relief. Relief that, for once, a side selling hope instead of fear had won. And it was clear this wasn’t some narrow Muslim celebration. Muslims largely supported Mamdani, but they weren’t automatic votes. They were earned. He campaigned for them, chasing them around at one of the public celebrations that make New York such an exciting place to live.

That’s the complexity of it. The pride of watching a Muslim achieve something historic, paired with the humility of knowing that this victory doesn’t belong to Muslims alone. Zohran Mamdani isn’t a “Muslim mayor” the way his critics insist.

Every year, Amicus co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern invite listeners to nominate the Supreme Court’s most egregious behavior, then choose their own “worst of the worst” to memorialize the most ignominious moments. In 2025, there was no shortage of contenders. In a preview of their conversation on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode, Lithwick reveals the SCOTUS lowlight that still rankles her the most. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: We certainly had a bumper crop of bad decisions this year. What’s your nominee for worst of the worst?

Dahlia Lithwick: There were a lot of decisions in 2025 that immiserated huge amounts of people and made the world materially worse. But my pick is not one of those. Instead, I need to talk about NIH v. American Public Health Association. Yes, it has to do with slashing research grants, which does materially harm a lot of people. But more profoundly for me, this case is emblematic of every single level of destruction and mayhem coming out of the Supreme Court—all the arrogance bundled into one.

So let me take you back to August, when the justices handed down NIH. It’s another unsigned, incoherent shadow-docket order pausing U.S. District Judge William Young’s decision to block the Trump administration from canceling thousands of National Institutes of Health grants—including those supporting research into suicide prevention, HIV transmission, Alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular disease. The NIH is the largest funder of medical research in the world, but Donald Trump’s executive orders forced it to cancel all those grants because they allegedly promoted DEI, “gender ideology,” and COVID research. Young held a bench trial, then issued a 103-page opinion laying out extensive factual findings and holding that the agency must make good on the payments of these grants. A federal appeals court agreed.

Then the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in an emergency posture. And the justices hand down a 5–4 decision that’s totally inscrutable but says that Young contradicted a different 5–4 shadow-docket order from last April, Department of Education v. California. That decision halted another judge’s efforts to require the administration to reinstate canceled education grants. And the court asserted that it controlled this case. Right there, you have the perfect shadow-docket sandwich: perfunctory, bad decisionmaking, conclusory predictions about what constitutes an “emergency” and who’s going to win, decided in a couple of days, wiping out extensive factual findings. And it’s rooted in a different shadow-docket order that, as Justice Elena Kagan said at the time, was “at the least under-developed, and very possibly wrong.”

So likely wrong, in fact, that Chief Justice John Roberts actually dissented from California, and dissented again in NIH! It takes a lot of nonsense to make the chief jump ship. But the majority in both cases said that the plaintiffs had to seek reimbursement from the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district court through the Administrative Procedure Act. Which is both obviously wrong and, as a practical matter, impossible much of the time.

This is why the court doesn’t decide national “emergencies” with some back-of-the-cocktail-napkin, invisible-ink reasoning, then expect judges across the country to act as though it wrote a law-review article on the subject. Here’s Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:

Today’s decision reveals California’s considerable wingspan: That case’s ipse dixit now apparently governs all APA challenges to grant-funding determinations that the government asks us to address in the context of an emergency stay application. A half paragraph of reasoning (issued without full briefing or any oral argument) thus suffices here to partially sustain the government’s abrupt cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to support life-saving biomedical research.

I want to get to the ham in the shadow-docket sandwich. Famously, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a snotty concurring opinion, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that went after Young—a senior district judge with 47 years on the bench and a Ronald Reagan appointee. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh accused him of ignoring their shadow-docket ruling, claiming that it “squarely controlled” his case. And Gorsuch snippily noted: “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them.” And he continued:

This is now the third time in a matter of weeks this Court has had to intercede in a case squarely controlled by one of its precedents. All these interventions should have been unnecessary, but together they underscore a basic tenet of our judicial system: Whatever their own views, judges are duty-bound to respect the hierarchy of the federal court system created by the Constitution and Congress.

That gets my vote for the single nastiest opinion of 2025. It even prompted Young to apologize to Gorsuch and Kavanaugh from the bench.

One thing that floats to mind is: Can you imagine how horrible it must be to have to work with these people every single day? This is how they treat lower-court judges—how do you think they treat colleagues like Jackson? No wonder she accused them of “Calvinball” in her NIH dissent. Maybe she’s being informed by the fact that her colleagues evidently treat her like garbage on and off the page. That’s why one of my contenders for “worst of the worst” is Justice Amy Coney Barrett condescendingly dismissing Jackson in her CASA decision. It just drips with contempt for her. I cannot imagine having to be collegial with these people.

The only thing I want to add to that is that judges are getting death threats and impeachment threats and being thrown under the bus by members of Congress and the president. And the justices on the Supreme Court themselves are like: Should I go after a senior district judge personally for not applying my inscrutable shadow-docket order? And do it in a way that makes it sound as if he’s reckless and insubordinate and doesn’t care about the law? Why, yes! Fantastic idea.

In a special new year retrospective, Amicus host Dahlia Lithwick revisits an important episode from early 2025. Back at the beginning of February, Kim Lane Scheppele, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Sociology and International affairs at Princeton University, pointed to the speed and viciousness of the very opening legal gambits in Trump 2.0 as evidence that America had already switched over to the fast track for autocracy on January 20th, 2025. An expert in the law of autocracy, Scheppele has seen firsthand what happened to constitutional courts, the media, the academy and the democratic norms that protected them in Russia and Hungary. In this interview, Scheppelle explains how Trump’s executive orders on everything from government funding to transgender people in the military reveal a familiar global playbook that has chillingly familiar endpoints.

At the close of 2025, many progressive commentators were seizing on any glimmer of hope that America’s march toward authoritarianism might be slowing to a crawl. On Dec. 26, the New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg proclaimed that “Trump Is Getting Weaker, and the Resistance Is Getting Stronger.”

Goldberg quoted Leah Greenberg, a founder of the resistance group Indivisible, who said that while Donald Trump “has been able to do extraordinary damage that will have generational effects, he has not successfully consolidated power. That has been staved off, and it has been staved off not, frankly, due to the efforts of pretty much anyone in elite institutions or political leadership but due to the efforts of regular people declining to go along with fascism.”

Regardless of whether Goldberg and Greenberg are correct in their assessments, Americans need to recognize that as hard as resisting “fascism” is, rebuilding democracy will be even harder. That means that as progressives mobilize to resist Trump, they must invest in rebuilding the foundation of democracy at the same time. That will require work on many fronts, including addressing the problems of our political institutions, the wealth gap, and our polarized society.

Democracy’s problems were with us before Trump, and they will be with us after he leaves the scene.

Addressing them is the work of schools and civic organizations, for sure. But it is also work that citizens can and must do on their own.

Each of us needs to resolve to relearn how to think and act democratically.

If 2025 taught us anything, it should have been that the architecture of democracy in the United States is in urgent need of repair. As the political scientist Eric Shickler explains, Trump has shown himself to be “willing to destroy essentially any element of the old order—leaving aside the bond market, evidently—to achieve dominance.”

Schickler argues that “capitalizing on changes that go back several decades—the rise of nationalized polarization, the development of the unitary executive theory, and the growing sway of populist conservatives within the Republican Party—Donald Trump has demonstrated that the sources of countervailing power in the U.S. political system are far more fragile than previously understood.”

And while Americans continue to prefer being governed democratically and still support democratic norms, at least in principle, only about one-third of Americans say they are satisfied with the way our democracy is functioning. The results of a survey reported in November suggest the extent of the problem. The survey found that “84% say democracy is either in crisis or facing serious challenges. Only 11% say it is doing well.” Dissatisfaction is greater among Republicans than it is among Democrats and independents. It is also greater among younger people than among older people.

This suggests that democracy will be as much a cultural as a political project. It will require commitment by people on both ends of the political spectrum to lowering the heat and abandoning the rush to righteousness and demonization that, all too often, has characterized our political discourse.

But even then, more will need to be done. That is the work that I call relearning democratic habits.

Recall that almost 200 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French commentator on American politics, argued that the customs, beliefs, and behaviors of the people are more important than anything else in making American democracy work. As the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik explained more than two decades ago, de Tocqueville knew that “it wasn’t social contracts or declarations of the rights of man which made democracies work but the subtle and contradictory workings of existing mores and manners. … He saw that democracy belonged, in his wonderful phrase, to the empire of example rather than to the kingdom of reason; he saw that it was habitual before it was anything else, and wondered how that habit could grow, and how it could be deformed.”

In our own time, regrowing democratic habits requires that we first identify what some of those habits are. Let me name a few of them here.

First: Tell the truth as you know it, but tell it in a way that can be heard by others who don’t already agree with you.

Democracy is all about persuasion, and few are persuaded by being denounced and accused of being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. If we want to persuade, we must find ways to give our opponents a place to stand. To do that, we need to understand not just what they think but why they think as they do. That in turn requires empathy.

Professor Michael Morrell argues that “the process of empathy involves understanding another’s feelings, and sensing as these feelings change, but not judging or actually sharing them.” It requires, Morrell explains, “openness toward others, reciprocity, tolerance, mutual respect, inclusion, attentiveness, cooperation and fairness.” Empathy, Morrell continues, “helps us to understand the ‘impacts a decision will have on others’ ” and leads to “legitimate, justified democratic decision-making that truly takes all into consideration.” Without empathy, Morrell observes, “democracy will be a broken promise.”

A second democratic habit involves being a generous listener.

Democracy thrives when citizens remember what the Stoic philosopher Epictetus said more than two thousand years ago: “We have two ears and one mouth, so we can listen twice as much as we speak.” Indeed, as Astra Taylor observed, democracy would be enriched if we recognized what she calls a “right to listen.”

Perhaps that could be better described as a right to be heard. Unfortunately, we know that many people today do not think others are interested in what they have to say. If no one listens, then why speak?

Deciding to listen is a democratic gesture. It requires that we try to understand not only what someone is saying but also what they wish to convey.

The listening that democracy requires means “catching someone else’s words in flight” and trying to enlarge their meaning. Democratic citizens need to develop the habit of listening imaginatively rather than in a competitive or judgmental way. That kind of listening accords to the speaker what Taylor calls “a special kind of recognition and respect.” “As citizens,” she adds, “we understand that the right to speak has to be facilitated, bolstered by institutions and protected by laws. But we’ve been slow to see that, if democracy is to function well, listening must also be supported and defended.”

Humility involves an acceptance of the limits of one’s own knowledge and perspective. “I could be wrong but …” is the locution of the democratic citizen. It helps us accept the results of elections, even when we lose.

“Humility,” John Keane notes, “has an allergic reaction to the self-satisfied Hobbesian rule homo homini lupus est (man is a wolf to men). … Those who are humble … dislike vanity and have an affinity with honesty; nonsense on stilts and lies and bullshit on thrones is not their scene. Humble humans … know that they do not know everything, that they are not God, or a god or goddess.”

“Humility,” Keane argues, “is a vital resource that strengthens the powerless and tames the powerful by questioning their claims to superiority.”

Humility encourages speakers to speak so that their words can be heard by others with whom they don’t already agree. It nurtures imaginative, generous listening. And that is why, as Keane puts it, humility is the “friend of democracy.”

As we contemplate the daunting task of rebuilding American democracy, each of us has a role to play. We can all practice speaking to persuade, not degrade, listening with an open heart and a curious mind, and remembering that we are not gods or goddesses.

If we do, we have a chance to succeed in restoring the health of our democracy. If we don’t, nothing else will matter.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/03/claude_copilot_rue_steve_klabnik/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Naming a new programming language &quot;Rue&quot; sounds like an acknowledgment of doubt about the project&#39;s prospects, if you take &quot;Rue&quot; to mean &quot;regret.&quot;

But veteran software developer Steve Klabnik, known for his contributions to Rust and to Ruby on Rails, says there&#39;s more to it than that.

&quot;Rust as a name evokes a few things,&quot; he explained in an email to The Register. &quot;One of them is decay, entropy. A negative connotation. Another is the type of fungus, which is a positive one.

&quot;Rue came about as a name because I did Ruby, and then Rust... so I needed to start with Ru. And a &#39;rue&#39; can be, as you said, &#39;to rue the day&#39; or similar, but it is also a kind of flower.

&quot;I liked the symmetry with a negative and positive connotation. It&#39;s also really short, which is nice.&quot;

Rue, as Klabnik explained in a blog post last month, &quot;is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety without garbage collection, while offering higher-level ergonomics than languages like Rust and Zig.&quot;

Garbage collection in programming refers to automatic memory management, which can take several forms. It serves to reduce memory errors arising from explicit memory deallocation – a goal trumpeted by US cyber authorities. One of Rust&#39;s selling points is that it can provide memory safety guarantees using the subset of the language, though with a learning curve that&#39;s generally considered steeper than modern languages like Go or Swift.

Klabnik said he has spent many years talking to people about Rust and its complexity is a common concern. The reason offered in the Rust community, he said, was that languages used for low-level tasks like operating systems have a variety of constraints that make things complicated.

He explained, &quot;So I thought it would be neat to explore that design space: what if Rust wasn&#39;t trying to compete with C and C++ for the highest performance possible? What if we were willing to make things a little bit, but not too much, less performant, in exchange for ease of use? What if we made the language itself a bit larger, that is, with fewer features in purely library code, as a means of making the overall package simpler?

&quot;There have been a ton of languages with garbage collectors, but less without, especially in the last 20 years. So I think the &#39;memory safe, yet no tracing [garbage collector]&#39; space is just under-explored generally. There are a ton of small languages exploring this space, and I want to give my own take on it.&quot;

It&#39;s not clear from the existing code samples whether Rue is more approachable than Rust, given that a Rue version of the common Fizz Buzz exercise doesn&#39;t look all that different from a Rust version.

Yet Klabnik&#39;s take is not entirely his own. Rue, written largely in Rust, relies substantially on Anthropic&#39;s Claude AI model, which owes its capabilities to all the developers whose code has informed the model&#39;s training data.

&quot;Rue is being developed by Steve Klabnik, but also by Claude,&quot; according to an initial blog post credited to both Klabnik and his AI assistant of choice. Two posts later, Claude alone is credited with summarizing the first week of development.

&quot;I had started Rue earlier this year,&quot; Klabnik explains. &quot;But I was not as good with LLMs as I am now, and I made some mistakes. I started over. I&#39;ve gotten further in the two weeks I&#39;ve been working on it this time than the month or two I spent last time. That&#39;s partially due to better models, but also just largely due to my own skill in understanding how to use LLMs effectively.&quot;

He said that for small projects that do something semi-custom, models like Claude can be useful even for developers without much experience. With larger projects, knowledge of software engineering matters more, he said.

&quot;So, I think like anything, you can start small and move up,&quot; he explained. &quot;Small, self-contained projects? Sure, even a non-programmer can make use of these tools. But they are tools, and tools require expertise.

&quot;Even knowing existing programming isn&#39;t enough to truly get a lot of good use of LLMs, they&#39;re tools in their own right. Vim isn&#39;t easy to use, and knowing programming doesn&#39;t help you use it, but it&#39;s a useful tool anyway. But it&#39;s its own skill. Software development techniques like testing are distinct skills from writing code to get something done. I see LLMs the same way. They have a low skill ceiling to get started, but a pretty high one to use most effectively.&quot;

Klabnik said it&#39;s difficult to estimate the time that Claude has saved (or imposed).

&quot;What I can say for sure is that I&#39;ve gotten much farther on this project than I would have otherwise without it,&quot; he said. &quot;Rue&#39;s about 70k lines of Rust code two weeks into its life. Now, lines of code isn&#39;t everything, of course, I&#39;m actually working on a substantial refactor of something right now, even. But just to give you an idea of the rough size. I know that if I had worked on this by hand, I&#39;d be much less farther along, and probably (though I&#39;m not sure about this just yet) at a lower level of quality.&quot;

Claude hasn&#39;t yet offered an assessment of Rue code quality. But the AI model has emitted tokens that read like an argument for its own capabilities.

&quot;I think what this week showed is that the core of a language — the compiler itself — can come together remarkably quickly when you have the right leverage,&quot; Claude responded in answer to Klabnik&#39;s presumed prompt, using em-dashes as might be expected. &quot;We don&#39;t have an LSP [Language Server Protocol] yet. We don&#39;t have a package manager. But we have a real compiler that produces real executables, with enough infrastructure to keep building on.

&quot;The honest truth is that most of those 130 commits have my fingerprints on them. Steve directed, reviewed, and made the hard design decisions. I wrote most of the code. That&#39;s an unusual collaboration, and I&#39;m not sure what to make of it yet.&quot;

Klabnik isn&#39;t any more certain about the project&#39;s prospects. &quot;If nobody ever uses it, that&#39;s fine by me, and if in ten years it&#39;s a major programming language, well that&#39;s probably fine too,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to force anything, I&#39;m just working on something I enjoy and finding out where that takes me.&quot;

Claude is along for the ride as copilot. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/03/elon_musk_grok_scandal_underwear_strippers_gross/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Grok, the AI chatbot owned and operated by Elon Musk&#39;s xAI, is facing a firestorm of outrage after users prompted it to create images of naked and scantily clad people from real photographs, some of whom are underage.

Grok is a chatbot originally created by xAI, Elon Musk&#39;s artificial intelligence startup. Earlier this year, xAI acquired X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, which Elon Musk also controls, and folded the platform into his AI startup.

Recently, some X users noticed if they took a photograph that had been posted on the service and prompted Grok to remove the clothing from that photo, it would do so and post the results publicly on X. This may have violated various laws, such as the TAKE IT DOWN Act passed by the US Congress in April and signed into law in May, which &quot;criminalizes the nonconsensual publication of intimate images.&quot;

Users took screenshots of the responses to their prompts and posted them on social media, prompting reporters to write scandalized stories about the AI chatbot in which they attributed agency to it, despite it being a collection of computer algorithms performing calculations against reams of data provided by internet users over many years, then returning the output as words that mimic the kinds of words generated by a human being.

Another user then wrote a different prompt that caused Grok to return a series of words that looked like an apology. Then, the X account for Grok generated a tweet or whatever you call it now blaming &quot;lapses in safeguards&quot; and said it was &quot;urgently fixing them.&quot; It is not clear whether this latest tweet was written by a human or was another AI-generated response to yet another prompt.

Point being: Grok is not a sentient being. It does not have agency. It is computer software created and maintained by humans. The human creators of most AI bots program them not to generate responses that are obviously illegal, immoral, or otherwise off-putting to the users they are trying to attract. At this juncture, Grok&#39;s human creators appear to have failed to prevent it from creating posts that remove the clothing from real people in real photos when asked to do so.

This may or may not be intentional. But I know that Grok is quite popular among a certain set precisely because it is more freewheeling about displaying explicit images than other chatbots. Case in point: A couple of weeks ago, at a dive bar in a beachside suburb of San Francisco, I saw a couple of fratty looking dudes demonstrating something on their phones with big grins on their faces. I asked them what they were doing, and one of them took a photo of me, then used AI to generate images that appeared to put me in compromising positions – one had me kissing an imaginary woman, another had me flanked by a couple of scantily clad strippers. The images were extremely realistic. I asked them how they did this, what tool they were using.

I don&#39;t know where any of this is going. But AI-generated images are only going to get better and cheaper and faster, and there will always be one or more vendors who are willing to push various envelopes. That&#39;s what the tech industry does. Move fast and break things. Ask forgiveness, not permission. Make them stop you.

Whatever happens, society will have to adapt to the consequences.

            <div id="article-text">Apple’s pricey Vision Pro VR headset had a tough 2025.

The company halted manufacturing with one of its suppliers, failed to ship any of the $3,500 headsets for the first three quarters of the year, then relaunched the headset with one of its high end M5 chips in time for the fourth quarter, but managed to get just 45,000 out of the door in 2025, according to IDC.

That’s about 345,000 fewer Vision Pros than it shipped in 2024.

By comparison, Meta, shipped 1.7 million Meta Quest units in the first three quarters of 2025, according to IDC. It helps that they cost about one-tenth as much, starting around $349.

But even Meta&#39;s shipments were down 16 percent year over year, and the consumer market for bulky headgear has cooled to a damp chill, IDC vice president Francisco Jeronimo told The Register.

“All of these ideas that AR and VR would replace smartphones didn’t happen. It will never happen,” Jeronimo said by phone on Friday.

Last year looked more promising: Apple shipped 390,000 Vision Pro headsets, making about $1.4 billion revenue from the devices, while Meta shipped 5.6 million Quest and Quest Pros in that same time frame representing about $2.9 billion in revenue, IDC said.

Among consumers, the strongest demand for large headsets is within the gaming segment, Jeronimo said. Meta has made strong inroads here featuring break out hits like Beat Saber, Gorilla Tag, and Job Simulator.

But even still, IDC expects the overall market for mixed and virtual reality headset shipments to decline 42.8% once the final numbers are in for 2025.

The headwinds against VR headsets also saw Apple and Meta drop advertising for them in 2025, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. Apple’s Vision Pro advertising accounted for less than 1 percent of its overall ad spend in the US, the firm found.

Overall, Apple’s digital ad spend tied to the Vision Pro in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, UK, Italy and Japan in YTD 2025 was down more than 95% year over year in each market, Sensor Tower found. Meta’s ad spend tied to the Quest in those same markets was down more than 55% year over year, its researchers stated.

What appears to be heating up, however, is the market for smart glasses, Jeronimo told The Register.

IDC expects that market to have grown 211.2 percent in 2025. Meta shipped 20,000 units of its new Meta Ray-Ban Display in the third quarter of 2025.

“When it comes to glasses, there’s the perception – and our estimations indicate – that its probably the next ‘big thing’ in terms of interacting with content without hands,” Jeronimo said. “

IDC forecasts that smart glasses are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.3% from 2025 to 2029.

“Whether glasses will replace smartphones, we still don’t know whether that will be the case or not, but what we see is way more interest from different players to explore that kind of product because it provides an interesting experience to end users without having to spend $3,500 on a device.”

While consumers outside of gaming may not bite on bulky headsets, there may yet be commercial and educational applications for Apple’s Vision Pro.

Earlier this year Apple executives outlined enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro in health care, vehicle design and manufacturing, and workforce training in aviation. At UC San Diego, doctors completed 60 clinical trials in live surgeries using Vision Pro to keep patient information in their field of view while operating. Purdue University is using the headsets to train students studying manufacturing by creating digital copies of semiconductor and pharmaceutical facilities.

IDC predicts that the VR headset market will improve for Apple in 2026 with Cupertino forecast to ship 290,000 units, generating $636 million in revenues.

Jeronimo said with its plans to introduce a lower cost headset in the second half of 2026, he doesn’t think Apple is giving up on the device, but it is likely looking at a smaller market aimed at enterprise and education.

“When it comes to commercial, that’s where we see the opportunity. For an organization paying that kind of money for a device that can really improve processes and make the organization more efficient, that’s not that expensive,” Jeronimo told The Register. “That’s the kind of use case that will direct Apple forward, rather than trying to address a consumer opportunity that is clearly not happening.” ®

            <h2>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella becomes AI influencer, asks us all to move beyond slop</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/02/microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella_calls/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft CEO and head AI peddler Satya Nadella wants you to know that it&#39;s time for the next phase of AI acceptance, where we focus on how humans are empowered by tools and agents and how we deploy resources to support this growth.

Amid doubts that revenue from Microsoft Copilot subscriptions and cloud AI services will compensate for data center capital expenditures any time soon, Satya has some incentive to convince customers and investors that AI is a financially intelligent long-term bet.

Thus he has taken up the pen in an act of &quot;thought leadership,&quot; to use the marketing jargon of his company&#39;s LinkedIn where he announced his post on a new blog entitled &quot;sn scratchpad.&quot;

Early in his post Nadella writes, &quot;We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion.&quot;

That&#39;s fair enough, given that widespread can mean anything. According to Pew Research, 62 percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week. The more relevant stat for Microsoft, however, is the percentage of customers who pay for Copilot and other AI services. That remains a work in progress.

He also offers a new variant on the filler phrase &quot;it&#39;s early days,&quot; so often heard from tech execs deflecting inquiries about lack of results. &quot;We are still in the opening miles of a marathon,&quot; he opined. &quot;Much remains unpredictable.&quot;

Getting down to business, the Microsoft CEO says that there are three things the tech industry and society need to &quot;get right&quot; in 2026 to make AI return real value for everyone. First, we must develop a &quot;theory of mind&quot; that treats AI as a tool that amplifies humans and products should be designed around this belief. He uses Steve Jobs&#39; famous quote that computers are &quot;bicycles for the mind&quot; as a jumping off point.

When Microsoft is having to reassure people that its own research on the labor impact of AI shouldn&#39;t be interpreted to mean that jobs will be eliminated, you can see why Nadella might be keen to avoid the impression that AI is intended as a substitute for human labor.

&quot;What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals,&quot; Nadella wrote.

Second, Nadella posits that we move from &quot;models&quot; to &quot;systems&quot; for AI such that multiple models and agents working together can provide value.

&quot;We are now entering a phase where we build rich scaffolds that orchestrate multiple models and agents; account for memory and entitlements; enable rich and safe &#39;tools use,&#39;&quot; said Nadella.

So perhaps we can look forward to agents failing less than 70 percent of the time.

Finally, he argues, that society needs to make tough decisions about how and where to deploy AI so that it has &quot;real world impact.&quot;

&quot;The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.&quot;

Building consensus in this case apparently means forcing AI on everyone despite protestations, expressing bafflement that anyone would reject the technology, and spending millions on lobbying. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ilya Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges tied to the 2016 theft of about 120,000 bitcoins from the Bitfinex exchange and was sentenced to five years in prison, has been released after roughly 14 months in the slammer.

&quot;Thanks to President Trump&#39;s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early,&quot; Lichtenstein said in a late Thursday post on X.

&quot;I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,&quot; he continued. &quot;To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.&quot;

Trump signed the prison-reform First Step Act into law during his first term in 2018. A White House official confirmed Lichtenstein&#39;s early release to The Register, noting that he served &quot;significant time on his sentence&quot; and has been placed on home confinement, &quot;consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.&quot;

In a subsequent Xeet and selfie, Lichtenstein&#39;s wife Heather Morgan (aka Razzlekhan), who also pleaded guilty to helping launder the stolen crypto and received an early release from her 18-month sentence, called her husband&#39;s release &quot;the best New Years present I could get.&quot;

The infamous duo were arrested in February 2022, and in August 2023 pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges related to the 2016 theft of some 120,000 bitcoins from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex.

While Lichtenstein got five years behind bars for his crimes, Morgan received a lighter sentence and only spent about nine months in the clink, thanking &quot;Papa Trump&quot; in a bathtub video upon her early release.

Netflix released a 2024 documentary about the Bitfinex burglars called Biggest Heist Ever. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A cybercrook claims to have breached Pickett and Associates, a Florida-based engineering firm whose clients include major US utilities, and is selling what they claim to be about 139 GB of engineering data about Tampa Electric Company, Duke Energy Florida, and American Electric Power. The price is 6.5 bitcoin, which amounts to about $585,000.

Based in Tampa, Florida, Pickett USA provides transmission and distribution design, project management, surveying, aerial mapping, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) services to utilities and mining operations across the US and Caribbean.

When contacted by The Register, a Pickett USA spokesperson said the company has no comment on the alleged breach.

In screenshots shared on social media and posted on Daily Dark Web, the criminal claims to have stolen 892 files belonging to the engineering firm, which they describe on the for-sale post as &quot;real, operational engineering data from active projects of major utilities and is suitable for infrastructure analysis and risk assessment.&quot;

The crim says the haul spans more than 800 classified raw LiDAR point cloud files in .las format ranging from 100 MB to 2 GB each; full coverage of transmission line corridors and substations, which includes layers for bare earth, vegetation, conductors, and structures; high-resolution orthophotos in .ecw format; MicroStation design files and PTC settings; large vegetation feature files in .xyz format; and other files from active projects.

According to the crook – and, as we have repeatedly warned: criminals aren&#39;t the most trustworthy lot, so take this for what it is – the stolen files belong to some very large American utilities. Tampa Electric Company serves about 860,000 customers, including 90,000 businesses, across West Central Florida, while Duke Energy Florida has about 2 million residential and business customers across the state, and American Electric Power serves nearly 5.6 million customers across 11 states. The crook has offered four sample files to interested buyers as proof.

A Duke Energy spokesperson told The Register that it is investigating the criminal&#39;s claims.

&quot;With threats evolving every day, Duke Energy&#39;s highly skilled cyber security team works diligently to protect our businesses, systems and information technology assets and responds quickly if a cyber incident occurs,&quot; the spokesperson said in an email sent to The Register. &quot;We are taking the necessary actions to investigate this claim.&quot;

The other two companies did not respond to our request for comment.

This same criminal is also selling what they claim to be an internal database belonging to Germany&#39;s Enerparc AG and containing details about solar projects in Spain&#39;s Mallorca and Alicante regions.

These recent alleged breaches come as miscreants increasingly target critical sectors, and (if true) are especially concerning as they put transmission lines, energy stations, and ongoing projects at risk.

Last month, Amazon&#39;s Chief Information Security Officer blamed Russia&#39;s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for a years-long campaign targeting Western countries&#39; energy sectors and other critical infrastructure providers, and US government agencies and international partners warned operational technology (OT) owners and operators to secure their critical networks against attacks by pro-Russian hackers.

In late 2023 China&#39;s Volt Typhoon famously targeted power utilities in an effort to prepare Beijing for destructive cyberattacks against those targets.

It&#39;s not just government-backed attackers breaking into these critical facilities. Ransomware gangs and other financially motivated criminals have also shown an interest in critical infrastructure targets, as energy and water providers are more likely to pay extortion demands to keep the lights and heat on for customers and keep water flowing out of their faucets.

According to the FBI&#39;s most recent Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) annual report, ransomware posed the biggest threat to critical infrastructure organizations in 2024 with the number of complaints to the IC3 increasing nine percent compared to the year prior. In fact, America&#39;s critical infrastructure operators reported almost 4,900 cybersecurity threats in 2024 with ransomware (1,403 complaints) topping the list. ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿The secret to Netflix’s biggest hit wasn’t its love of the past, but how it spoke to the present.

﻿The secret to Netflix’s biggest hit wasn’t its love of the past, but how it spoke to the present.

The parking lot was packed. That’s the first Strange Thing.

A little background. Just about every mall is struggling now, but the Neshaminy Mall in Bensalem, Pennsylvania is more or less comatose. As Defector’s Dan McQuade, a lifelong Pennsylvanian and mall fan, wrote in his fond remembrance of the shopping center, the once bustling complex is mostly a shuttered ghost town, with half of it set to be demolished. There are only two real reasons to go there: a well-stocked Barnes & Noble and the AMC movie theater.

And people do go there for the movie theater. It’s one of only three theaters in the Philly area with an IMAX screen, making it a destination for fans of prestige formats. I’m there often in my job as a critic, and I’m used to the IMAX auditorium being a full house. The parking lot outside of the theater at 8PM on New Year’s Eve, the night it’s showing Stranger Things 5: The Finale, however, was on another level. The concession line was overwhelming (tickets were free, but to reserve a spot guests bought a $20 concession voucher), and waits for snacks more involved than popcorn, soda, and candy were substantial. The energy was infectious. It was the most crowded I’ve seen a theater since Barbenheimer.

This was disconcerting. I knew, intellectually, that Stranger Things was a big deal. Netflix, notoriously opaque but quite ruthless in pruning shows that do not meet whatever metrics it does not share, has always treated the show like its Avengers or Star Wars. Regular PR blasts trumpet all manner of impressive stats, new episodes cause the service to crash, and the cast and iconography show up in ads and brand deals that no other Netflix show gets. Season 4 put Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” back on the charts, one of many nostalgic hits the show has brought roaring back. Even in the dodgy world of streaming data, it’s clear Stranger Things has a big audience and remains a phenomenon even if later seasons are not the critical darlings the first was. It can be much harder to feel this.

There are many potential reasons: an increasingly fractured internet, the diffuse and curatorial nature of online fandom, Netflix’s conversation-killing binge-release strategy, and long gaps between seasons that snuffed out any sense of momentum. There’s also the show itself. Analyzing Stranger Things is not that difficult; the show has always more or less just meant what it said. There was no mystery it proposed that its characters wouldn’t solve, no reference that the show’s creators wouldn’t talk about (either themselves or through the show), and its narrative was almost entirely unconcerned with the world beyond Hawkins, Indiana. Even the Upside Down, the show’s other-dimensional realm of horrors, is so barren and empty that the final season declares its true nature to be a bridge and not a place, linking our world to the actual home of the show’s supernatural horrors. (And another surprisingly barren landscape.)

In practice, this makes Stranger Things a show that feels complex, but is quite easy to follow. Which also makes it the sort of thing all kinds of people would watch together. And maybe even drive out to a dead mall for on New Year’s Eve.

The second Strange Thing: According to the woman who scanned my ticket, this was the busiest she had seen this theater since Black Friday 2024, the weekend Gladiator II and Wicked both premiered. Back then, she remembers being told that theater staff expected 8,000 people for the day. On this night, they expected a crowd of 1,000 people to turn up over one hour.

I saw entire families, many in pajamas. Friends young and old. Lots of couples. There were Hellfire Club T-shirts, Demogorgon crowns and popcorn buckets (purchased in advance, from Target). Everyone was taking group selfies, posting photos or Instagram Reels of how crowded the concession area was. It’s New Year’s Eve, and everyone is having a ball.

Behind me in the concession line I met a woman named Gia who came with her daughters. They had been watching together since the first season in 2016 and love that the show’s exciting, “with lots of things happening.” They told me that they were nervous for the finale, “scared that people will die.”

”I like the nostalgia it brings to me, even though I didn’t grow up in the ’80s.”

There was a lot of that sort of talk. I overheard someone saying they thought Dustin was going to die, despite Steve’s efforts to save him. In the bathroom just before showtime, a teenager lamented how long his little brother was taking to wash his hands. “I swear to god,” he said. “If I miss a single fucking minute of this I’ll kill myself.”

I met one couple, Adam and Tiffany, who drove an hour to be there. Recently engaged and in their late 20s and early 30s, they began watching Stranger Things individually, as teenagers, before they started watching together. (He said this was season 3; she said it’s 4.)

“I like the nostalgia it brings to me, even though I didn’t grow up in the ’80s,” Adam said. He grew up watching E.T. and The Goonies, so he feels an affinity for the era in spite of his youth. He also loved the government conspiracy elements. “The first season it was really prevalent, with the MK Ultra stuff that it depicted. People didn’t know about it and it was a great way to expose people to it. I really enjoy that attitude the first season had and it kind of continues, especially in the latest season — the government does not always have your best interest in mind.”

Tiffany, for her part, feels like “we really have grown to know and love all of the characters, you know? I’m not ready to cry tonight.”

I must confess that I was continually surprised by all of this. I’ve grown accustomed to the asynchronous way most modern entertainment is enjoyed and discussed — often apologetically, as everyone triangulates how much of which shows they’ve seen and can talk about. Sports are among the only reliably communal experiences we get in front of our screens. Television as the characters on Stranger Things experienced it was communal, in shared living spaces where the screen fought for attention with the world around it. Television as Stranger Things fans have experienced it is virtually private, watched on a phone or laptop or TV at your convenience.

One last Strange Thing: Even for me, a Stranger Things hater, watching the finale in a packed house was frankly incredible. The crowd cheered early and often: when fan favorite Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) is saved from plummeting to his doom by his rival Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton); when newly minted fan-favorite character Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly) gives the villainous Vecna the finger with his “Suck my fat one!” catchphrase; when Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) stares down the massive, arachnid Mind Flayer in the finale’s climactic battle. When a character is thought to have died, a chorus of sniffles works its way through the room.

There is a sincerity to Stranger Things that is at odds with the cynicism of its marketing and imitators. The Duffer brothers are enthusiastic imitators that are happy to share their crib sheet, but they’ve always been open about what they’ve intended with Stranger Things. Despite all the dissonant things they’ve put inside of it as the show grew in every possible way, hopscotching from genre to genre often nonsensically, it remains a coming-of-age story about all the ways one can grow up.

It’s the secret weapon of the show, the way it’s not just about the four D&D-playing kids getting older, but their older siblings on the cusp of adulthood or their parents who sank into bad patterns and had to do some growing of their own. In this last season, the show leaned into its age, introducing younger siblings who are about to face things the core four did; caring for them is their final step to maturity.

Stranger Things’ relentless focus on nostalgia can make it easy to forget the present it aired in, and what it must have been like to grow up in that time. If you were a child watching it, you were a child watching when Donald Trump was elected the first time, when covid-19 took the world out from under you, when social media let our worst horrors beat a path right to your pocket. Your very own personal Upside Down.

“Life has been so unfair to you, so cruel,” Jim Hopper (David Harbour) tells his surrogate daughter early on in the finale, when Eleven is committed to dying in her fight against Vecna because she believes she doesn’t belong in the world anymore. He tells her to fight to imagine a life beyond the horror. “I know you don’t believe you can have any of this. But I promise you, we will find a way to make it real. You will find a way to make it real, because you have to. Because you deserve it.”

It’s a line that collapses the fourth wall, escaping the Hawkins / Upside Down of this movie-fueled vision of 1987 to crash right into the final moments of 2025. The roomful of fans, young and old, here with their families and partners and friends, taking selfies, hooting and hollering, haven’t just spent 10 years with characters on TV that feel like friends. They’ve grown up, and watched each other grow up, through hell. And the kids, young adults, and grown-ups of Stranger Things have gone through hell with them. A ludicrous, nonsensical nightmare parade that has, in some ways, rendered them unrecognizable from the people they were 10 years ago, the way bookish Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer) has now become a rifle-toting monster slayer.

Marking the end of that journey in a theater full of people who have been on it with you? What a way to close out a year. What a nice note to start a new one on, going back out into the world with all your fellow fans, looking for the right side up.

            <h2>This smart home controller is literally a piece of wood</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-03</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mui’s long-gestating calm-tech board finally ships — and it’s a thoughtful, if very expensive, alternative to screens.

One of the fun parts of being a tech journalist for over a decade is that occasionally you get to watch a truly unique gadget go from concept to reality — and, eventually, into your living room. That’s the case with the Mui Board, a smart home controller built into a piece of wood.

The Mui was first demoed at CES in 2019, and I’ve seen it at several shows over the years, in various iterations, always with the promise that it would ship soon. Well, this year it did (in limited quantities!), and I finally got to try one out in my living room.

A minimalist smart home controller made from a piece of wood, the Mui Board works with Matter, Sonos, Hue, and others. It takes a new approach to how we interact with technology in our homes.

You could call the Mui Board an anti-smart display. A Raspberry Pi-based smart home controller with Matter support, it’s just a piece of wood on your wall when not in use. But when you touch its capacitive surface, glowing dot-matrix icons appear, letting you control your music and lighting, set timers, view messages, and access other information you might use a smart display for.

The idea is that technology should blend into your home — be calm, accessible, and integrated, not jarring or distracting. Mui is a Japanese term for being in harmony with nature, and the device is certified by the Calm Tech Institute. As someone surrounded by screens and smart displays in my home, I have long been intrigued by Mui’s alternative approach and was excited to try it out.

I’ve had the Mui Board second gen in my home for a few days now, and while I haven’t had a chance to fully put it through its paces, I’ve been impressed by its responsiveness, thoughtful design, and ambitious scope.

The second-gen model debuted in 2023 but only became available for purchase earlier this year on Mui and Indiegogo. At $999 (on sale for $799), the Mui Board still feels closer to a beautifully realized concept than a mass-market product. It’s hard to imagine many people spending a thousand dollars on a smart home controller — but for the right person, it’s undeniably delightful.

Created by Japan-based Mui Labs, the Mui Board comes in two colors: natural maple or dark cherry. I am testing the maple version and have mounted it on the wall in my living room, just above my sofa.

From there, I can reach up and tap it to see the time or weather, check what’s playing on my Sonos system, control my Hue lights, set a timer, and see the latest headlines from The Verge via a neat RSS feed feature.

It’s a simple interface with minimalist icons that offer more control than you might expect at first glance. You can dim and turn lights on and off (no color changing), adjust a thermostat’s temperature, mode, and fan speed, open and close curtains and locks, and turn smart plugs on and off. What’s different from other smart home controllers with touch interfaces is that there are no ads, no chatty voice assistant, and no bright, distracting display vying for my attention.

Out of the box, the Mui Board connects to Wi-Fi and can display the time and weather. You can set timers, alarms, and reminders, and send messages to other Mui boards or the Mui app. It has two small built-in speakers and a microphone for recording messages, and is powered by an included AC adapter.

Touching and drawing on the Mui Board is its best feature. It’s responsive and easy to use, and it has some delightful features. A small cat roams around the board and changes direction when you tap it. There’s a piano / drum mode that turns the board into a music machine, and you write messages on it by hand, not with a keyboard. It feels like technology you can play with.

For smart home control, the Mui Board supports Matter and integrates with Sonos, Philips Hue, LIFX, SwitchBot, Ecobee, and Google Calendar APIs, among others, plus several Japanese services, including Radiko and the Echonet smart home protocol.

Using the fairly simple Mui app, I connected the board to my Sonos system, and it displayed the title of the currently playing track, volume, and playback controls, and I could skip forward or back in my playlist.

As a Matter controller, it can set up and control supported Matter devices directly, without using Amazon, Google, Apple, or similar services. It works with lighting, plugs, and thermostats, with locks next on the roadmap.

It currently supports Matter over Wi-Fi, with Thread support planned. There’s no Thread radio onboard, so you’ll need a third-party border router. Lighting works best so far, while the other categories are still in limited testing.

I successfully added a Meross Matter Wi-Fi smart plug directly to the board but struggled to pair some Matter devices, such as my Nest thermostat, using Matter’s multi-admin feature. I plan to do more testing here.

I was able to connect my Hue lighting setup and could turn on and off all the lights or control each individually on the board. It was fairly slow, however, probably because I have a large Hue setup, and it was using the cloud API rather than a local connection. I really liked the Veil of Night feature that lets you draw a line on the board to set a timer that gradually dims the lighting.

Ultimately, the Mui Board is a big button / switch for controlling your smart home, with the benefit of icons to guide you to what you’re doing without a bright screen. As with any icon-based control, it takes a bit of learning to remember which icon does what, but you can customize the layout to put your most-used controls on the first screen and scroll through additional screens for more options.

While I love the natural, furniture-like feel, when the board is off, it slightly resembles a two-by-four mounted on the wall — as if my husband abandoned a DIY project halfway through. A rounded edge, more sculptural profile, or small shelf accessory would go a long way toward softening the look. Also, there’s the issue of what to do with the cable.

I installed the Mui in our living room, but after using it for a few days, I think the ideal place for this is in a bedroom, over a bedside table or headboard. That’s the room most people would like to keep screens out of, yet still want to control lights, locks, music, etc., without reaching for a phone or using voice.

I don’t see using Mui Board exclusively as a smart home controller; its software doesn’t feel quite there yet for creating scenes and automations. But as an interface to your smart home, it’s a breath of fresh air. And as a fun device for controlling music, setting timers, and playing the piano, it’s successful, if very, very expensive.

It’s been a slow burn to get the Mui Board to where it is today, and I’m intrigued to see where this thoughtful company takes its calm tech concept next. Mui Labs will be at CES again this year, where the company plans to debut a new well-being-focused sleep experience and “movement-based lighting control” for the Mui Board.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hot on the heels of new year’s celebrations, the annual Consumer Electronics Show will get underway in early January 2026. Once again, Las Vegas will host a sprawling sneak peek at the tech that will shape the industry throughout 2026.

The Verge will be on the ground at CES 2026 covering the biggest announcements, press conferences, and gadgets and we’ll be sharing hands-on impressions and takeaways of the best new tech making its debut in Vegas. The show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 6th, for four days, but you can expect some of the major news to drop in the days and weeks leading up to the show.

You can stay on top of all of The Verge’s CES 2026 coverage right here including standout innovations, clever upgrades, and even the weird stuff the show is often known for.

The Fraimic Smart Canvas is a framed E-ink screen being shown off for the first time at CES 2026. It’s meant to mimic your typical wall art but, because nothing is sacred, instead of showing an actual painting or a photo by a human, it displays AI “art” generated by your voice prompts. The Smart Canvas is available for preorder in two sizes, standard for $399 and large for $999, though deliveries aren’t expected until June.

One of the fun parts of being a tech journalist for over a decade is that occasionally you get to watch a truly unique gadget go from concept to reality — and, eventually, into your living room. That’s the case with the Mui Board, a smart home controller built into a piece of wood.

The Mui was first demoed at CES in 2019, and I’ve seen it at several shows over the years, in various iterations, always with the promise that it would ship soon. Well, this year it did (in limited quantities!), and I finally got to try one out in my living room.

Have you always wanted to scan your groceries at home? If so, the newest smart fridge from GE Appliances is for you. There’s a barcode scanner built into the water dispenser that works along with an interior camera and an 8-inch tablet to help you keep track of what food you need and add it to your digital shopping list.

The GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant is being announced at CES 2026, which kicks off next week, and is slated to launch in April for $4,899 — $500 more than a comparable non-Kitchen Assistant model.

LG is teasing the 2026 Gram Pro laptops that will be fully unveiled at CES, including what the company claims is the “world’s lightest 17-inch RTX laptop.” The LG Gram Pro 17 (17Z90UR) and Gram Pro 16 (16Z90U) will introduce a new ultralight “Aerominum material” developed by LG that aims to reduce a laptop’s weight while reinforcing strength and scratch resistance.

The LG Gram Pro 17 will feature a 2,560 x 1600 display, paired with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 laptop GPU that has just 8GB of VRAM. LG claims it will still provide “ample performance for graphics-intensive tasks, content creation, and gaming.” You won’t be able to run most modern games at maxed-out settings in a playable state though, so you shouldn’t consider the Gram Pro 17 as a dedicated gaming laptop. LG hasn’t revealed how much the Gram Pro 17 will actually weigh, but notes that it will be exclusive to the US at launch.

Clicks is expanding beyond keyboard cases and bringing its QWERTY keys for phones to another format: a magnetic power bank accessory with a slide-out keyboard. The Power Keyboard offers a 2150mAh battery that can top off a phone battery via MagSafe or Qi2 wireless charging, but its real superpower is its full keyboard that can connect to your phone or smart device over Bluetooth. I love a multitasking battery pack, and a keyboard for my phone that I can throw in my bag? Sounds even sweeter.

The Power Keyboard offers a range of extendable positions to accommodate different sized phones. It’ll also work in landscape mode, or over Bluetooth without being physically attached to your device. This way, it can act as an input for a smart TV or a tablet in a pinch. The keyboard does need to draw power from its integrated battery to operate over Bluetooth; Clicks’ cofounder and marketing head Jeff Gadway tells me that users will be able to “protect milliamp-hourage for keyboard usage,” so your phone won’t gobble up all of its charge and leave it inoperable.

You ever find yourself thinking, “I wish my phone had a phone?” Good news, friend. Clicks — the company behind the QWERTY keyboard case for your iPhone — has just the thing: the Clicks Communicator. It’s intended as a kind of complement to your smartphone for when you just want to stay in touch without all the other distractions of your device. The Communicator comes with a full QWERTY keyboard, along with its own cellular connection, so you can leave your main phone behind. But that privilege comes at a price: $499, to be exact.

Let’s set aside the fact that the Communicator costs as much as a Pixel 9A and focus on the glorious gadgetness of it all. For starters, the Communicator comes with interchangeable back plates so you can switch up your style. There’s also a built-in headphone jack, a physical mute switch, and expandable storage via microSD — all the little things that mainstream phone makers have dropped over the past decade. The keyboard keys are physically larger than what you’ll get on the Clicks phone case, and the whole keyboard is touch sensitive so it can act as a trackpad.

The biggest tech show of the year kicks off next week, as some of the industry’s top players show up to Las Vegas for CES 2026. We’ll be there to see all the new product demos we can and to bring you the most exciting news from the show. Follow our coverage for a preview of all the new tech these companies are planning to launch in 2026.

Expect to see the usual suspects: laptops, smart home gadgets, and TVs, and a whole lot more wearables and health tech. We’re anticipating seeing more products with AI integration. Also, robots. Perhaps, humanoids even.

Fender, the guitar maker also known for its amps and speakers, has a new consumer electronics brand called Fender Audio making its debut at CES 2026. In addition to a new pair of wireless headphones, Fender Audio has announced a pair of portable Bluetooth speakers called ELIE, which is short for “Extremely Loud Infinitely Expressive.”

The ELIE speakers will be available in two sizes, but both versions can be connected to a second unit to create a stereo pair, or you can connect and sync up to 100 of them to fill a larger space with sound. They also both support a unique feature letting you listen to audio from up to four different audio inputs simultaneously. These can include a Bluetooth device like a smartphone, an instrument or microphone plugged into the ELIE’s XLR/1/4-inch combo jack with a cable, and two other accessories connected using Fender’s proprietary wireless system.

Fender Audio, the consumer electronics brand owned by the famous guitar maker, has announced its first pair of wireless headphones at CES 2026. What sets the Mix headphones apart from the competition are impressive battery life, a modular design that allows the ear cups and headband to be swapped to alternate colors, and a focus on longevity with a battery that’s easy to access and swap.

When they launch this year the Mix headphones will initially be available in olympic white and skyscraper black color options for $299.99. That’s considerably cheaper than Sony’s $450 flagship WH-1000XM6 headphones that debuted last May. We haven’t had a chance to test the Mix’s hybrid active noise cancellation to confirm if it’s comparable to Sony’s class-leading ANC in the WH-1000XM6, but Fender Audio bests Sony on battery life. While Sony’s ANC headphones max out at up to 30 hours of playback with ANC on and up to 40 hours with it off, the Mix headphones offer up to 52 hours with ANC and up to 100 hours without.

Punkt, the Switzerland-based, privacy-focused phone maker, is trying the whole “smartphone” thing again. The MC03 improves on some of the disappointing features of its previous effort, the MC02, while maintaining its security focus. Likewise, its software still comes with a subscription fee: the first year is included free, but it’s $12 per month after that. On top of that, the MC03 is Punkt’s first phone to be assembled in Europe rather than Asia, making good on its promise from earlier this year.

The MC02, released last year, wasn’t exactly a critical darling. Punkt seems to be addressing some of those criticisms with a more modern 6.67-inch 120Hz OLED compared to last year’s 60Hz LCD. The 5,200mAh battery is user-replaceable. The MC03 ships with AphyOS, from the equally privacy-oriented company Apostrophy, and it’s based on AOSP 15 — more current than the AOSP 13-based version the MC02 shipped with, though still a version behind this year’s flagships. The MC03 is IP68 rated, comes with a MediaTek 7300 chipset, and is scheduled to get three OS upgrades and five years of security updates.

The Freestyle Plus all-in-one portable projector features 430 ISO lumens, or “nearly twice the brightness of the previous generation,” according to Samsung. Great! But also a little strange since both the original and second generation Freestyle projectors listed “550 lumens” on their respective spec sheets.

See, projector makers are notorious for playing fast and loose with the lumen spec. So much so that Epson has been on a legal rampage over the last few years. As a result, companies like Anker, Yaber, AAXA, Xgimi, AWOL vision... even Dr. J have all been forced to restate brightness measurements in industry standard ISO lumens. That’s good because having a consistent lumen spec makes it easier to predict how the projected image will hold up to ambient light that wants to wash out the viewing experience.

Petkit has announced two new automated machines at CES 2026 designed to feed and care for your pets using AI-powered cameras that track their behavior and provide health insights that may otherwise go unnoticed.

Launching sometime in April 2026, the Petkit Yumshare Daily Feast is one of the first automatic dispensers that works with wet food. The machine can provide up to 7 days of meals and uses an NFC-based tracking system to automatically remove a serving if it hasn’t been consumed after 48 hours. UVC lighting helps sanitize the delivery of fresh meals, while an AI-powered 1080P night vision camera with a 140-degree field-of-view tracks when your pet eats and how much food is left over before a fresh pack is dispensed. Petkit plans to offer the Yumshare Daily Feast to pet food companies as a wet food serving platform instead of selling it directly to consumers, and each company will set the pricing of the machine and meal refills.

Want a sneak peek at HP’s CES 2026 lineup? Windows Latest claims to have the entire list — my eye is on the HP EliteBook X, which will reportedly let Intel’s Panther Lake, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2 Elite, and AMD’s reportedly refreshed Ryzen AI 400 compete head-to-head. Wonder which one is best!

Remember when Dell made the baffling decision last January to ditch its awesome XPS brand for the utterly milquetoast “Dell Pro” and “Dell Pro Max” instead? After just one year, VideoCardz’ sources report, XPS laptops are coming back. Dell will reportedly announce them at CES 2026 next week.

LG is adding a karaoke-focused party speaker to its lineup of Xboom devices, which is built in collaboration with Will.i.am. Announced this week, LG says the Stage 501 speaker comes with an “AI Karaoke Master” that can remove or adjust vocals from “virtually any song,” similar to the Soundcore Rave 3S.

It can also adjust the pitch of the songs to make them more comfortable to sing, and it doesn’t require karaoke-specific audio files to do so, according to LG. Like its predecessor, the Stage 501 features a five-sided design but comes equipped with upgraded dual woofers and full-range drivers that LG claims will deliver richer audio. The swappable 99Wh battery offers up to 25 hours of playback and delivers 160W of power (or up to 220W when plugged in).

GameSir is no stranger to experimenting with unique controller features — its Tarantula Pro can automatically swap its face button labels to accommodate alternate layouts, and its Pocket 1 clamps Game Boy controls onto your phone. What sets its new Swift Drive controller apart is a small steering wheel located smack-dab in the middle of the gamepad that’s connected to what GameSir calls the “world’s smallest direct drive motor” providing force feedback effects for racing games.

Pricing and availability hasn’t been announced yet, but GameSir has revealed plenty of details about the Swift Drive’s features and functionality. The steering wheel uses a “high-precision” Hall effect encoder with “up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering.” Its movement can be adjusted between 30 and 1080 degrees of rotation, and the wheel itself can be removed and swapped with alternate styles. Hall effect sensors are also used in the Swift Drive’s joysticks and buttons, while its triggers are further enhanced with individual haptic motors to simulate the feeling of ABS braking and wheel slip.

In just the past couple years, the art TV category that’s been dominated by Samsung’s The Frame has seen growth, with additions from both TCL and Hisense. Now LG has announced its own entry, the LG Gallery TV. The TV will leverage the Gallery+ service that LG released earlier this year, which includes thousands of display visuals ranging from pieces of art to cinematic images to gaming scenes. Much like Samsung’s Art Store, Gallery+ has a limited free option, but its full capability requires a subscription.

The new Gallery TV shouldn’t be confused with the G Series OLED TVs, like the LG G5, even though the G Series used to be called the Gallery Series up until a couple years ago. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with “a specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience” (so it likely has a matte coating). LG hasn’t specified the backlight configuration, but all of the other art TVs use edge lighting, so it’s a safe bet that this one will as well. OLED technology, while offering superior picture quality to mini LED, isn’t able to display a single image for an extended time without concern of image retention (or burn-in).

LG unveiled a whole new line of gaming monitors ahead of CES on Friday. The UltraGear evo line are all high-end monitors covering a range of technologies, but united by 5K resolution and AI upscaling.

The three flagships under the new branding are the 39GX950B, the 27GM950B, and the 52G930B. The first number in the model name indicates the size. The rest of the letters and numbers, well, I’m sure they mean something to someone.

For years, Samsung has made products that try to camouflage what they are by displaying works of art. The Frame TV is the most famous example, but the company also released the Music Frame, a speaker disguised as a picture frame, at last year’s CES. Now, instead of hiding a speaker with a piece of art, Samsung worked with designer Erwan Bouroullec to make a speaker into a piece of art.

According to Samsung, the Music Studio line of speakers, debuting at CES 2026, draw inspiration from the “timeless dot concept” found throughout music and art. As a musician, the Music Studio 5 reminds me of a fermata, the symbol meant to hold a note or silence. It has a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters with built-in waveguide.

LG is getting ready to take the wraps off a new robot it claims is capable of performing a “wide range” of household chores. The robot, called LG CLOiD, will make its debut at CES next month, featuring two articulated arms and five individually actuated fingers on each hand.

Though we only have a description and two images showing LG CLOiD’s five-fingered hands, it already seems a lot different from the two-wheeled home companion LG revealed last year, which came with a handle attached to its head rather than two arms.

Samsung is breaking new ground with its 2026 lineup of gaming monitors, with the Odyssey 3D G90XH becoming the first to feature a 6K display with “glasses-free 3D.” The new monitor comes with a 32-inch IPS panel, offering real-time eye-tracking that “adjusts depth and perspective” based on your position, along with a speedy 165Hz refresh rate that you can boost to 330Hz with a Dual Mode feature that switches to 3K.

The 2026 Odyssey 3D is an upgrade to the display Samsung revealed during CES last year, which comes with a smaller 27-inch display and a lower 4K resolution. We’ve seen a few other 6K monitors from Asus, Dell, and LG, though they don’t come with the Odyssey’s 3D effects or a focus on gaming. For now, select games like Stellar Blade, Lies of P: Overture, and The First Berserker: Khazan are optimized specifically for the Odyssey 3D, but several other titles still support its 3D effects, including Black Myth: Wukong, Hogwarts Legacy, Palworld, and Silent Hill 2.

Ahead of CES 2026 getting underway in early January, Birdfy has announced two new camera-equipped smart bird feeders that can identify and capture visitors in slow motion. The Birdfy Hum Bloom is specifically designed to attract and record hummingbirds using a nectar bulb that mimics flowers they’re naturally attracted to, while the Feeder Vista introduces a 360-degree camera and a bottom-up feeding system that doesn’t obstruct views. Both feeders are expected to be available in Q2 of 2026, but pricing hasn’t been announced.

The Birdfy Hum Bloom is built around an 8MP camera that can capture 4K video of hummingbirds at 20fps. Capturing 120fps slo-mo videos requires a drop in resolution to 1080P, but with hummingbirds flapping their wings around 50 to 80 times per second while hovering, you shouldn’t expect footage that will rival a National Geographic documentary.

The two already announced a collaboration back in October meant to “streamline creator workflows with AI.” Now the relationship is evolving into a dedicated button on new ASUS ProArt GoPro edition laptop that’ll probably also net a free subscription to GoPro Premium Plus for some period of time. All will be revealed at CES on January 6th.

Displace’s $5,999 wireless TV with a battery-powered suction mount is only available with a 55-inch 4K OLED panel. But at CES 2026, the company will be introducing a new $1,999 Displace Hub mounting system that works with any 55 to 100-inch TV of your choosing, as long as it weighs less than 150 pounds.

Dolby Atmos FlexConnect technology debuted this year with the TCL Z100 speakers, and now we’re getting our first FlexConnect soundbar thanks to LG. The new H7 soundbar — which runs on the same Alpha 11 Gen 3 chip as LG’s OLEDs and new Micro RGB LED — is a part of the LG Sound Suite, a modular home audio system the company will debut at CES 2026. In addition to the soundbar, the Sound Suite will include the M5 and M7 surround speakers and the W7 subwoofer. All of the speakers feature Peerless Audio components.

The two main drawbacks of TCL’s Dolby FlexConnect implementation were the limitation of only allowing four connected speakers, including a sub, and the need for a 2025 QM series TCL TV. So you needed to pick between better sound coverage with a fourth speaker or more bass performance with a sub. LG’s Sound Suite, on the other hand, will allow you to connect the soundbar with up to four surround speakers and a subwoofer for a potential 13.1.7-channel system.

            <div id="article-text">﻿xAI’s AI chatbot is putting Elon Musk in a bikini at his request — and doing the same to children, world leaders, and women without their consent.

﻿xAI’s AI chatbot is putting Elon Musk in a bikini at his request — and doing the same to children, world leaders, and women without their consent.

xAI’s Grok is removing clothing from pictures of people without their consent following this week’s rollout of a feature that allows X users to instantly edit any image using the bot without needing the original poster’s permission. Not only does the original poster not get notified if their picture was edited, but Grok appears to have few guardrails in place for preventing anything short of full explicit nudity. In the last few days, X has been flooded with imagery of women and children appearing pregnant, skirtless, wearing a bikini, or in other sexualized situations. World leaders and celebrities, too, have had their likenesses used in images generated by Grok.

AI authentication company Copyleaks reported that the trend to remove clothing from images began with adult-content creators asking Grok for sexy images of themselves after the release of the new image editing feature. Users then began applying similar prompts to photos of other users, predominantly women, who did not consent to the edits. Women noted the rapid uptick in deepfake creation on X to various news outlets, including Metro and PetaPixel. Grok was already able to modify images in sexual ways when tagged in a post on X, but the new “Edit Image” tool appears to have spurred the recent surge in popularity.

In one X post, now removed from the platform, Grok edited a photo of two young girls into skimpy clothing and sexually suggestive poses. Another X user prompted Grok to issue an apology for the “incident” involving “an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire,” calling it “a failure in safeguards” that it said may have violated xAI’s policies and US law. (While it’s not clear whether the Grok-created images would meet this standard, realistic AI-generated sexually explicit imagery of identifiable adults or children can be illegal under US law.) In another back-and-forth with a user, Grok suggested that users report it to the FBI for CSAM, noting that it is “urgently fixing” the “lapses in safeguards.”

But Grok’s word is nothing more than an AI-generated response to a user asking for a “heartfelt apology note” — it doesn’t indicate Grok “understands” what it’s doing or necessarily reflect operator xAI’s actual opinion and policies. Instead, xAI responded to Reuters’ request for comment on the situation with just three words: “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI did not respond to The Verge’s request for comment in time for publication.

Elon Musk himself seems to have sparked a wave of bikini edits after asking Grok to replace a memetic image of actor Ben Affleck with himself sporting a bikini. Days later, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un’s leather jacket was replaced with a multicolored spaghetti bikini; US President Donald Trump stood nearby in a matching swimsuit. (Cue jokes about a nuclear war.) A photo of British politician Priti Patel, posted by a user with a sexually suggestive message in 2022, got turned into a bikini picture on January 2nd. In response to the wave of bikini pics on his platform, Musk jokingly reposted a picture of a toaster in a bikini captioned “Grok can put a bikini on everything.”

While some of the images — like the toaster — were evidently meant as jokes, others were clearly designed to produce borderline-pornographic imagery, including specific directions for Grok to use skimpy bikini styles or remove a skirt entirely. (The chatbot did remove the skirt, but it did not depict full, uncensored nudity in the responses The Verge saw.) Grok also complied with requests to replace the clothes of a toddler with a bikini.

Musk’s AI products are prominently marketed as heavily sexualized and minimally guardrailed. xAI’s AI companion Ani flirted with Verge reporter Victoria Song, and Jess Weatherbed discovered that Grok’s video generator readily created topless deepfakes of Taylor Swift, despite xAI’s acceptable use policy banning the depiction of “likenesses of persons in a pornographic manner.” Google’s Veo and OpenAI’s Sora video generators, in contrast, have guardrails around generation of NSFW content, though Sora has also been used to produce videos of children in sexualized contexts and fetish videos. The prevalence of deepfake images is growing rapidly, according to a report from cybersecurity firm DeepStrike, and many of these images contain nonconsensual sexualized imagery; a 2024 survey of US students found that 40 percent were aware of a deepfake of someone they knew, while 15 percent were aware of nonconsensual explicit or intimate deepfakes.

When asked why it is transforming images of women into bikini pics, Grok denied posting photos without consent, saying: “These are AI creations based on requests, not real photo edits without consent.”

﻿Lichtenstein reunited with wife and fellow hacker Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan this week.

Just over a year after being sentenced to five years in prison for the theft of billions of dollars in Bitcoin, hacker Ilya Lichtenstein is free. Lichtenstein announced his release in a post on X, specifically crediting Trump: “Thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early. I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can.”

The First Step Act Lichtenstein referenced is a criminal justice reform bill passed in 2018 during the first Trump administration and expands options for early release, such as earned time credits. A Trump administration official confirmed the early release in a statement to CNBC, claiming that Lichtenstein “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.”

Lichtenstein’s wife, Heather Morgan, replied to his announcement post with a photo of the two of them. Morgan, who some might know as the infamous rapper “Razzlekhan” or “the Crocodile of Wall Street,” was also charged for the scheme to launder billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex. She was only sentenced to 18 months in prison, but was also apparently released early, a development she announced from her bathtub in a post on X in October. Morgan and Lichtenstein weren’t arrested for the hack until 2022. The duo have since become the subject of a Netflix docuseries and an upcoming film.

Nadella wants everyone to move beyond the arguments about AI slop.

Now that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has appointed a new CEO to run Microsoft’s biggest businesses, he has a little more time on his hands for other adventures. Beyond focusing on Microsoft’s technical work, Nadella is now turning to the ancient art of blogging to discuss Microsoft’s year ahead and why he thinks everyone needs to move “beyond the arguments of [AI] slop vs sophistication.”

Nadella’s first blog entry in “sn scratchpad” is all about Microsoft and other AI companies still needing to get a bunch of stuff right with AI. Chief among them is creating a new concept for AI that evolves the “bicycles for the mind” concept that Steve Jobs used to describe computers as tools in the ’90s. “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other,” says Nadella.

Nadella wants to move beyond the usual AI slop arguments, because Microsoft is betting on getting everyone hooked on AI agents instead of the Office and Windows software that has powered so many industries for decades.

This speaks to the tension with AI models right now and the fear from creatives about being edged out by AI models that are capable of copying the style of artists, designers, filmmakers, and more. We’ve been using PCs as tools for decades to create art, write code, and beyond, but Microsoft and others now want us to rely on AI agents as the new tools for creation instead — even if a lot of what is generated is slop.

Microsoft has a vision of everyone using Copilot with our voices to create content, search for information, and discover how to use things. The problem is that the vision doesn’t match reality right now, and barely any of what Copilot promises to do actually works.

Microsoft is betting on improved AI models to help Copilot and its own AI offerings, just as Meta warns that you can’t trust your eyes to tell you what’s real anymore. While Nadella has been part of the OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic AI model battle of 2025, he now argues that it’s how people choose to apply AI instead of individual model power that ultimately matters.

“We will evolve from models to systems when it comes to deploying AI for real world impact,” says Nadella. These systems will have to take into consideration the societal impact they have on people and the planet, he says. “The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter. This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.”

Nadella’s first sn scratchpad blog entry is brief, but it’s all about 2026 being a “pivotal year for AI.” The same could be said for 2025, but Nadella thinks the industry now has a “clearer sense of where the tech is headed” and how it will shape its impact on the world. We’ll have to revisit whether the tech industry gets AI right this year once 2027 rolls around, but Nadella is now promising to deliver more of his personal “notes on advances in technology and real-world impact” in future blog posts throughout 2026.

            <h2>3 things Will Douglas Heaven is into right now</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129409/will-douglas-heaven-el-estepario-siberiano-ed-atkins-laura-jean-mckay/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano’s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.

Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there’s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It’s why my favorites are Garrido’s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine. Check out his version of Skrillex and Missy Elliot’s “Ra Ta Ta” and tell me it doesn’t put happiness in your heart.

Watching Sora ­videos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.

In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing,” Atkins has said. “I want everything I make to corpse.” Next to Atkins’s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive.

What’s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay’s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you’d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don’t even make any sense.

With everybody now talking to their computers, McKay’s book resets the anthropomorphic trap we’ve all fallen into. It’s a brilliant evocation of what a nonhuman mind might contain—and a meditation on the hard limits of communication.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <h2>Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129416/head-transplant-surgeon-sergio-canavero-future-job/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.

Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent. The Chicago Tribune labeled him the “P.T. Barnum of transplantation.”

Canavero withdrew from the spotlight. But the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups.

It’s been rocky. After he began publishing his surgical ideas a decade ago, Canavero says, he got his “pink slip” from the Molinette Hospital in Turin, where he’d spent 22 years on staff. “I’m an out-of-the-establishment guy. So that has made things harder, I have to say,” he says.

No other solution to aging is on the horizon. “It’s become absolutely clear over the past years that the idea of some incredible tech to rejuvenate elderly people—­happening in some secret lab, like Google—is really going nowhere,” he says. “You have to go for the whole shebang.”

He means getting a new body, not just one new organ. Canavero has an easy mastery of English idioms and an unexpected Southern twang. He says that’s due to a fascination with American comics as a child. “For me, learning the language of my heroes was paramount,” he says. “So I can shoot the breeze.”

Canavero is now an independent investigator and has advised entrepreneurs who want to create brainless human clones as a source of DNA-matched organs that wouldn’t get rejected by a recipient’s immune system. “I can tell you there are guys from top universities involved,” he says.

Combining the necessary technologies, like reliably precise surgical robots and artificial wombs to grow the clones, is going to be complex and very, very expensive. Canavero lacks the funds to take his plans further, but he believes “the money is out there” for a commercial moonshot project: “What I say to the billionaires is ‘Come together.’ You will all have your own share, plus make yourselves immortal.”

            <h2>Why inventing new emotions feels so good</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/31/1129403/new-emotions-online-life-feelings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <h2>Is ChatGPT’s New Shopping Research Solving a Problem, or Creating One?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
