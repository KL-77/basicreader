            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.23 of the Rocket Report! Several new rockets made their first flights this year. Blue Origin’s New Glenn was the most notable debut, with a successful inaugural launch in January followed by an impressive second flight in November, culminating in the booster’s first landing on an offshore platform. Second on the list is China’s Zhuque-3, a partially reusable methane-fueled rocket developed by the quasi-commercial launch company LandSpace. The medium-lift Zhuque-3 successfully reached orbit on its first flight earlier this month, and its booster narrowly missed landing downrange. We could add China’s Long March 12A to the list if it flies before the end of the year. This will be the final Rocket Report of 2025, but we’ll be back in January with all the news that’s fit to lift.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Rocket Lab delivers for Space Force and NASA. Four small satellites rode a Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle into orbit from Virginia early Thursday, beginning a government-funded technology demonstration mission to test the performance of a new spacecraft design, Ars reports. The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility. A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers). The launch was the starting gun for a “proof of concept” mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats, designed by the Aerospace Corporation.

Stack ’em high… “DiskSat is a lightweight, compact, flat disc-shaped satellite designed for optimizing future rideshare launches,” the Aerospace Corporation said in a statement. The DiskSats are 39 inches (1 meter) wide, about twice the diameter of a New York-style pizza, and measure just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick. Made of composite carbon fiber, each satellite carries solar cells, control avionics, reaction wheels, and an electric thruster to change and maintain altitude. The flat design allows DiskSats to be stacked one on top of the other for launch. The format also has significantly more surface area than other small satellites with comparable mass, making room for more solar cells for high-power missions or large-aperture payloads like radar imaging instruments or high-bandwidth antennas. NASA and the US Space Force cofunded the development and launch of the DiskSat demo mission.

SpaceX warns of dangerous Chinese launch. China’s recent deployment of nine satellites occurred dangerously close to a Starlink satellite, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering said. Michael Nicolls wrote in a December 12 social media post that there was a 200-meter close approach between a satellite launched December 10 on a Chinese Kinetica-1 rocket and SpaceX’s Starlink-6079 spacecraft at 560 kilometers (348 miles) altitude, Aviation Week and Space Technology reports. “Most of the risk of operating in space comes from the lack of coordination between satellite operators—this needs to change,” Nicolls wrote.

Blaming the customer... The company in charge of the Kinetica-1 rocket, CAS Space, responded to Nicolls’ post on X saying it would “work on identifying the exact details and provide assistance.” In a follow-up post on December 13, CAS Space said the close call, if confirmed, occurred nearly 48 hours after the satellite separated from the Kinetica-1 rocket, by which time the launch mission had long concluded. “CAS Space will coordinate with satellite operators to proceed.”

A South Korean startup is ready to fly. Innospace, a South Korean space startup, will launch its independently developed commercial rocket, Hanbit-Nano, as soon as Friday, the Maeil Business Newspaper reports. The rocket will lift off from the Alcântara Space Center in Brazil. The small launcher will attempt to deliver eight small payloads, including five deployable satellites, into low-Earth orbit. The launch was delayed two days to allow time for technicians to replace components of the first stage oxidizer supply cooling system.

Hybrid propulsion… This will be the first launch of Innospace’s Hanbit-Nano rocket. The launcher has two stages and stands 71 feet (21.7 meters) tall with a diameter of 4.6 feet (1.4 meters). Hanbit-Nano is a true micro-launcher, capable of placing up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms) of payload mass into Sun-synchronous orbit. It has a unique design, with hybrid engines consuming a mix of paraffin as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer.

Ten years since a milestone in rocketry. On December 21, 2015, SpaceX launched the Orbcomm-2 mission on an upgraded version of its Falcon 9 rocket. That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. Ars has reprinted a slightly condensed chapter from the book Reentry, authored by Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. The chapter begins in June 2015 with the failure of a Falcon 9 rocket during launch of a resupply mission to the International Space Station and ends with a vivid behind-the-scenes recounting of the historic first landing of a Falcon 9 booster to close out the year.

First-person account… I have my own memory of SpaceX’s first rocket landing. I was there, covering the mission for another publication, as the Falcon 9 lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. In an abundance of caution, Air Force officials in charge of the Cape Canaveral spaceport closed large swaths of the base for the Falcon 9’s return to land. The decision shunted VIPs and media representatives to viewing locations outside the spaceport’s fence, so I joined SpaceX’s official press room at the top of a seven-floor tower near the Port Canaveral cruise terminals. The view was tremendous. We all knew to expect a sonic boom as the rocket came back to Florida, but its arrival was a jolt. The next morning, I joined SpaceX and a handful of reporters and photographers on a chartered boat to get a closer look at the Falcon 9 standing proudly after returning from space.

Roscosmos targets quick fix to Soyuz launch pad. Russian space agency Roscosmos says it expects a damaged launch pad critical to International Space Station operations to be fixed by the end of February, Aviation Week and Space Technology reports. “Launch readiness: end of February 2026,” Roscosmos said in a statement Tuesday. Russia had been scrambling to assess the extent of repairs needed to Pad 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan after the November 27 flight of a Soyuz-2.1a rocket damaged key elements of the infrastructure. The pad is the only one capable of supporting Russian launches to the ISS.

Best-case scenario… A quick repair to the launch pad would be the best-case scenario for Roscosmos. A service structure underneath the rocket was unsecured during the launch of a three-man crew to the ISS last month. The structure fell into the launch pad’s flame trench, leaving the complex without the service cabin technicians use to work on the Soyuz rocket before liftoff. Roscosmos said a “complete service cabin replacement kit” has arrived at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and more than 130 staff are working in two shifts to implement the repairs. A fix by the end of February would allow Russia to resume cargo flights to the ISS in March.

Atlas V closes out an up-and-down year for ULA. United Launch Alliance aced its final launch of 2025, a predawn flight of an Atlas V rocket Tuesday carrying 27 satellites for Amazon’s recently rebranded Leo broadband Internet service, Spaceflight Now reports. The rocket flew northeast from Cape Canaveral to place the Amazon Leo satellites into low-Earth orbit. This was ULA’s fourth launch for Amazon’s satellite broadband venture, previously known as Project Kuiper. ULA closes out 2025 with six launches, one more than the company achieved last year. But ULA’s new Vulcan rocket launched just once this year, disappointingly short of the company’s goal to fly Vulcan up to 10 times.

Taking stock of Amazon Leo… This year marked the start of the deployment of Amazon’s operational satellites. There are now 180 Amazon Leo satellites in orbit after Tuesday’s launch, well short of the FCC’s requirement for Amazon to deploy half of its planned 3,232 satellites by July 31, 2026. Amazon won’t meet the deadline, and it’s likely the retail giant will ask government regulators for a waiver or extension to the deadline. Amazon’s factory is hitting its stride producing and delivering Amazon Leo satellites. The real question is launch capacity. Amazon has contracts to launch satellites on ULA’s Atlas V and Vulcan rockets, Europe’s Ariane 6, and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Early next year, a batch of 32 Amazon Leo satellites will launch on the first flight of Europe’s uprated Ariane 64 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

A good year for Ariane 6. Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket launched four times this year after a debut test flight in 2024. The four successful missions deployed payloads for the French military, Europe’s weather satellite agency, the European Union’s Copernicus environmental monitoring network, and finally, on Wednesday, the European Galileo navigation satellite fleet, Space News reports. This is a strong showing for a new rocket flying from a new launch pad and a faster ramp-up of launch cadence than any medium- or heavy-lift rocket in recent memory. All five Ariane 6 launches to date have used the Ariane 62 configuration with two strap-on solid rocket boosters. The more powerful Ariane 64 rocket, with four strap-on motors, will make its first flight early next year.

Aiming high… This was the first launch using the Ariane 6 rocket’s ability to fly long-duration missions lasting several hours. The rocket’s cryogenic upper stage, with a restartable Vinci engine, took nearly four hours to inject two Galileo navigation satellites into an orbit more than 14,000 miles (nearly 23,000 kilometers) above the Earth. The flight profile put more stress on the Ariane 6 upper stage than any of the rocket’s previous missions, but the rocket released its payloads into an on-target orbit. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

ESA wants to do more with Ariane 6’s kick stage. The European Space Agency plans to adapt a contract awarded to ArianeGroup in 2021 for an Ariane 6 kick stage to cover its evolution into an orbital transfer vehicle, European Spaceflight reports. The original contract was for the development of the Ariane 6’s Astris kick stage, an optional addition for Ariane 6 missions to deploy payloads into multiple orbits or directly inject satellites into geostationary orbit. Last month, ESA’s member states committed approximately 100 million euros ($117 million) to refocus the Astris kick stage into a more capable Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV).

Strong support from Germany… ESA’s director of space transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, said the performance of the Ariane 6 OTV will be “well beyond” that of the originally conceived Astris kick stage. The funding commitment obtained during last month’s ESA ministerial council meeting includes strong support from Germany, Tolker-Nielsen said. Under the new timeline, a protoflight mode of the OTV is expected to be ready for ground qualification by the end of 2028, with an inaugural flight following in 2029. (submitted EllPeaTea)

Another Starship clone in China. Every other week, it seems, a new Chinese launch company pops up with a rocket design and a plan to reach orbit within a few years. For a long time, the majority of these companies revealed designs that looked a lot like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. Now, Chinese companies are starting to introduce designs that appear quite similar to SpaceX’s newer, larger Starship rocket, Ars reports. The newest entry comes from a company called “Beijing Leading Rocket Technology.” This outfit took things a step further by naming its vehicle “Starship-1,” adding that the new rocket will have enhancements from AI and is billed as being a “fully reusable AI rocket.”

Starship prime… China has a long history of copying SpaceX. The country’s first class of reusable rockets, which began flying earlier this month, show strong similarities to the Falcon 9 rocket. Now, it’s Starship. The trend began with the Chinese government. In November 2024, the government announced a significant shift in the design of its super-heavy lift rocket, the Long March 9. Instead of the previous design, a fully expendable rocket with three stages and solid rocket boosters strapped to the sides, the country’s state-owned rocket maker revealed a vehicle that mimicked SpaceX’s fully reusable Starship. At least two more companies have announced plans for Starship-like rockets using SpaceX’s chopstick-style method for booster recovery. Many of these launch startups will not grow past the PowerPoint phase, of course.

            <h2>ByteDance confirms TikTok will be controlled by US owners</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/bytedance-confirms-tiktok-will-be-sold-to-us-owners/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a year of stalled negotiations, TikTok owner ByteDance has reportedly agreed to Donald Trump’s deal giving US owners majority ownership of the app.

By signing the agreements, ByteDance has ended a prolonged period of uncertainty for millions of Americans who rely on TikTok for news, entertainment, social connection, and income. Under a law that Trump declined to enforce—which lawmakers convinced the Supreme Court was critical for national security—TikTok risked a US ban next year if the sale did not go through.

According to Reuters, terms of the deal match what was reported in September when Trump controversially confirmed that ByteDance would keep the algorithm. Under the deal, US investors and allies—including cloud computing firm Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX—will likely license the algorithm.

Together, those owners will control 80.1 percent of TikTok while China-based ByteDance retains a 19.9 percent stake, as well as one of seven board seats. To ensure that China has no access to US data to spy on Americans or tweak the algorithm to indoctrinate users with political propaganda, Oracle will serve as a “trusted security partner,” Reuters reported.

In a memo to staff reviewed by Reuters, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew confirmed that all US data “will be stored in a trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States run by Oracle,” with Oracle ultimately responsible for safeguarding US data.

Describing the deal as a “joint venture,” he confirmed that the US company would “operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.” But ByteDance would separately “manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.”

According to Trump, the deal ensures that TikTok complies with the divest-or-ban law, but the White House is still not providing more details. Instead, the Trump administration “referred questions about the deal to TikTok,” Reuters reported.

If the deal closes as expected on January 22, the new US company will have an estimated value of $14 billion, Vice President JD Vance noted in September.

At that point, the deal will likely face mounting scrutiny from lawmakers, including Republicans, who aren’t yet sure if the US operation resolves all national security concerns. Chinese control of the algorithm was a particular sticking point for critics, who claimed that Trump was giving China exactly what it wanted: international recognition for exporting leading technology to the US.

In September, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R.-Iowa) vowed to take a “hard line” and oppose the deal’s framework if it violates the divest-or-ban law. Already, Representative John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House Select Committee on China, is planning to hold a hearing next year with US TikTok leadership.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has accused Trump of handing over “even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies,” through the TikTok deal, which she likened to enabling a “billionaire takeover of TikTok.” Many TikTokers likely share her concerns, after Trump suggested he’d like to see his hand-picked investors tweak the algorithm to be “100 percent MAGA.”

Questions remain until the exact terms of the deal become public, Warren said.

ByteDance did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.

With the terms obscured, it’s unclear how quickly TikTok may change in 2026 under US ownership. Back in July, the Information reported that when approximately 170 million US users get ported over to the new US-owned app, it could be buggy.</div>

            <div id="article-text">It may be happening quietly, but there is a revolution taking place with in-space transportation, and it opens up a world of possibilities.

Back in January, a small spacecraft built by a California-based company called Impulse Space launched along with a stack of other satellites on a Falcon 9 rocket. Upon reaching orbit, the rocket’s upper stage sent the satellites zipping off on their various missions.

And so it went with the Mira spacecraft built by Impulse, which is known as an orbital transfer vehicle. Mira dropped off several small CubeSats and then performed a number of high-thrust maneuvers to demonstrate its capabilities. This was the second flight by a Mira spacecraft, so Impulse Space was eager to continue testing the vehicle in flight.

This was all well and good up until this summer, when a funny thing happened. Impulse handed control of Mira over to another company, which had installed its own software package on the vehicle. And this second company, Starfish Space, took control.

This was more than a little weird, acknowledged Eric Romo, the president and chief operating officer of Impulse Space, in an interview.

“I would walk past mission control, and our teams would be on a call together, and I would just pop my head in and say, ‘Hey, don’t crash spaceship, please,&#39;” Romo said. “It was definitely a new thing.”

But Starfish Space did not crash Mira. Rather, it activated its camera on board the spacecraft and started flying the vehicle. To what end? Founded in 2019, the Washington-based company seeks to build affordable spacecraft that can service satellites in space, providing propulsion or other aids to extend their lifetimes.

Now, flying Mira, the company sought to demonstrate that a single lightweight camera system, along with its closed-loop guidance, navigation, and control software, could autonomously rendezvous with another spacecraft. In this case, it was the very first Mira spacecraft launched by Impulse, in November 2023. This vehicle no longer has propellant on board to control its orientation, but its solar panels periodically receive enough charge to allow it to communicate with Impulse’s engineers in California.

When the newer Mira got to within about 20 km of the older spacecraft, the Starfish team handed control over to the onboard computer. If they were going to test the vehicle’s software in flight for rendezvous and proximity operations, or RPO, they were really going to test it.

“We had to push the envelope a little bit here,” said Trevor Bennett, a co-founder of Starfish, in an interview. “And so there was always going to be that level of discomfort because we knew that this was an unpracticed and undemonstrated thing before, and then we wanted to go make it demonstrated, and go build that trust.”

The Starfish software guided Mira closer and closer to the older spacecraft, bringing it within 1,250 meters and validating the company’s autonomous software. It was quite a coup, demonstrating the agility of Mira and the ingenuity of the Starfish software. And it happened fast, with the whole plan coming together in less than a year.

Success gives Starfish confidence that its full-sized “Otter” spacecraft, about the size of an oven, will work upon its debut flight next year when it launches to provide propulsion to an SES satellite in geostationary orbit.

This is far from the first rendezvous in space. NASA and the Soviet Union space program were testing rendezvous and docking all the way back in the 1960s. It is not even the first commercial rendezvous and proximity mission. Back in 2020, Northrop Grumman’s MEV-1 spacecraft docked with another satellite in geostationary orbit, 36,000 km above the Earth.

However, Starfish says the full-size Otter’s cost is significantly lower than existing solutions, about an order of magnitude lower than MEV-1 or other options that limit the number of applications for servicing satellites.

“The Northrop Grumman spacecraft, or others, are still really large spacecraft, really exquisite sensors, exquisite hardware, multiple thrusters and geometry specifically designed for that kind of mission,” Bennett said. “I think what is really impressive in this case is we took a vehicle that’s rather versatile in its own right but then upgraded it to something that’s RPO capable, with just a camera and a little bit of software.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs have been found to cut risks for a variety of health issues — ranging from heart to kidney disease — netting the pharma companies behind them billions of projected dollars in revenue over the next decade.

But in rare cases, this class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists can come with a debilitating side effects. Chief among them is blindness, which as Reuters reports has prompted patients who lost their eyesight to file more than 70 lawsuits against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the two major drug companies behind Ozempic and Mounjaro, respectively.

The lawsuits, in both federal and state courts, allege that these drugs gave patients a condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, in which blood flow to the optic nerve stops and causes a person to lose vision.

Earlier this week, a federal judicial panel approved the consolidation of these lawsuits and that a Pennsylvania federal judge will preside over these cases — setting the stage for a legal showdown that could have immense implications for the future of the drugs, which have exploded in popularity over the past few years.

And the suits aren’t the only storm clouds on the horizon for GLP-1 manufacturers: they’re separate from another batch of litigation that alleges that these drugs can cause gastroparesis, in which the gastrointestinal tract stops moving food along for digestion.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first GLP-1 agonist drug back in 2005 to treat diabetes. Fast forward to 2021, and the FDA gave Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk the greenlight to make and manufacture Wegovy, which works the same way as Ozempic but is geared towards people who want to lose weight.

That monumental decision, along with a rush of positive press, kicked off the current craze for these weight loss drugs, which has seen celebrities like Oprah and Rebel Wilson shed pounds over a short amount of time.

But in the last couple of years, a growing number of people have reported severe side effects from using these medications, dampening the buzz around drugs that have often been touted as a miracle cure for a wide variety of conditions — even aging.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a year of record gains for the crypto industry, recent forces have sent itinto a tailspin. Bitcoin, for example, reached dazzling heights of more than $120,000 in October — before crashing back down to around $88,000 today, about 12 percent down from where it was a year ago.

While that might be bad news for crypto bros or Robinhood day traders, one economist argues that the decline is actually good news for the rest of us.

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research Dean Baker argued in his blog Beat The Press this week that as the major cryptocurrencies fall, purchasing power for the rest of us goes up. In his analysis, he compares crypto to counterfeit currency — fake money that allows shady gangs to buy up all kinds of scarce goods, like houses and sports tickets.

When they buy up those goods with funny money, they help drive prices up, making them less affordable for those of us who don’t play the game.

“If some supersleuth detective figured out a way to recognize the counterfeit bills, they could then remove trillions of dollars of fake money from circulation,” Baker explains. “This would benefit the general public by reducing demand in the economy and reversing the run-up in the price of housing and Superbowl tickets. It is the same story with plunging crypto prices.”

From this reading, crypto — which infamously has no real value — allows people to suck up “large chunks” of the economy with a currency that’s built on thin air. When their share of fake money shrinks, it eases pressure on the rest of us. “To put it simply: there’s more for everyone else,” Baker explains.

We’re not talking small, intangible changes, either. By Baker’s count, the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium have shed over $1.2 trillion in market cap, or “enough to send every household in the United States a check for $10,000.”

In his thinking, everybody who doesn’t own it should be cheering for crypto’s ongoing downfall to continue.

“The only possible impact of lower crypto prices on production is that we will make less crypto,” says Baker. “The horror! The horror!”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sure, an inexplicable small-town mystery is fun.

But for John Grossnickle, sheriff of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, this one’s getting a little stale. For over a year, Sweetwater officials have been trying to get to the bottom of a series of unexplained appearances by unidentified flying objects.

Alarmingly, the UFOs seem to have a peculiar interest in a local power facility, the Jim Bridger Steam Plant, which houses four coal-fired generators.

“We’ve worked with everybody,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Jason Mower told the Cowboy State Daily. “We’ve done everything we can to figure out what they are, and nobody wants to give us any answers.”

Sheriff Grossnickle, who began fielding calls about the sightings 13 months ago, says he’s now observed them with his own eyes. The objects are said to be “lighted” and “drone-like,” and congregate together in “coordinated formations,” CSD reports. They’re typically reported between 2am or 3am.

Shooting them down isn’t an option, as they fly thousands of feet above ground. A state investigation doesn’t seem to be on the table either, as Wyoming National Guard adjutant general Greg Porter said he “doesn’t think he could discuss [them] in open testimony,” per CSD.

“It’s like the new normal,” Mower explained. “It’s like this phenomenon that continues to happen, but it’s not causing any, you know, issues that we have to deal with — other than the presence of them.”

Officials in Sweetwater aren’t alone. Seven sheriffs of nearby counties canvassed by CSD said they’d either viewed similar mystery objects or received reports about them from locals. Back in January, three of those sheriffs had documented sightings above energy infrastructure such as oil fields and power plants, CSD reported at the time.

The strange Wyoming sightings come nearly a year after similar drone hysteria in New Jersey was seemingly put to rest. Despite a huge mystery back in late 2024, president Donald Trump claimed tho drones were authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration for research.

Whether the same can be said for the Wyoming UFO mystery? That’s anyone’s guess.

            <div id="article-text">It’s all hands on deck at Meta, as the company develops new AI models under its superintelligence lab led by Scale AI co-founder, Alexandr Wang. The company is now working on an image and video model codenamed “Mango” along with a new text-based model internally known as “Avocado,” The Wall Street Journal reported.

The tech giant plans to release the new models in the first half of 2026, the publication said, citing an internal Q&A at Meta on Thursday, where Wang and chief product officer Chris Cox unveiled the new roadmap.

Wang had said Meta aims to make the text-based model better at coding while also exploring new world models that understand visual information and can reason, plan, and act without needing to be trained on every possibility.

Meta has more recently fallen behind its rivals, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, in the AI race. The company’s AI division saw significant restructurings this year, which included leadership changes and the poaching of researchers from other top companies. However, several of the researchers who joined Meta SuperIntelligence Labs (MSL) have already left the company.

Last month, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, also announced that he’s leaving to create his own startup.

Meta doesn’t have a winning AI product as of yet. Instead, Meta AI assistant’s numbers are buoyed by the company’s existing social networks spanning billions of users, since the company places the assistant in the search bar of its apps.

This means the first projects and models coming out of MSL will have a lot riding on them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Krafton, the South Korean gaming company behind hit titles such as PUBG and Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), is launching a growth investment fund focused on India, stepping up its push into the world’s largest internet user base.

Called the Unicorn Growth Fund, the investment vehicle is a collaboration between Krafton and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver, and investor Mirae Asset. It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.

The fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.

Naver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.

Krafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.

To date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content and fintech spaces. Recent investments include fintech Cashfree and venture fund IMM Investment, alongside earlier bets on gaming and content platforms such as Nodwin Gaming, Loco, Pratilipi, and Kuku FM. The company also launched a gaming incubator in India in 2023, and acquired a controlling stake in Indian gaming studio Nautilus Mobile for $14 million earlier this year.

Krafton’s expansion in India has not been without setbacks. New Delhi banned BGMI, the company’s flagship local title, in 2022, before allowing it to return in 2023 following a three-month trial approval. Krafton subsequently announced a $150 million investment commitment in the country.

BGMI, which has surpassed 240 million downloads, launched in 2021 as a revamped, localized version of PUBG Mobile, another popular title that was banned by the Indian government in mid-2020 over national security concerns. Since then, Krafton has made a series of operational changes in the country — including cutting ties with Tencent as its publisher and migrating its India servers to Microsoft’s Azure cloud — to address regulatory concerns.

With the new fund, Krafton is looking to extend its India strategy beyond gaming, channeling capital into a wider set of technology startups as it seeks to build a long-term presence in one of Asia’s fastest-growing digital markets.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, TechCrunch looks back at the cybersecurity horrorshows of the past 12 months — from the biggest data breaches to hacks resulting in weeks of disruption — to see what we can learn. This year, the data breaches were like nothing we’ve seen before.

Here’s our look back at some of the biggest security incidents of 2025, starting with:

The U.S. government remained one of the biggest targets in cyberspace. The year started with a brazen cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the U.S. Treasury, followed by the breaching of several federal agencies, including the agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. nuclear weapons, thanks to a SharePoint security flaw.

All the while, the Russian hackers were stealing sealed records from the U.S. Courts’ filing system, sending alarm bells ringing across the federal judiciary.

But nothing quite came as close as DOGE ripping through federal government departments and databases in what became the biggest raid of U.S. government data in its history.

The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE as it was widely known, led by Elon Musk and his band of private sector lackeys, violated federal protocols and defied common security practices. They ransacked federal databases of citizens’ data, despite warnings of the national security risks and conflicts of interests over Musk’s overseas business dealings. Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.

Musk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that they could face federal charges without his protection.

In late September, senior executives at American corporate giants began receiving threatening emails from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.

Months earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from dozens of organizations that rely on Oracle’s software.

Oracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was scrambling to patch the vulnerability. It was too late, though: the hackers had already stolen gobs of data from universities, hospitals and health systems, media organizations, and more.

This was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as GoAnywhere, MOVEit, and Cleo Software, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.

Salesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud.

Hackers targeted at least two companies, Salesloft and Gainsight, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce.

By breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, Linkedin, SonicWall and Verizon.

A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a data leak site advertising the stolen records in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.

Hackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from Marks & Spencer and at least 6.5 million customer records from the Co-op. The back-to-back hacks sparked outages and disruption across the retailers’ networks, and some grocery shelves went empty as the systems used to support the retailers were knocked out. Luxury store Harrods was also later hacked.

But a major cyberattack targeting Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s biggest employers, left a dent in the U.K. economy. A September hack and data breach saw JLR’s car plant stall production for months as the company worked to get its systems back up and running.

The fallout affected JLR’s suppliers across the U.K., some of whom went out of business altogether. The U.K. government ended up guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown.

U.K. security experts said the breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.

South Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.

The country’s largest phone company, SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a massive data center fire wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.

But the cherry on data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The data theft began in June, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the company’s chief executive resigning.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump, and the MAGA movement more broadly, have made two priorities very clear: They want fewer immigrants in America and more babies born to American mothers.

Those goals, however, are at odds. Millions of parents in the United States, native- and foreign-born alike, rely on immigrants to take care of their kids. (My toddler son has only ever been cared for by immigrant women, myself among them.) Immigrants make up at least 21 percent of the child-care workforce—and this may be an undercount. When fewer immigrants are in the American workforce, economic research suggests, women may work less or have fewer babies—possibly both.

In the first half of this year, Trump’s ICE agency made twice as many arrests as it did under the Biden administration during the same period last year. These efforts seem to have created a chilling effect, making many female immigrants scared to show up for work. According to a report from the New America Foundation published earlier this month, the arrests were associated with a loss of about 39,000 foreign-born child-care workers. Meanwhile, 77,000 U.S.-born mothers of kids under 5 dropped out of the workforce.

The study’s conclusion echoes past research by other scholars. A 2024 study found that Secure Communities, an Obama-administration program that led to hundreds of thousands of deportations, reduced the total number of day-care employees, in part by sparking fear among even documented immigrant workers. “Even if they are a legal immigrant,” Jessica Brown, an economics professor at the University of South Carolina’s business school and an author of the study, told me, “they may have family members who are not.” Brown estimates that during the Secure Communities era, 16,000 fewer people were working in child care and 1,700 fewer day cares were open than would have been otherwise. Brown theorized that lower-paid immigrant workers leaving the sector might have required child-care centers to bring in more higher-wage, native-born employees—“but maybe that’s not sustainable,” she said, “and so your center just closes instead.”

These reductions in the child-care workforce had a big impact on mothers, who are typically the parent to step in when a nanny or day care isn’t available. A study by Chloe East, an economist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and her co-authors found that Secure Communities was associated with mothers of young children becoming about 1 percent less likely to work—a small-seeming but significant decrease, when considering the 24 million working mothers in the U.S. East said she believes that this was because affordable child care became less available, given that a similar decrease was not seen among women without children or among fathers, who tend not to be the primary caregivers for young children.

Some researchers anticipate that the Trump administration’s ICE operations will affect immigrant child-care workers even more than Secure Communities did. “When we see ICE all over a city for a week, when we see them go to an apartment complex and try to knock on every single door,” East said, “that is a really new phenomenon at the scale that we’re seeing.” The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, estimated that if Trump succeeds in his goal of deporting 4 million people, employment in the child-care sector would shrink by about 15 percent, which would almost certainly make continuing to work more difficult for many mothers.

Perhaps this is what the MAGA movement wants: for American women to quit their jobs to stay at home with their kids. Several prominent MAGA figures, including Vice President J. D. Vance, have suggested parents do just that. But setting aside the fact that most mothers say they don’t want to do this, and that many working families cannot get by on only one income, making child care less available might not inspire working women to stay home. It could push them to have fewer kids.

The relationship between affordable child care and fertility is fuzzy; many countries with subsidized day care and other benefits for parents nevertheless have low birth rates. But some data suggest that as child care gets more expensive or less available, women have fewer kids. A recent working paper by Abigail Dow, an economics Ph.D. candidate at Boston University, found that higher child-care costs lead to lower birth rates and delay when mothers have their first child. When the price of child care for children under 3 increased by 10 percent, the birth rate of women ages 20 to 44 decreased by 5.7 percent.

Research has shown that after immigration restrictions loosened in the 1960s and the immigrant population grew, the price of child care decreased relative to what it likely would have cost otherwise. That seems to have led to more educated women having kids: A one percentage-point increase in immigrants to a given metro area was associated with a 0.3-percentage-point increase in the probability of highly educated women having had a child in the previous year. According to Delia Furtado, an economist at the University of Connecticut and the author of that study, these mothers might have been responding not only to the cost of child care but also to its convenience and quality.

If the president and his supporters see the tension between anti-immigration policy and pronatalist efforts, they haven’t acknowledged it publicly. MAGA world may talk about both issues a great deal, but deportations almost always win out. Immigration was one of the most important issues to Trump voters in 2024; pronatalism is much less popular as an issue, and the majority of Republicans say the government should have no role in encouraging people to have more kids. In a speech to Congress this year, Trump used the word border 21 times and the word children just 10. Joshua C. Wilson, a political scientist at the University of Denver who studies the conservative movement, told me, “Immigration is the lead-off issue that gets the attention of the base.” Pronatalism, by contrast, is “multiple rows behind.”

The authors of Project 2025 call “open-borders activism” a type of “cheap grace,” which they define as “publicly promoting one’s own virtue without risking any personal inconvenience.” By this definition, MAGA’s pronatalist rhetoric can also be considered cheap grace: a way for the president and his administration to throw red meat to social conservatives without needing to adjust their anti-immigration stance—or to pay up for parental leave or subsidized child care. In his first public address as vice president, Vance said it should be “easier to raise a family” in America. His administration’s immigration policies could make doing so much harder.</div>

            <h2>The Trump Administration’s Unintended Autism Experiment</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/leucovorin-autism-folate-trump/685312/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If President Donald Trump wanted Americans to take away one message about autism, it was this: Blame Tylenol. During his September press conference on the subject, Trump warned pregnant women more than a dozen times not to take the drug, even though two massive studies had found no meaningful association with the disorder in children. He also spread false rumors that “essentially no autism” can be found in Cuba or among the Amish. The other stated purpose of the event—the announcement of what FDA Commissioner Marty Makary called an “exciting treatment” for autism—was largely overshadowed by the president’s performance.

But parents of autistic children took note of that promised remedy. How could they not? Officials suggested that the little-known drug, leucovorin, could alleviate the symptoms of profound autism, perhaps allowing children with speech difficulties to find their words. Hundreds of thousands would benefit, according to Makary. No, it wasn’t a cure—officials stopped short of invoking that word—but it sounded like a miracle.

After the government’s endorsement, many parents rushed to get their hands on leucovorin. They soon discovered that they were effectively taking part in a nationwide experiment with few guidelines—assuming, that is, they could even get a prescription.

The theory behind treating autism with leucovorin is that the drug gives autistic kids something they’re missing. Children with autism seem to be more likely than other children to produce an antibody that prevents folate, also known as vitamin B9, from reaching their brain. Because folate plays a role in brain development, some researchers—most notable among them Richard Frye, a doctor who has been prescribing and promoting leucovorin for nearly two decades, and who told me he spoke with leaders in the Health and Human Services Department before the press conference—think these antibodies might hamper the growth of a child’s language abilities. Leucovorin is essentially a massive dose of folate, delivered in a form that can bypass those antibodies.

But that theory, which has long been debated in autism subreddits and Facebook groups, hasn’t gained traction among mainstream autism scientists. They point to a 2018 study that found that autistic children and their non-autistic siblings were equally likely to have these antibodies. The clinical evidence for leucovorin’s effectiveness for autistic kids is limited to a handful of small studies that don’t measure the same outcomes. No large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has ever been conducted. If you want to get the drug for autism, it has to be prescribed off-label, which many doctors refuse to do.

Part of the Trump administration’s promise was to make leucovorin more accessible to patients and easier for doctors to prescribe. So far, nothing official has happened. At the press conference, Makary promised that the FDA would change leucovorin’s label so that doctors could start prescribing it to kids with autism. But when the FDA formally laid out its leucovorin plan two days later, it made no mention of autism. The plan instead centered on cerebral folate deficiency, an extremely rare genetic condition. Emily Hilliard, an HHS spokesperson, wrote in an email that “the FDA’s current action is focused specifically on cerebral folate deficiency,” noting that some of its symptoms overlap with autism. (My other questions about the administration’s leucovorin rollout went unanswered.) A spokesperson for GSK, which originally manufactured the drug and controls the label, told me that the company submitted an application for the label change this week.

During the press conference, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, said that HHS would “help doctors treat children appropriately” with leucovorin. But Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, told me that physicians she’s spoken with have heard nothing from HHS. For her part, Halladay doesn’t believe that enough evidence exists to recommend leucovorin as an autism treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also said that the current data are lacking. In a statement, the organization allowed that if physicians prescribe the medication, they should work with families to monitor side effects; some parents report increased hyperactivity and aggression after their kids take leucovorin.

Several researchers I spoke with compared the excitement about leucovorin to the enthusiasm for secretin, another drug that was popular as an autism treatment in the 1990s after early promising results. More rigorous clinical trials later showed that it wasn’t effective. Halladay said she’s heard from multiple doctors, including her child’s pediatrician, that they’ve been besieged with calls from parents hoping to get a prescription. One doctor in Chicago told me he had received dozens of inquiries.

In the absence of official advice on leucovorin, parents—almost always moms—of kids with profound autism have been turning to one another for opinions and encouragement online.

Some post regular updates on TikTok and Instagram detailing their kid’s progress on leucovorin, saying they’ve noticed more regular eye contact, fewer repetitive movements and sounds, or improvements in language use. In the comments, fellow parents complain about not being able to get the drug (“My sons pediatrician refuses, wants us to just wait for prescribing guidelines”), ask questions about dosage (“I just gave her 15 mg today is that too much??”), and wonder whether it’s really working (“how do we know we see results, what do we see?”). Others say their child’s behavior didn’t improve—or even grew worse—after taking the medication (“I didn’t see it helping my son more with speech like we hoped”).

Some insist the drug must be paired with vitamin B12, omega-3, or a certain amino acid; others caution that dairy can reduce its effectiveness. Many want to know about an antibody test that purports to indicate whether a child’s brain is receiving enough folate. But that test isn’t widely accepted as valid, and not all doctors are willing to give it.

Jessie Carrasco is one of those TikTok moms. She lives with her husband and their three children on the outskirts of the east-Texas city of Tyler. Their oldest son, Ezra, is 11 and has autism. He didn’t talk until he was 4; she credits fish-oil supplements, in part, with helping him speak in short sentences and respond to simple questions. (Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil, may improve communication in autistic children, though the evidence is mixed.) When Carrasco invited me into their backyard, which was lively with chickens and dogs, Ezra ran up, gave me a quick once-over, and then darted off to play on the swing set with his younger brother.

Carrasco learned about leucovorin after hearing Trump refer to a new treatment for autism during his speech at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service. She emailed Ezra’s nurse practitioner, who was willing to prescribe it but didn’t know enough about the drug to offer advice on how much to give Ezra or how to deal with potential side effects. Since then, Carrasco has posted more than 200 videos on TikTok, most of them documenting Ezra’s progress on leucovorin. One clip shows him serving himself food from a pot on the stove—the first time he’d ever done that, she told me. Her video of Ezra before and after taking the drug has nearly 6,000 likes.

“Since we’ve been giving leucovorin, I think everything that we’ve been trying to teach, he’s started to get it more and faster,” she said. Ezra’s behavioral analyst, Margaret Hawkins, told me that before leucovorin, she used to work with Ezra on pronouncing single words; now she’s coaching him on telling three- or four-sentence stories.

Read: When America’s views on autism started to change

Without Kennedy and Trump, Carrasco might not have learned about leucovorin; she’s grateful to them for giving her more faith in Ezra’s future, and hopes that the progress she’s seen so far won’t turn out to be a mirage. At the same time, she’s frustrated by the lack of information about how to use the drug and the difficulty she and other parents have had getting their hands on it. “I feel like they presented something and then just kind of left it in the dust,” she said. The last time she checked, the pharmacies in Tyler were out of leucovorin; she was planning to drive to a neighboring town to get more. “I got my hopes up and now I’m nervous,” she texted me recently. “I don’t wanna watch him regress.”

If the posts and comments are any indication, even parents who have managed to get prescriptions, like Carrasco, have been having trouble filling them. Whether the drug is in shortage now is unclear, but it has a history of supply problems going back more than a decade. A drug-shortage database maintained by a pharmacists’ association recently listed leucovorin shortages at five companies. (One of them, Teva, said its 25-milligram pills were in stock, but not its 5-milligram dose; the others either didn’t respond to me or couldn’t confirm whether they had supply issues.)

Perhaps because of shortages—or difficulties finding a doctor willing to prescribe leucovorin at all—some parents are turning to supplemental forms of folate. Such supplements are far less potent than leucovorin, but are usually cheaper and don’t require a prescription. (Even if leucovorin does turn out to be an effective autism treatment, it’s unknown whether low-dose supplements would have any effect.)

Offline, parents have been calling Frye, the longtime leucovorin doctor, who believes that as many as 1 million kids could benefit from the drug. He mostly treats children with significant language delays, though he says that the drug can sometimes help higher-functioning kids too. Frye was the lead author of a small 2016 study that found that children with autism who received leucovorin showed improvements in verbal communication, compared with those given a placebo; he also recently published a book called The Folate Fix. Ever since the press conference, his office has been inundated with calls and emails from parents who want the drug for their children.

Read: RFK Jr.’s cheer squad is getting restless

For years, Frye has had a backlog of patients wanting to see him, but the White House announcement, he told me, made an “impossible situation worse.” He already has about 1,000 patients who are taking leucovorin, and he isn’t planning to accept any new ones until 2028. According to Frye, the FDA has asked him to submit an application to conduct clinical trials on leucovorin as an autism treatment, but last week, he told me that “not much is going on at this time.” He guesses those trials will take about two years. In the meantime, parents will be left to experiment with leucovorin on their own.</div>

I look forwards to the posts where because Apple is not an absolute monopoly they are somehow immune to any accusations of anti-trust.

No one would ever sign up to such insane terms if Apple wasn&#39;t in such a powerful position that they could dictate such terms. In other words, their position and size in the market is such that they can enforce things that no one would be able to do without that kind of size, regardless of product quality.

Them demanding this is 100% confirmation that anti trust action is entirely warranted.

A bit telling is that they seem to give themselves discretion of the fee amount, which implies that they believe they have some sort of proper accounting for how many external purchases made and what their amounts were.

How would they even do that in the US? The injunction explicitly denies apple the means of tracking this. Might be the same in other jurisdictions as well.

You still think that you have to have a monopoly, absolute or otherwise, to violate antitrust law?

I&#39;m quite sure Apple will  NEVER  make a &quot;mistake&quot; in collecting fees it believes it&#39;s due from developers, or those that produce apps they really, really don&#39;t want on the market but can&#39;t otherwise remove.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get moderated down for expressing my opinion that I do not like Apple, never have, and consider them about as welcome as a bad case of the clap. I&#39;ve a few corporations that I absolutely detest, not because of their tech, but because of their arrogance. Bad tech abounds, and is frequently t

So, this is Apple saying that they can arbitrarily make up a number that they believe is a developer&#39;s income from an app, then charge them fees based on that vapor-based number, rather than charging based on actual revenue generated?

Can&#39;t wait to see which court is the first to give them a legal beating for this nonsense.

I don&#39;t think Apple has to make anything up. Since the purchase of the app, plus in-app sales have to be reported to Apple*, they know what you make. As it stands now, Apple is the IRS of their own walled garden.

What will you do about it? Nothing, as usual.  You whine and complain Russia is doing this to you, yet you do nothing in return.

Either punch the bully in the teeth with brass knuckles or stop complaining you&#39;ve been attacked.

As Ukraine has shown, taking the fight to the bully is the only way to get results.

No, it doesn&#39;t. Russia has shown they have a veto power through European courts over what happens to that money. Belgium and Italy gave it to them when they decided they fear Russia more than they like Ukraine. A few other countries in Europe are similarly weak-kneed.

The money the Europeans just approved for Ukraine is a loan and it is backed by the EU. They make reference to the Russian money and say that they will wait two years for Russia to pay reparations....which they know won&#39;t happen. The threat is that the EU will come for the money in two years but Russia known that is an empty threat. And Russia doesn&#39;t have to worry about Putin&#39;s Poodle, the alleged U.S. president, backing the EU.

Denmark would have to do it through NATO. The problem with that is the U.S. has a Putin Poodle as an alleged president and hence NATO cannot rely upon the U.S. to back them up. Even Putin himself says that Europe is out of step with a Moscow-friendly U.S. So the current U.S. will cede Russian hegemony over Europe, and el Bunko will laugh all the way to the bank. It will be a few years before the price for that capitulation by the U.S. becomes apparent, but that will be after el Bunko is gone and his Maggots

They are free to defend themselves without NATO and then they are free to get squashed like a bug by Russia because the U.S. and NATO won&#39;t be behind them.

erm ... the us and nato have been trying to beat russia for nearly 4 years now. spoiler: it isn&#39;t going well. europe in this context is just a rabid chihuahua digging its own grave, and denmark is irrelevant.

It&#39;s not so simple though since Russia (like a little bitch) constantly threatens with it&#39;s nuclear arsenal.  It&#39;s a bitch move because they, Europe and the world knows if they did not have that nuclear threat they would have easily been pushed out of Ukraine by now.

It&#39;s easy to say oh Denmark can just go it alone when they have to face the choice to their people and Europe and the world of &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, Putin is probably bluffing, only like a 15% of nuclear strikes!&quot;

Hell, their forces aren&#39;t even up to taking Ukraine, they&#39;ve had to bring in mercs from afar.

As Ukraine has shown, taking the fight to the bully is the only way to get results.quite impressive results: get your country wrecked, losing probably a 40% of it, over a million casualties, several million people fleeing the country (most not to ever return), bankruptcy and nearly all energy infrastructure and industry wiped out, and the grim prospect of ceasing to exist as a viable nation state.was playing the nato game worth it? i can imagine a lot of other actions that would have led to very different outcomes.

I don&#39;t blame the average Russian for Putin invading Ukraine any more than I blame myself for Trump attacking Venezuela. Or any of the literally dozens of other outright illegal or just obviously bullshit things the US has done during my lifetime.

I don&#39;t care about America and if you are an American you should blame yourself, after all, he is your guy in power.

As to ruzzians, these are zombie cocroaches that allowed their dear leader to be in power for the last 25 years because they are all on the dole and their sense of national pride is above any level of human morality.

In the past year, a short video was pinned to the social media feed of Chabad Rabbi Eli Schlanger, of Sydney. In that video, filmed last Hanukkah, Schlanger steps out of his home, smiling, announcing: “Here’s the best response to combat antisemitism!” As a song—“Just a Little Bit of Light”—plays, he lifts a large menorah from his car, fastens it onto the roof, lights it, and dances beside it, out in the street. It is a moment of joy, confidence, and trust in the idea that anyone facing bigotry can bring their full self into the public square. This year, at a Hanukkah gathering at Bondi Beach, Schlanger was murdered together with another 14 Jews who had assembled to publicly celebrate the holiday.

Schlanger’s video and his killing point to a question that reaches beyond the Jewish community: Who is able to bring their full identity into public civic life, and what does that say about the society in which we live?

For minority groups—religious, ethnic, racial—public visibility is not merely expressive. It is a measure of belonging. The ability to appear as oneself in shared civic spaces signals confidence that one’s neighbors see that expressed identity as legitimate, accepted, and safe. When visibility becomes dangerous, it is not simply an indication that the minority community is at risk. It’s a sign that the social contract itself has begun to fray.

This is not a theoretical or faraway concern for Americans. As Yair Rosenberg reported in the Atlantic this month, recent surveys show that the generation now coming of age in the United States reflects levels of hostility toward Jews unmatched in any other recent generation. In a 2024 survey of nearly 130,000 Americans, one-quarter of voters under 25 reported an “unfavorable opinion” of Jewish people—with negligible differences between left and right. The Yale Youth Poll found an identical pattern: Younger respondents were dramatically more likely to say that Jews have “too much power” or a “negative impact” on the country.

Across polls, the same curve appears again and again—age, not ideology, is now the strongest predictor of anti-Jewish sentiment. This is not about fringe extremists. It is about the cohort that will shape campuses, media, technology, politics, and public norms in the coming decades. By default, then, this is the cohort that determines Jewish safety in public spaces. Notably, the killers at Bondi Beach were a 24-year-old man and his father.

This all matters because public space is not neutral. It is built and maintained by the people who inhabit it. If younger Americans increasingly view all Jews with suspicion, then the simple act embodied in Schlanger’s video—a Jew standing visibly and joyfully as a Jew—will become harder, not easier, to express in the next generation. His murder forces us to confront the dangers Jews face today, not just in Australia but in the shifting American landscape that now forces us to ask who will feel safe tomorrow.

Jews have been grappling with the relationship between visibility and belonging for generations. In 1978 Rabbi Joseph Glaser, a Reform leader, argued that Jewish rituals should remain confined to private property. Public space, he insisted, should be religiously neutral—a buffer protecting minorities from majoritarian dominance. His approach reflected an era in which safety seemed to lie in discretion.

The Chabad movement, of which Schlanger was a part, came to wider prominence in Judaism under the leadership of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson in the last half of the 20th century and argued the precise opposite: Jews should not disappear themselves, and public religious expression strengthened both Jewish identity and America’s pluralistic character. A menorah in the public square was not a breach of neutrality but a sign that the country belonged equally to all.

These were not theological disagreements. They were different assessments of a democratic society’s capacity to welcome difference. Glaser’s caution and Schneerson’s confidence each assumed something radically different about the U.S.: its norms, its protections, its willingness to embrace or merely tolerate Jewish presence.

Neither view alone determines whether Jews feel safe in public. That depends on society.

Minority visibility is not a minority decision. It is a majoritarian responsibility.

When Jews can gather openly, when they can sing and celebrate without fear, it signals that the country’s commitments—to equality, pluralism, and mutual care—are holding. When they cannot do so, it indicates the opposite—and not just for one group alone.

Only one year ago, Schlanger believed he could answer hatred with light. He believed that public joy was not only permissible but meaningful. His belief did not fail. Society failed him. And that failure raises broader questions: Who gets to feel safe while visible? Whose identities are treated as unexceptional in public life? Which communities must negotiate their presence as a risk?

These questions become even more pressing when set against the growing antisemitism among young Americans. It is tempting to read these trends as destiny, but they are not. Prejudice is not merely a matter of sentiment; it is shaped by the norms that a society chooses to reinforce or neglect. These shifts do not simply describe a generational change—they pose a civic challenge. If belonging in public space can erode, it can also be rebuilt. The responsibility lies not only in confronting hatred, but in strengthening the democratic norms that make visibility safe in the first place.

A healthy democracy does not ask its minorities to calculate whether they can appear as themselves in shared spaces without risking their safety, or even their lives. It does not demand that visibility be balanced against survival. When that comes into question, it signals that something deeper is unsettled: that the norms meant to protect the vulnerable have weakened, and that belonging itself has become conditional.

The burden of ensuring Jewish safety—or in fact the safety of any minority—should never fall on the minority alone. It belongs to all of us. History has taught Jews to protect themselves when others won’t. But the real measure of a society is whether it makes that instinct unnecessary.

Schlanger’s final message remains clear: People flourish when they are able to stand fully as themselves. The question his murder forces upon us is whether the countries Jews call home will choose to affirm or deny that possibility.

It’s hard to put numbers behind what feels like a rise in antisemitism in American political discourse. But people are trying. Back in 2024, a Democratic pollster named David Shor released some polling data from more than 100,000 voters. He said he found that a quarter of those younger than 25 held an “unfavorable opinion” of Jewish people. That sentiment plummeted with age, but Isaac Saul has started to wonder if this is a warning—especially because of how younger people are getting their information online and from far-right influencers.

“I think what people miss is just how ubiquitous it is,” says Saul, who writes the Tangle newsletter and is Jewish. “Everybody talks about Nick Fuentes or Candace Owens and they’re the superstars, but there are dozens, hundreds of other people who are ‘smaller’ that still have bigger platforms than me.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Saul about why antisemitism is everywhere and how to confront it. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How worried are you about antisemitism right now? From a scale of 1 to 10?

Isaac Saul: I would say pretty worried. And it’s changed pretty seriously. If you asked me this question three years ago, I would have said −3. I was somebody who laughed at and mocked my mom or grandmother for seeing antisemitism everywhere. I was always telling them “Nobody cares about the Jews anymore.” But then I started to experience it.

I would get soft antisemitism, like people making Jew jokes or stuff that I could laugh at. And now I’m experiencing stuff that I don’t think is funny.

We’re speaking this week of this attack at Bondi Beach in Australia. I’m curious if you put these fears together, the fear of an attack and the fear about what you’re talking about now, which is more of a creeping rhetorical antisemitism that seems to be on both sides of the political spectrum in the United States. And what I’m so concerned about in this moment is something almost gentler, a creeping sense, especially among young people, that something is off with Jews or Judaism. What do you think?

I can’t get over just how ridiculous it feels that we’re having this conversation in 2025. I do think that that’s a smart distinction. But I also lend some credence to the view that has been expressed by some Jews and Zionists after this attack that this is why chanting “Globalize the intifada” sends a chill up some people’s spine. When I see college students doing that at Columbia’s campus, I don’t think they’re going to shoot up a beach in Australia. But it’s also true that what just happened in Bondi Beach is, to many people, what globalizing the intifada looks like. This is why a lot of Jews want to nip that rhetoric in the bud. They want to hear Zohran Mamdani condemn it. They seek that because they fear this. And it justifies the fear for a lot of them, and I don’t blame them for feeling justified.

You have drawn a line between true believers in antisemitic beliefs and Gen Z converts. Can you just tell me more about what that line is?

There are actual 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22-year-old kids who are asking, “Why are there so many Jews in finance? I don’t get it.” And nobody’s answering the question, which there’s an actual sensible answer to that question, so then they’re going to fill the gaps with the answers that they’re getting on YouTube. If they’re not allowed to ask that question in school, if they’re not allowed to ask that question to their parents, if they are not to ask that question to Jewish friends, then they are going to go ask it on Reddit, or 4chan. And they’re going to get a very different answer than they would have gotten from a Judaic studies teacher at their college.

If that’s not something you can raise your hand and ask in a college classroom—which it is not, it is a very taboo thing to say—then you’re not going to do it, and you’re going to turn to the other sources that kids use to get information these days. There’s a really good argument for making that kind of stuff a little bit less taboo so we can fill in those gaps for people.

For centuries, Jews were considered less than, and Christians were prohibited from doing things like money lending because that was viewed as an immoral job. So they gave it to the Jews, and because they were second-class citizens, that was the only job available to them, because they couldn’t own land, and they weren’t allowed to be part of trade networks. They started making money, and it turned out being a money lender was actually a pretty good profession. That’s the actual story, which makes total sense, which you can explain to somebody, but only if they’re allowed to probe it and hear it.

But I think some people would say, “Once you say, ‘Yes, but,’ ” you’re letting the bad idea in. People may not listen, right?

We have to stop acting like we have something to hide. That’s my point. Somebody says, “Six percent of Congress is Jewish. We’re only 2 percent of the population.” Go us, we did it! And if you’re asking me for an explanation, I can give you an explanation that’s about the history of education in the Jewish community. The great Jewish diaspora required us to be really literate so we could keep studying our religious texts while not having a synagogue that we could go to because all you guys bombed and burned them and committed a bunch of pogroms and ran us off. There is a historical explanation for why Jews have high literacy rates or are going to school and university at high rates in the mid-19th century.

There’s an interesting moment in your writing where you basically say, “It was always going to come to this.” You essentially make the argument that no matter what happens, there is this durability to antisemitic beliefs. And there are so many things that even in the current moment are being blamed on Jewish people.

You can think about that in a couple ways. You can think of it as like, “OK, it was always going to happen.” That’s really depressing. Or, “We’ve always known that this is going to be on all of us to keep explaining why this is wrong.” What do you think?

I really reject the framework that Jews shouldn’t have to do the work. It’s part of the anti-racist framework too, that Black people shouldn’t have to do the work, and they need white allies. There’s always been something a little bit problematic with that. Yes, they need allies, but also the people who need to hear it the most often need to hear it from the people that they think they hate the most.

It is literally what all the evidence suggests. If you go look at how deradicalization groups work, how people get pulled out of being in neo-Nazism or white nationalist groups, almost every single one of these guys has stories along the lines of how they had a Jewish boss who was really nice to them when their mother died.

We don’t really have the choice. The option is we sit back and let it be whatever, or we say, “Actually, we’re going to be part of the solution. We’re going to fight the rising tide.” And some of that’s going to be killing them with kindness. Some of that is going to be aggressively trying to defend against misinformation and nonsense and conspiracies. And some of that is just by being a good person in your existence as somebody who is part of the ethnicity.

I think it’s hard to do all that when you’re scared. And I think a lot of American Jews are scared right now. What would you say to them?

First of all, I would say we are the majority—not the literal Jews, but the good people. We are the majority. I know it doesn’t feel that way, but we’re the ones who actually have the strength in numbers. This isn’t the normie thing to view this stuff this way, to hate Jews. The average person you meet on the street, the odds of them being a Jew hater are not better than them liking Jews. Exist in the world with that confidence.

And fear is not a productive feeling to embrace and swim in. I’m not a particularly brave person, but I don’t think you’d have to be brave to walk around with this mentality. You just have to have the confidence that we don’t have anything to hide. We have a history and a story about our people that we know, that we can learn, that we tell, that we can communicate, that there are more good people out there than bad people.

When I put on a yarmulke and go to Shabbat services, and I’m walking a mile to my synagogue in Philadelphia, I’m not thinking about, Oh my God, I hope nobody sees me in my yarmulke and they do something terrible to me. I’m thinking, I’m a Jew who’s representing as a Jew. And I’m representing all Jews walking down the street right now, so I better be a good fucking person. I smile at people, and I say hi. I am an ambassador for my people right now in this little neighborhood in South Philly, where maybe there’s a bunch of antisemites—probably not, but if I run into one tonight on accident and I am really nice to him, maybe it will have an impact on his worldview. I think that is a more empowering, productive, helpful way to live your life than just looking around for ghosts at every corner and being scared of what’s going to happen to you next.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Already £1.4 billion over budget and four years late, a tech transformation project at a UK state-owned bank is outside HM Treasury spending limits and timetable under a revised plan from systems integrator Capgemini.

Speaking to MPs this week, Dax Harkins, chief executive of National Savings and Investments (NS&I), said he could not guarantee the troubled project would not be hit by further setbacks requiring the extension of a contract with incumbent supplier Atos, which is due to end in 2028.

&quot;We are working through the first version of the integrated plan we hoped would give us that [assurance]. I can tell you now that [plan] goes beyond March 2028 and it goes beyond our cost profile, and we are working to improve that,&quot; he told the Public Accounts Committee, a Parliamentary public spending watchdog.

&quot;I think we&#39;ve got some real options that will help to do that and do it in a considered and thoughtful way to still get the outcomes that we want. But we&#39;ve got to do that work to validate [it].&quot;

Harkins said NS&I, which handles £240 billion in customer investments, has the capacity and the resources to deliver the plan on budget when it is finalized.

&quot;We&#39;ve got some options to bring that [cost] in that we&#39;re working through at the moment. Until we&#39;ve done all of that work, we won&#39;t know exactly where that takes us. But HM Treasury have been really clear. We need to get an option to work within the budget. We just don&#39;t know the makeup of that,&quot; he said.

Earlier this year, the National Audit Office, a public spending watchdog, slammed the NS&I transformation program, which includes new customer-facing technology and a new banking engine.

In 2020, NS&I began a business transformation program called Project Rainbow, which aimed to reduce the bank&#39;s running costs, make NS&I a self-service digital business, and replace its 20-year outsourcing deal with Atos by splitting the work into five separate contracts.

In 2014, the bank awarded Atos a new contract to run until 2021, and then extended it until 2024 and again until 2028 without competition, handing the French outsourcer another £474.4 million. The total cost of the program is expected to hit £3.0 billion until 2030-31, including its contract with Atos and other running costs. The total cost increase is set for £1.3 billion compared to the 2020 business case, the NAO said in November.

Matthew Smith, the transformation program&#39;s senior responsible owner, said Capgemini – which was awarded the £48 million SI contract in July – had worked with NS&I and the program&#39;s other suppliers to pull the integrated plan together.

&quot;We have never had that before,&quot; he said.

Among the proposals under consideration to cut costs and speed up the program was cutting the step of building a new website and mobile app linked to the legacy banking application. &quot;It&#39;s one of the initiatives that we&#39;re looking at to bring that plan forward to actually not incur that nugatory cost and time of building to the legacy, but to build to the new capabilities of the new banking engine first,&quot; he said.

The NAO report [PDF] points out that the replacement of the core banking engine &quot;carries an extremely high level of risk.&quot;

As well as being the incumbent supplier for the legacy system, Atos was awarded a £474.4 million ($612 million) contract without competition to build systems including modernizing the core banking engine, as well as running payment, reporting, and business-to-business services from 23 December 2024 until 31 March 2028.

NS&I had originally gone to market to kick off the competition for a new core banking, payments and reporting system, which together with business-to-business services for government payments was worth £480.3 million over nine years.

In a procurement note, the government-owned bank said that the award was made to Atos without competition because &quot;as the incumbent service provider Atos and its key sub-contractor(s) are the providers of the existing NS&I core banking platforms, which rely on interdependent leveraged technology and resources.

&quot;The process of dis-aggregating these at the same time as building and deploying a new core banking instance would be sufficiently complex that it can only be practicably carried out by Atos IT Services UK without very significant disruption to NS&I customers,&quot; it said.

Smith told MPs that the Atos contract has the option for an additional one-year extension, although NS&I would need to &quot;take approvals before we can exercise that option.&quot;

&quot;And there&#39;s a further period beyond that for transition assistance,&quot; he said.

Since its relationship with Atos (previously Siemens) began in 1999, NS&I can look forward to a 30-year relationship with the French outsourcer with no end currently in sight. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new pearOS distro is a Romanian project that picks up the concepts behind the original Pear Linux from 2011 and updates them. It&#39;s not going to turn the distro world upside down, but it&#39;s fun, interesting, and a showcase for the versatility and customizability of the Linux desktop.

Pear Linux was a French distro by David Tavares, based on Ubuntu and GNOME but heavily themed with custom fonts, icons, menu layouts, and more, all intended to make it visually resemble Apple&#39;s Mac OS X as closely as possible. As DistroWatch records, it went through some seven releases between 2011 and 2013, before Tavares announced that an unnamed company had bought it, and the distro vanished. Some contemporary reviews of PearOS 3.0 (2012), PearOS 7.0, and PearOS 8.0 (both 2013) – especially their screenshots – will give you an idea of how well it accomplished that. The idea has enduring appeal. After it disappeared, there were attempts to revive it, including Pearl Linux and Clementine OS, both in 2014, but neither got far.

pearOS is back, replacing Ubuntu with Arch and GNOME with the latest KDE Plasma

Over a decade later, a young Romanian developer called Alexandru Balan has released a new pearOS distro, rebuilt on a new basis of Arch Linux and the latest KDE Plasma 6.5.4. The release announcement calls this basis NiceC0re, and as the screenshots there show, this pearOS is styled to look like this year&#39;s macOS 26 &quot;Tahoe.&quot;

This is more than just a custom theme slapped onto a default KDE Plasma setup. There&#39;s a working global menu bar, with a pear menu in place of an apple menu at top left. This contains a single-column Settings app, which resembles the iOS style Settings app of macOS 13 Ventura and above. Within is an optimistic array of macOS-like features, many of which, such as Focus Mode, don&#39;t open and instead display:

This feature is currently not available. Please check back later for updates.

There&#39;s a Pear Piri option (in place of Siri) with a Pear Intelligence feature, the desktop is called &quot;Pinder,&quot; there&#39;s a pCloud section, and &quot;Wallet and Pear Pay,&quot; and so on. We certainly can&#39;t fault the ambition here. Since quite a bit of its functionality is yet to be implemented, it&#39;s a good thing that this is in addition to KDE&#39;s standard System Settings app.

Rather than KDE&#39;s Dolphin file manager, it uses the GNOME Files app, but most of the accessories are KDE ones: the Kate text editor, Discover app store, and so on. It ships with Flatpak installed, but no Flatpak apps. The default browser is the latest Firefox, and there&#39;s no office suite, just KWrite.

It&#39;s not a lightweight distro. It takes about 12 GB of disk and 1.2 GB of RAM at idle. The installation medium&#39;s boot menu offers a choice of using the latest Nvidia drivers, or FOSS drivers. With the latter, it was able to bring up the second screen on our testbed ThinkPad W520, although it&#39;s attached to a long-unsupported GPU. We weren&#39;t able to install it on that machine, though.

The installer is custom and one of the more unfinished areas of the distro. It comes up with a choice of just three languages: Romanian, Czech, or English. However, selecting them won&#39;t help you, as there is no Next or Continue button. It took us considerable experimentation to determine that the only way to get the button to display was to press the Tab key to move the selection, and then a big right-facing arrow became visible. This quickly revealed a very significant limitation. Much like that other FOSS macOS-like, the Hello System, the installer will only let you select a whole drive. There&#39;s no way to dual-boot with another OS unless you have two separate physical drives – and we could tell that this was unexpected, because when we tried again on another machine with two SSDs, the icon for the second appeared completely off the bottom of the installer window and floating over the desktop. It doesn&#39;t show its best under VMs either.

With that hiccup overcome, it installed fine and ran well. It uses X11 rather than Wayland and adding a user account is postponed until post-installation like in Fedora.

From the project&#39;s GitHub page, it looks to have been under construction for several years, and we found traces on the Internet Archive of several earlier versions of this restarted project. Even so, there are a number of sections in the Settings app that clearly aim to resemble Apple features that Linux doesn&#39;t really do just yet.

Compatibility-wise, it&#39;s Arch with the latest KDE. Pretty much everything you could want is here or in the AUR repository. Functionally, it&#39;s KDE, but it&#39;s a lovely and very functional take on KDE. Appearances are of course subjective, but The Reg FOSS desk isn&#39;t fond of any of the modern themes or looks included with KDE, and it lacks anything as simple as Xfce&#39;s Panel Profiles to load different desktop layouts with a single click. It&#39;s a bit of fun in the bleak midwinter (for those of us in the northern hemisphere). We rather like it. ®

            <div id="article-text">Hewlett Packard Enterprise has told customers to drop whatever they&#39;re doing and patch OneView after admitting a maximum-severity bug could let attackers run code on the management platform without so much as a login prompt.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-37164 and rated a maximum 10.0 on the CVSS scale, affects HPE OneView versions 5.20 through 10.20 and allows unauthenticated remote code execution, according to an advisory published by the company this week. OneView sits at the heart of many enterprise environments, serving as a central control plane for servers, firmware, storage, and lifecycle management.

&quot;A potential security vulnerability has been identified in Hewlett Packard Enterprise OneView Software,&quot; HPE said in its advisory. &quot;This vulnerability could be exploited, allowing a remote unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution.&quot;

HPE said the issue was reported by security researcher Nguyen Quoc Khanh and is urging customers to either upgrade to OneView 11.0 or apply the emergency hotfix immediately. Separate fixes are available for the OneView virtual appliance and for HPE Synergy deployments.

Rapid7, which has analyzed the vulnerability and the vendor&#39;s hotfix, told The Register that the real danger isn&#39;t just code execution, but where it happens. OneView is typically deployed deep inside the network with sweeping privileges and minimal scrutiny, because it&#39;s assumed to be trustworthy. An unauthenticated RCE at that layer doesn&#39;t just open a door – it hands over the keys to the building.

In other words, popping OneView could give an attacker centralized control over large chunks of infrastructure at scale, rather than access to a single compromised box. That makes it a far more attractive target than the average edge-facing server bug.

Rapid7&#39;s initial inspection of the hotfix suggests the vulnerability is tied to a specific REST API endpoint exposed by the appliance. The fix works by blocking access to that endpoint at the web server level, and the firm said it has a high degree of confidence that this endpoint is the primary access vector.

HPE has not said whether the flaw is being actively exploited, but history suggests bugs like this don&#39;t stay theoretical for long. Highly privileged management platforms are often targeted by ransomware crews and other attackers seeking shortcuts past perimeter defenses.

For now, if you&#39;re running a vulnerable version of OneView, patch or upgrade immediately. Rapid7, meanwhile, suggests defenders treat the issue as an assumed-breach scenario, review network segmentation, and stop treating infrastructure management layers as untouchable. ®

Although our phones are all equipped with cameras, there is still something special about being able to immediately produce a printed photo to pass around or give as a gift. If that’s something that appeals to you, the Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 instant camera is a great gift idea, and it’s now on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for about $73.99 (down from $93.99), nearly matching its all-time low of $73.

We picked it as our overall best instant camera for most people due to its relatively high image quality, handy twist-to-zoom lens, and a larger-than-average viewfinder, which will make it easier to take the perfect photo. It’s not perfect, of course — for one thing, you can’t disable the flash — but if you want to experience the joys and problems of simple print photography, this is a good choice.

Be aware, however, that unless you plan to pick it up at your local Target, you may not get it in time for Christmas. You should be able to take photos of your New Year’s celebration, though.

Many of the best Switch 2 controllers work fine on the original Switch, too.

The Switch 2 is here, and Nintendo seems ready to move on from the original Switch. But we’re not going to up and forget about it. That’s why we’ve kept testing controllers that might be a good fit for you. Even as many accessory makers are making controllers with the Switch 2 in mind, most of the resulting gamepads to come out also work just fine on the original Switch.

In terms of any differences between Switch and Switch 2 controllers, there are fewer than you might think; there may be a GameChat button on it that’ll serve no purpose until you eventually upgrade to a Switch 2, but that’s an easy thing to overlook.

The options below are great for many types of gamers. However, if you’re looking for newer (and cheaper) options than the ones listed below, I strongly suggest that you visit our guide to the best Switch 2 controllers. Of that batch, Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller is the only Switch 2 controller released so far that won’t work on the original Switch. The rest that we’ve included do. We don’t plan to make substantial changes to the article below.

There are some things that are worth knowing if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it may not support HD rumble, it probably won’t have NFC for Amiibo, or be able to wake the Switch remotely. However, there are some exceptions, which we feature below.

If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller (even though its $10 price increase in mid 2025 still hurts). It’s one of very few gamepads to include every feature mentioned above, and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers to use that we’ve tested. However, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and Max each offer more exhaustive customization at lower prices, and the Hori Split Pad Compact is a Joy-Con upgrade for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller and DualShock-esque Pro 3 controller, both of which are great in different ways if you don’t mind spending close to the cost of Nintendo’s first-party model.

We test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters like Overwatch 2. We pay attention to how everything feels — buttons, triggers, analog sticks, the D-pad — noting whether anything seems off.

Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz? Ideally (but not always), a controller we recommend is compatible with other platforms, too.

Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?

Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macro settings? Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?

Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?

High quality, sturdy buildSupports HD rumble, gyro motion, and NFCLong battery lifeMobile and PC compatibility

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes (but not the Switch 2)

Ever since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is one of an elite few wireless options that includes good rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also one of a few controllers we’ve tested that can remotely turn on the Switch without being plugged into it. It’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although, it can’t wake the new console from standby— you’ll need a Switch 2 Pro Controller for that, or one of the several third-party options included in our guide to the best Switch 2 controllers).

The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.

Hori’s Joy-Con alternatives offer a roomier, comfier grip for your Nintendo Switch in handheld mode without the added bulk of its Split Pad Pro version. They also feature two customizable rear buttons and are offered in multiple colors and designs, but do not support rumble or Amiibo figures.

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch OLED / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No

I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re very comfortable. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Compact can probably help out a bit.

The Split Pad Compact is a — you guessed it — a more compact alternative to the Split Pad Pro, which has unfortunately become tougher to find at a reasonable price. Similarly, it comes in a variety of colorways, and it adds some comfort to using the Switch in handheld mode. One slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides more grip than Joy-Con do, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast-paced gameplay, or to stay comfy over longer play sessions.

The Split Pad Compact doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Compact Attachment that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment usually (but not always) costs somewhere close to the amount of Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned features. It does add a 3.5mm headphone jack when plugged in via USB to the Switch’s dock, however.

Great ergonomics with Xbox-style shapeDeep customization optionsHall effect sticks and triggersSupports HD rumble, NFC, and motionWide platform compatibility

Supported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes (only in KK3 Max) / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes

On the surface, the KingKong 3 Max is similar to the last-gen models it replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features.

But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. It has Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, with physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. This model has GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).

Additionally, it features detachable rear-facing paddles. You get four long, curved paddles with the KK3 Max that match the contour of its rear grips. They are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge.

Ergonomically similar to the Switch Pro controllerUses durable TMR sticksWirelessly compatible with mobile and PCShake to wake Switch and Switch 2

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Android, macOS, Apple devices / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, including Switch 2

8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller is a minor step forward compared to the first iteration, but it comes with new features you might care about. It still feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. As for what’s changed internally, you’re getting more durable TMR joysticks, plus two new mappable buttons near the triggers (totaling four customizable buttons). Speaking of the triggers, they’re adjustable thanks to new switches that can alter how much you have to pull them to register an input. It’s particularly great for first-person shooters or action games where speed is paramount.

Its haptics are decent in some games, but not nearly as good as Nintendo’s HD Rumble, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch and Switch 2 by giving the controller a little shake. It’s a nice value compared to the Switch Pro, as well as most other third-party options because it also includes a charging dock with an integrated 2.4GHz transmitter.

The Ultimate 2 controller comes in two variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model for Switch owners because it’s the only version that’s compatible. Additionally, it’s compatible with the Switch 2, the Steam Deck, PC, macOS computers, and a slew of other Bluetooth-ready devices. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity, in case you need a more reliable connection for compatible devices.

Includes charging dock and 2.4GHz dongleHighly customizableParticularly comfortable for small-handed gamers

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, and more / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, including Switch 2

The 8BitDo Pro 3 is the company’s latest high-end controller. On its face, the biggest difference between it and the similarly-priced Ultimate 2 is its PlayStation DualShock-esque stick layout, which alone might enough to convince some gamers to get it. The Pro 3 improves on its predecessor by featuring swappable buttons that can be detached with its included magnetic suction tool. With it, you can go from the Nintendo layout to the Xbox layout. Otherwise, this model’s internal specs and compatibility are very similar to that of the Ultimate 2.

The Pro 3 features TMR joysticks, plus Hall effect triggers with switches that toggle between full pulls or shorter clicks for either trigger. Just like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 has four customizable buttons that can be assigned almost any other button, or combination of buttons, through the company’s Ultimate V2 app on PC or by pressing certain buttons together, as listed in the manual. Additionally, the controller supports turbo mode.

Compared to most other Switch controllers, the Pro 3 stands out due to its PlayStation-style layout of D-pad and sticks. You may prefer this model if you play a lot of retro games that prioritize the D-pad, which is more easily accessible than on most other Switch controllers. One other fun perk of the Pro 3 is its swappable joystick caps. Two arcade stick-like knobs are included that make certain games feel more rewarding to play, such as fighting games.

InexpensiveAllows you to use nearly any Bluetooth controller

There are a few other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s is the best value. Instead of spending $80 on a Switch Pro controller, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn most Bluetooth controllers you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock (or directly into the console if you have a USB-A to USB-C adapter) and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model we’ve linked to.)

To our delight, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.

If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.

We like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).

We tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.

We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($44.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.

I encourage anyone who’s searching for a new Switch controller to check out The Verge’s buying guide for the best Switch 2 controllers. All of the options it includes (except for Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro) work on the original Switch, not just the Switch 2, and we’ve focused on highlighting affordable, yet capable options. In the guide, you’ll find out about the EasySMX S10, the Mobapad N1 HD, and other controllers that have almost as many features as Nintendo’s pricier Switch 2 Pro for far less. We’re also testing new models for potential inclusion in the future.

Rapid advances in AI and robotics are set to become both powerful tools for police and potent weapons for criminals, a 48-page report from pan-European police agency Europol argues. Earlier this month, Europol’s Innovation Lab published “The Unmanned Future(s): The impact of robotics and unmanned systems on law enforcement.” The document is framed as more of a “foresight” exercise than a hard prediction. It sketches the near future of 2035, where intelligent machines are everywhere, from homes, hospitals, and factories to police stations, shops, and schools.

Researchers from The Hague-based organization, effectively an EU-version of the global police agency Interpol, imagine hypothetical scenarios such as widespread resentment over job losses and automation bubbling over into civil unrest, “bot-bashing,” and populist riots demanding society “put people first.” Another outlines emerging questions like whether people will eventually see hitting a robot as some form of abuse — an argument that’s already broken out several times over robot dogs — that, left unresolved, could create tensions between police and the public.

“… we have to ask ourselves how criminals and terrorists might use drones and robots some years from now.”

On the other side, Europol’s predictions suggest that the future’s ubiquitous robots will be perpetrators of crime, too. Care robots, such as those used in hospitals or the homes of disabled or elderly people, could be hijacked to spy on families, harvest sensitive information, and even manipulate victims or groom children. Autonomous vehicles or drones could also be hacked, the report warns, leaking sensitive data or being used as a physical weapon. Swarms of drones, possibly scavenged from war zones like Ukraine, the report envisions, could be used by terrorists to attack cities, by rival gangs to fight over territory with homemade explosives, or by other bad actors to monitor police activity and gain an edge over law enforcement.

The report continues in an increasingly theoretical manner, suggesting that future robots are likely to give police a tough time. “Questioning” them could be a nightmare, and the researchers warn it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish “between intentional and accidental behaviour” when bots behave badly, noting the difficulties police already face in crashes involving driverless cars. The researchers imagine police seizing rogue robots with “RoboFreezer guns” and using “nets with built-in grenades” to snare drones won’t end the threat. Once inside police facilities, robots might “record, steal, destroy or escape,” the researchers say.

As far-fetched as some of these predictions sound, Europol doesn’t think they’re that far off the mark with their vision for 2035. An unnamed Europol spokesperson told The Telegraph the agency “can’t predict the future” but did try to “anticipate plausible future scenarios that enable us to make more informed decisions today.” Europol did not respond to The Verge’s request for an interview.

“If you have a policeman that barely uses equipment like a drone, you can’t compete with a skilled enemy.”

The signs are already here, the researchers say. Smugglers of drugs and other contraband already use drones and autonomous vehicles in their operations — prisons are a frequent target and, remember the Starlink-equipped narco submarine? — and terrorists are showing signs of doing the same. There’s also a growing market of drone pilots advertising their skills to criminals online, the report claims. Increased funding for training and education in relevant areas, access to the latest technology, and a shift “from 2D to 3D policing” (on account of drones) will be needed for police to keep up with criminals in the future, the report recommends.

Catherine De Bolle, Europol’s executive director, writes:

“The integration of unmanned systems into crime is already here, and we have to ask ourselves how criminals and terrorists might use drones and robots some years from now. Just as the internet and smartphones presented significant opportunities as well as challenges, so will this technology. Our new report by Europol’s Innovation Lab explores the future operating environment for European law enforcement agencies and suggests actions needed today in order to effectively combat crime while upholding public trust and fundamental rights tomorrow.”

Robotics experts The Verge spoke to were less certain about the kind of rapid uptake Europol’s researchers imagine, or that the technology itself is the main problem. Martim Brandão, a lecturer in robotics and autonomous systems at King’s College London, says it’s certainly plausible to imagine issues like surveillance and blackmailing surrounding hacked care or home robots given their sheer numbers and reliance on the internet. Similar incidents have already occurred. “I’m not as confident about the other predictions,” he says, such as terrorist attacks using scavenged drones or violent human responses to machine automation, explaining that he’s not aware of the evidence supporting the claims.

Giovanni Luca Masala, a roboticist and lecturer in computer science at the University of Kent in England, says “predictions about the year 2035 are difficult” given the speed at which new technology is being developed. Adoption is not just about the technology, either, he says. It also “depends also on the market, the cost, the ability to produce en masse,” all of which could prevent the kind of robotic uptake imagined in Europol’s report.

That said, Masala says he agrees with the overall recommendations of Europol’s researchers. “One way or another, criminals will use any kind of new technology,” he says, adding that society needs to invest in police equipment and training for AI, robotics, and cybersecurity. “Because if you have a policeman that barely uses equipment like a drone, you can’t compete with a skilled enemy.”

But for all the speculation about how police and criminals might use robots in the future, Brandão thinks Europol’s report overlooks one of the most important issues we’re going to face: holding police accountable. “The report talks about the potential for exploitation of privacy and security issues of home robots by potential criminals, which I agree with, but they don’t talk about the potential for police forces themselves to invade privacy and exploit or create security vulnerabilities.” Given the “numerous cases of police misconduct and discriminatory surveillance,” it’s vital to consider those risks as well, he says. “I’m more concerned about police and intelligence agencies exploiting robot vulnerabilities than terrorists, especially given the ongoing authoritarian shifts across the world.”

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.
