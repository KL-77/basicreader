            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known-good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some of have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased, but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/randomly-quoting-ray-bradbury-did-not-save-lawyer-from-losing-case-over-ai-errors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frustrated by fake citations and flowery prose packed with “out-of-left-field” references to ancient libraries and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a New York federal judge took the rare step of terminating a case this week due to a lawyer’s repeated misuse of AI when drafting filings.

In an order on Thursday, district judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations.

One of those filings was “noteworthy,” Failla said, “for its conspicuously florid prose.” Where some of Feldman’s filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically.

It featured, the judge noted, “an extended quote from Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and metaphors comparing legal advocacy to gardening and the leaving of indelible ‘mark[s] upon the clay.’” The Bradbury quote is below:

“Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”

Another passage Failla highlighted as “raising the Court’s eyebrows” curiously invoked a Bible passage about divine judgment as a means of acknowledging the lawyer’s breach of duty in not catching the fake citations:

“Your Honor, in the ancient libraries of Ashurbanipal, scribes carried their stylus as both tool and sacred trust—understanding that every mark upon clay would endure long beyond their mortal span. As the role the mark (x) in Ezekiel Chapter 9, that marked the foreheads with a tav (x) of blood and ink, bear the same solemn recognition: that the written word carries power to preserve or condemn, to build or destroy, and leaves an indelible mark which cannot be erased but should be withdrawn, let it lead other to think these citations were correct.

I have failed in that sacred trust. The errors in my memorandum, however inadvertent, have diminished the integrity of the record and the dignity of these proceedings. Like the scribes of antiquity who bore their stylus as both privilege and burden, I understand that legal authorship demands more than mere competence—it requires absolute fidelity to truth and precision in every mark upon the page.”

Although the judge believed the “florid prose” signaled that a chatbot wrote the draft, Feldman denied that. In a hearing transcript in which the judge weighed possible sanctions, Feldman testified that he wrote every word of the filings. He explained that he read the Bradbury book “many years ago” and wanted to include “personal things” in that filing. And as for his references to Ashurbanipal, that also “came from me,” he said.

Instead of admitting he had let an AI draft his filings, he maintained that his biggest mistake was relying on various AI programs to review and cross-check citations. Among the tools that he admitted using included Paxton AI, vLex’s Vincent AI, and Google’s NotebookLM. Essentially, he testified that he substituted three rounds of AI review for one stretch reading through all the cases he was citing. That misstep allowed hallucinations and fake citations to creep into the filings, he said.

But the judge pushed back, writing in her order that it was “extremely difficult to believe” that AI did not draft those sections containing overwrought prose. She accused Feldman of dodging the truth.

“The Court sees things differently: AI generated this citation from the start, and Mr. Feldman’s decision to remove most citations and write ‘more of a personal letter&#39;” is “nothing but an ex post justification that seeks to obscure his misuse of AI and his steadfast refusal to review his submissions for accuracy,” Failla wrote.

At the hearing, she expressed frustration and annoyance at Feldman for evading her questions and providing inconsistent responses. Eventually, he testified that he used AI to correct information when drafting one of the filings, which Failla immediately deemed “unwise,” but not the one quoting Bradbury.

Feldman is one of hundreds of lawyers who have relied on AI to draft filings, which have introduced fake citations into cases. Lawyers have offered a wide range of excuses for relying too much on AI. Some have faced small fines, around $150, while others have been slapped with thousands in fines, including one case where sanctions reached $85,000 for repeated, abusive misconduct. At least one law firm has threatened to fire lawyers citing fake cases, and other lawyers have imposed other voluntary sanctions, like taking a yearlong leave of absence.

Seemingly, Feldman did not think sanctions were warranted in this case. In his defense of three filings containing 14 errors out of 60 total citations, Feldman discussed his challenges accessing legal databases due to high subscription costs and short library hours. With more than one case on his plate and his kids’ graduations to attend, he struggled to verify citations during times when he couldn’t make it to the library, he testified. As a workaround, he relied on several AI programs to verify citations that he found by searching on tools like Google Scholar.

Feldman likely did not expect the judge to terminate the case as a result of his AI misuses. Asked how he thought the court should resolve things, Feldman suggested that he could correct the filings by relying on other attorneys to review citations, while avoiding “any use whatsoever of any, you know, artificial intelligence or LLM type of methods.” The judge, however, wrote that his repeated misuses were “proof” that he “learned nothing” and had not implemented voluntary safeguards to catch the errors.

Asked for comment, Feldman told Ars that he did not have time to discuss the sanctions but that he hopes his experience helps raise awareness of how inaccessible court documents are to the public. “Use of AI, and the ability to improve it, exposes a deeper proxy fight over whether law and serious scholarship remain publicly auditable, or drift into closed, intermediary‑controlled systems that undermine verification and due process,” Feldman suggested.

“The real lesson is about transparency and system design, not simply tool failure,” Feldman said.

But at the hearing, Failla said that she thinks Feldman had “access to the walled garden” of legal databases, if only he “would go to the law library” to do his research, rather than rely on AI tools.

“It sounds like you want me to say that you should be absolved of all of these terrible citation errors, these missed citations, because you don’t have Westlaw,” the judge said. “But now I know you have access to Westlaw. So what do you want?”

As Failla explained in her order, she thinks the key takeaway is that Feldman routinely failed to catch his own errors. She said that she has no problem with lawyers using AI to assist their research, but Feldman admitted to not reading the cases that he cited and “apparently” cannot “learn from his mistakes.”

Verifying case citations should never be a job left to AI, Failla said, describing Feldman’s research methods as “redolent of Rube Goldberg.”

“Most lawyers simply call this ‘conducting legal research,’” Failla wrote. “All lawyers must know how to do it. Mr. Feldman is not excused from this professional obligation by dint of using emerging technology.”

His “explanations were thick on words but thin on substance,” the judge wrote. She concluded that he “repeatedly and brazenly” violated Rule 11, which requires attorneys to verify the cases that they cite, “despite multiple warnings.”

Noting that Feldman “failed to fully accept responsibility,” she ruled that case-terminating sanctions were necessary, entering default judgment for the plaintiffs. Feldman may also be on the hook to pay fees for wasting other attorneys’ time.

The hearing transcript has circulated on social media due to the judge’s no-nonsense approach to grilling Feldman, whom she clearly found evasive and lacking credibility.

“Look, if you don’t want to be straight with me, if you don’t want to answer questions with candor, that’s fine,” Failla said. “I’ll just make my own decisions about what I think you did in this case. I’m giving you an opportunity to try and explain something that I think cannot be explained.”

In her order this week, she noted that Feldman “struggled to make eye contact” and left the court without “clear answers.”

Feldman’s errors came in a case in which a toy company sued merchants who allegedly failed to stop selling stolen goods after receiving a cease-and-desist order. His client was among the merchants accused of illegally profiting from the alleged thefts. They faced federal charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, as well as New York charges, including fostering the sale of stolen goods.

The loss triggers remedies, including an injunction preventing additional sales of stolen goods and refunding every customer who bought them. Feldman’s client must also turn over any stolen goods in their remaining inventory and disgorge profits. Other damages may be owed, along with interest. Ars could not immediately reach an attorney for the plaintiffs to discuss the sanctions order or resulting remedies.

Failla emphasized in her order that Feldman appeared to not appreciate “the gravity of the situation,” repeatedly submitting filings with fake citations even after he had been warned that sanctions could be ordered.

That was a choice, Failla said, noting that Feldman’s mistakes were caught early by a lawyer working for another defendant in the case, Joel MacMull, who urged Feldman to promptly notify the court. The whole debacle would have ended in June 2025, MacMull suggested at the hearing.

Rather than take MacMull’s advice, however, Feldman delayed notifying the court, irking the judge. He testified during the heated sanctions hearing that the delay was due to an effort he quietly undertook, working to correct the filing. He supposedly planned to submit those corrections when he alerted the court to the errors.

But Failla noted that he never submitted corrections, insisting instead that Feldman kept her “in the dark.”

“There’s no real reason why you should have kept this from me,” the judge said.

The court learned of the fake citations only after MacMull notified the judge by sharing emails of his attempts to get Feldman to act urgently. Those emails showed Feldman scolding MacMull for unprofessional conduct after MacMull refused to check Feldman’s citations for him, which Failla noted at the hearing was absolutely not MacMull’s responsibility.

Feldman told Failla that he also thought it was unprofessional for MacMull to share their correspondence, but Failla said the emails were “illuminative.”

At the hearing, MacMull asked if the court would allow him to seek payment of his fees, since he believes “there has been a multiplication of proceedings here that would have been entirely unnecessary if Mr. Feldman had done what I asked him to do that Sunday night in June.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open source packages published on the npm and PyPI repositories were laced with code that stole wallet credentials from dYdX developers and backend systems and, in some cases, backdoored devices, researchers said.

“Every application using the compromised npm versions is at risk ….” the researchers, from security firm Socket, said Friday. “Direct impact includes complete wallet compromise and irreversible cryptocurrency theft. The attack scope includes all applications depending on the compromised versions and both developers testing with real credentials and production end-users.”

dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that supports hundreds of markets for “perpetual trading,” or the use of cryptocurrency to bet that the value of a derivative future will rise or fall. Socket said dYdX has processed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume over its lifetime, with an average trading volume of $200 million to $540 million and roughly $175 million in open interest. The exchange provides code libraries that allow third-party apps for trading bots, automated strategies, or backend services, all of which handle mnemonics or private keys for signing.

The npm malware embedded a malicious function in the legitimate package. When a seed phrase that underpins wallet security was processed, the function exfiltrated it, along with a fingerprint of the device running the app. The fingerprint allowed the threat actor to correlate stolen credentials to track victims across multiple compromises. The domain receiving the seed was dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site, which mimics the legitimate dYdX service at dydx[.]xyz through typosquatting.

The malicious code available on PyPI contained the same credential theft function, although it also implemented a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allowed the execution of new malware on infected systems. The backdoor received commands from dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site. The domain was registered on January 9, 17 days before the malicious package was uploaded to PyPI.

Socket said the packages were published to npm and PyPI by official dYdX accounts, an indication that they were compromised and used by the attackers. dYdX officials didn’t respond to an email seeking confirmation and additional details.

The incident is at least the third time dYdX has been targeted in attacks. Previous events include a September 2022 uploading of malicious code to the npm repository and the commandeering in 2024 of the dYdX v3 website through DNS hijacking. Users were redirected to a malicious site that prompted them to sign transactions designed to drain their wallets.

“Viewed alongside the 2022 npm supply chain compromise and the 2024 DNS hijacking incident, this [latest] attack highlights a persistent pattern of adversaries targeting dYdX-related assets through trusted distribution channels,” Socket said. “The threat actor simultaneously compromised packages in both npm and PyPI ecosystems, expanding the attack surface to reach JavaScript and Python developers working with dYdX.”

Anyone using the platform should carefully examine all apps for dependencies on the malicious packages listed above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After writing two November stories analyzing price expectations for Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine, I really didn’t think we’d be offering more informed speculation before the official price was revealed. Then Valve wrote a blog post this week noting that the “growing price of… critical components” like RAM and storage meant that “we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing” for the living room-focused PC gaming box.

We don’t know exactly what form that “revisiting” will take at the moment. Analysts who spoke to Ars were somewhat divided on how much of its quickly increasing component costs Valve would be willing (or forced) to pass on to consumers.

“We knew the component issue was bad,” DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole told Ars. “It has just gotten worse. “

How much worse has the pricing situation gotten for Valve since November? Superdata Research founder and SuperJoost newsletter author Joost van Dreunen suggested that the 512GB Steam Machine model would probably run $50 to $75 more than he expected when the Steam Machine was announced, and to expect a price “potentially $100+ above target” for the high-end 2TB model. That would mean a $599 to $629 price at the low-end and $849 to $899 for the high-end model, in his estimation.

Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter agreed that, even with the additional component costs, Valve would likely “try to get it out at $599 or so for the 512GB version,” A starting price higher than that would mean “abysmal” sales, he added. “I think $700 is a death sentence and $1,000 is unsellable.”

Other analysts think that Pachter’s “unsellable” price for the Steam Machine is increasingly plausible now, though. DFC’s Cole said possible prices for the Steam Machine are now “approaching $1,000,” with the 512GB model perhaps $100 less than 2TB model. But F-Squared analyst Michael Futter expected an even bigger gap between the two models, saying the 512GB model “could crest $1,000” and the 2TB model would likely fall somewhere in the $1,300 to $1,500 range.

On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.

Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.

F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”

The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.

That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.

“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”

So, if Valve is forced to significantly increase the asking price of the Steam Machine, does that mean significantly fewer people will be willing to buy it? Not necessarily. DFC’s Cole said that this kind of gaming hardware already has “a fairly niche built-in audience that will not be too price sensitive.”

Van Dreunen agreed that the Steam Machines’ “core audience, PC gamers who want a living room setup without the hassle of a full build, will absorb a $50 to $100 price increase without much hesitation.” But that core audience might not be very large; Pachter said that, even with a $599 starting price, the Steam Machine would “likely sell no more than 5 million [units].” At a higher starting price, he saw total sales going down quickly.

The analysts who spoke to Ars agreed that recent price increases for every major game console gave Valve a little more competitive breathing room regarding pricing. But the relative price difference between Valve and the other console makers will still matter, they said.

“While Valve may have been aiming to price its Steam Machine in line with the PS5/Xbox Series X|S at one point, or potentially undercut it, it’s now clear that the company may have to price it above these competitors,” Ahmad said. “At a time when multiple competitors exist on the market, we believe the higher price will limit the audience for the Steam Machine going forward.”

Futter agreed that whichever company could offer the lowest-cost machine that could plausibly offer 4K, 60 fps performance in most modern games (as the Steam Machine is targeting) would reap great benefits in the market. But even if the Steam Machine isn’t cheaper than competing high-end consoles, Futter said Valve’s hardware would appeal to those who “want to get into [high-end] PC gaming and can’t absorb $2,500+ for access to the Steam ecosystem.”

In the end, how Valve handles Steam Machine pricing might depend on whether the company wants to “expand SteamOS beyond the enthusiast base and into territory currently held by PlayStation and Xbox,” as Van Dreunen put it. “The memory cost shock doesn’t threaten Valve’s ability to sell to its existing audience. It threatens the pace at which it can grow a new one.”</div>

            <h2>COVID-19 cleared the skies but also supercharged methane emissions</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/covid-19-cleared-the-skies-but-also-supercharged-methane-emissions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the spring of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic brought global industry and travel nearly to a halt, satellite sensors recorded a dramatic plunge in nitrogen dioxide, a byproduct of internal combustion engines and heavy industry. For a moment, the world’s air was cleaner than it had been in decades.

But then something strange started happening: methane, the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, was surging. Its growth rate hit 16.2 parts per billion that year, the highest since systematic records began in the early 1980s. A new study published in the journal Science looked at the complex chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest region of the atmosphere) and found that the two changes are likely connected.

Since the late 1960s, we knew that atmospheric methane doesn’t just vanish. It is actively scrubbed from the sky by the hydroxyl radical, a highly reactive molecule that breaks down methane, turning it into water vapor and carbon dioxide. “The problem is that the lifetime of the hydroxyl radical is very short—its lifespan is less than a second” says Shushi Peng, a professor at Peking University, China, and a co-author of the study. To do its job as an atmospheric methane clearing agent, a hydroxyl radical must be constantly replenished through a series of chemical reactions triggered by sunlight. The key ingredients in these reactions are nitrogen oxides, the very pollutants that were drastically reduced when cars stayed in garages and factories went dark in 2020.

When nitrogen oxide levels plummeted by approximately 15 to 20 percent globally during the 2020 lockdowns, the production of the hydroxyl radical slowed to a crawl. Without enough of these to go around, methane molecules that would have normally been destroyed remained in the atmosphere for longer. Peng and his colleagues estimate that the reduction in this methane sink accounted for approximately 80 percent of the massive spike in the methane growth rate seen in 2020. The cleaner our air became, the longer the methane stuck around to warm the planet.

The remaining question, though, was where all this methane was coming from in the first place. Throughout the pandemic, there was speculation that the surge might be caused by super-emitter events in the oil and gas sector, or perhaps a lack of maintenance on leaky infrastructure during lockdowns.

But the new research suggests that the source of these emissions was not what many expected.

While the weakened atmospheric sink explained the bulk of the 2020 surge, it wasn’t the only factor at play. The remaining 20 percent of the growth, and an even larger portion of the growth in 2021 and 2022, came from an increase in actual emissions from the ground. To track the source of these emissions down, Peng’s team went through tons of data from satellites and various ground monitoring stations.

Methane comes in different isotopic signatures. Methane from fossil fuels like natural gas leaks or coal mines is heavier, containing a higher fraction of the stable isotope carbon-13. Conversely, methane produced by microbes found in the guts of livestock, in landfills, and most notably in wetlands, is lighter, enriched in carbon-12.

When the researchers analyzed data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration global flask network, a worldwide monitoring system tracking the chemical composition of Earth’s atmosphere, they found that the atmospheric methane during the mysterious surge was becoming significantly lighter. This was a smoking gun for biogenic sources. The surge wasn’t coming from pipes or power plants; it was coming from microbes.

The timing of the pandemic coincided with a relatively rare meteorological event. La Niña, the cool phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation that typically leads to increased rainfall in the tropics, lasted for three consecutive Northern Hemisphere winters (from 2020 to 2023). This made the early 2020s exceptionally wet.

The researchers used satellite data from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite and sophisticated atmospheric models to trace the source of the light methane to vast wetland areas in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia. In regions like the Sudd in South Sudan and the Congo Basin, record-breaking rainfall flooded massive swaths of land. In these waterlogged, oxygen-poor environments, microbial methanogens thrived, churning out methane at an accelerated pace.

Peng and his team found that tropical African and Asian wetlands alone were responsible for roughly 30 percent of the global methane emissions increase during the 2020–2022 period.

Methane is often touted as the low-hanging fruit of climate policy because it has a shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide. For a long time, we thought that if we stopped the infrastructure leaks and other methane emissions today, the atmosphere would clear relatively quickly. But the study done by Peng and his colleagues shows that things might not be that simple. There are two major challenges we must face to solve the methane problem, and both are largely outside of direct human control.

First, there is the threat of climate feedbacks. If warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns cause a boost in natural wetland emissions, we may find ourselves in a race against a biological source that we cannot simply turn off. The second challenge, arguably even harder to overcome, is the clean air paradox that emerges from the results of Peng’s study.

As we transition away from fossil fuels and improve urban air quality, nitrogen oxide levels will naturally decline—an unequivocal win for public health. But the atmosphere’s natural capacity to scrub methane will also decline.

That’s a piece of science that’s almost sure to get hopelessly distorted in our maelstrom of conflicting politics. Because it means all the coal power plants, V8 cars, and private jets actually purge a greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere, right?

“Not really, because everyone needs clean air,” argues Peng. “It means that we must reduce anthropogenic methane emissions.” If it’s just to compensate for a cleaner atmosphere with less hydroxyl radicals, we’re likely going to need even more aggressive reductions than we previously thought. “I think that’s the only choice for the policy makers,” Peng adds.

            <h2>Professor Says Her Garbled AI Textbook Was a Huge Success</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The professor behind an AI-generated textbook says that her error-ridden experiment was actually a resounding success.

Designed for a comparative literature course on medieval and Renaissance-era writing and announced by UCLA at the end of 2024, the digital textbook was immediately met with widespread mockery and derision from educators. Its AI-generated cover was riddled with incomprehensible text — “Of Nerniacular Latin To An Evoolitun On Nance Langusages,” for example — and featured generic visuals that had little to do with the period it was supposedly covering.

At the time, Elizabeth Landers, a grad student who helped put together the volume, said that the errors “aren’t a failure of AI.” Instead, she argued, “they’re an intentional artistic choice that prompts students to question their assumptions about language, meaning and historical truth.”

Now in a new interview with Inside Higher Ed in which the word “hallucination” isn’t mentioned once, the course’s professor Zrinka Stahulja called her decision to use an “AI-assisted” textbook a “no-brainer” because of all the time it saved her, helping her be an “approachable and accessible teacher.”

And incredibly, Stahuljak says she was surprised that her UCLA colleagues were so skeptical about her AI textbook. “I was really shocked that they couldn’t see that this textbook was my creation; it was carefully edited, just as if it had been printed,” she told IHE.

“I don’t see how a traditional textbook that costs $250 and is out of date within two years or three years, would be in some way better than a custom $25 AI-facilitated textbook that is based on my material,” she added.

The AI textbook was made with Kudu, a platform for creating digital textbooks started by another UCLA professor. Stahuljak says she created the textbook by supplying her own notes to the AI tool, which was instructed not to pull from outside sources. Students could interact with a built-in chatbot to help learn the materials, though she stresses it was designed not to write papers or complete assignments. Stahuljak also says the AI features made the book more accessible, with some students saying they listened to it while walking or at the gym.

After deploying the AI textbook, Stahuljak claimed that “engagement went up” compared to classes that didn’t use it. And perhaps soberingly, she viewed it as a preferable to having her students turn to ChatGPT for help.

“It’s better than some commercial version that has nothing to do with what you’re teaching or is pulling the information from the internet,” she said in the interview. “We’re losing that control when we are indiscriminately given ChatGPT or other commercial generative AI-powered tools.”

There’s a fair point or two being made, but Stahuljak isn’t addressing the numerous elephants in the room. AI chatbots are notorious for generating made-up facts and otherwise incorrectly reporting information, regardless of whatever data they’re being asked to pull from. A considerable and still growing body of evidence shows how AI tools may diminish critical thinking skills and attention spans. Then there’s the broader concerns over how the tech is threatening the very existence of learning institutions, as tech companies spend millions of dollars to capture schools and universities and use them to offload their products.

“This is truly bad and makes me wonder if we aren’t participating in creating our own replacements at the expense of, well, everyone who cares about teaching and learning,” one English professor wrote on social media after the AI textbook was announced, as quoted by IHE.

“If you do this you should have your doctorate revoked and be thrown into the stocks at the center of the main university quad,” fumed another professor. “This is abandonment of professional responsibility to a degree that would be comical if it weren’t so self-serious.”

            <div id="article-text">After an analyst found that users are losing money faster on sites like Polymarket than on traditional sports gambling platforms, the US’s largest prediction market Kalshi hit back with a decidedly unusual response.

As Bloomberg reports, the betting platform told it that the analysis was part of an “extortion plot” by the startup that had collected the data, Juice Reel — before, even more puzzlingly, backing off from the stunning claim.

The report was conducted by Jordan Bender, an equity research analyst at the bank Citizens. Using Juice Reel’s data, it found that in the first three months, users on prediction markets like Kalshi were losing more money than on traditional gambling sites like FanDuel and DraftKings, in proportion to the amount of money they wagered.

If true, the findings put a considerable dent in prediction markets’ self-styled image as a more cerebral form of betting, allowing customers to place wagers on a variety of real-world events, ranging from presidential elections to natural disasters to military interventions. And because bettors are competing against each other, instead of the house, these sites claim that means users have a more reliable way of making money.

Though they’re essentially dressed-up casinos, they also seek to be seen as an authority on the future itself. Last month, for example, Kalshi partnered with CNN to provide real time prediction data on its broadcasts. Polymarket announced a similar partnership with Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, barely a week later. These add heft and credibility to their projections, even though Kalshi’s and Polymarket’s projections are entirely determined by users’ bets.

Of course, if Kalshi and similar services are just as much as a money sink as plain old gambling, then that elevated veneer vanishes. And they appear to: Bender found that the bottom quarter of users lost about 28 centers of every dollar they put on the lane, compared to just 11 cents per dollar on traditional gambling hubs.

Kalshi’s tried-and-true defense against these claims? Calling the data “flat-out wrong,” it said in a statement to Bloomberg. Its head of communications Elisabeth Diana accused Juice Reel of having a conflict of interest because it sought “investment support” from Kalshi in the past. She also claimed that Juice Reel’s founder offered to “defuse the situation” if he was given a meeting with Kalshi’s CEO.

“Please consider the source and its motives,” she told Bloomberg in an emailed statement. “This is extortion.”

Juice Reel’s CEO Ricky Gold tells it differently. “They called and messaged us, pressuring us to tell Bloomberg that our data is inaccurate,” Gold told the publication. “We stand for transparency, we stand for helping bettors, traders understand their activity across the platform, and we stand behind our data.”

Kalshi continued to dispute the findings and denied pressuring Gold, per the reporting. But it’s now changed its tune on the whole alleged blackmail angle. “We are in ongoing discussions about Juice Reel’s legal ability to obtain our data, but after further review, we don’t believe the intention was extortion,” the company said in an updated statement last week.

The touchy response from Kalshi also comes amid increasing calls to regulate prediction markets after several scandals captured national attention. The most significant came in January, when a slew of traders on Polymarket placed sizable bets on the prediction that US forces would enter Venezuela just hours before Trump launched the operation to capture the country’s leader Nicolas Maduro. One “lucky” bettor made more than $400,000.

            <h2>Novo Nordisk Furious at $49 Knockoff Ozempic Pill</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/novo-nordisk-ozempic-knockoff-pill">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Novo Nordisk conquered the world with its borderline miraculous drug semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy. But with a sinking stock price and compelling alternatives eating its lunch, it’s now finding itself in a position in which it has to take desperate measures to fight off its competitors.

On Thursday, the Danish pharmaceutical giant vowed to take legal action against Hims & Hers after the telehealth company announced a much more affordable knockoff of its weight loss pill, Wegovy— which it’s offering starting at $49 for a month’s supply, though the price subsequently jumps to $99.

“The action by Hims & Hers is illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety,” Novo said in a statement, per CNBC. “Novo Nordisk will take legal and regulatory action to protect patients, our intellectual property and the integrity of the US gold-standard drug approval framework.

“This is another example of Hims & Hers’ historic behavior of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs.”

It remains to be seen if the lawsuit materializes. But Novo probably felt it had to say something to save face. Immediately after Hims announced its Wegovy knockoff on Thursday, the pharma giant’s shares plunged by nearly 8 percent.

Luckily for Novo, they’re now back up by over 5 percent, after its big brother came to the rescue: later that same day, the US Food and Drug Administration made its own vow that it would crack down on “illegal copycat drugs.” With the script now flipped, Hims’ stock nosedived by ten percent in after-hours trading, per Reuters, and as of today, is down by over 2 percent.

What Hims is offering is what’s known as a compounded form of a drug, which are made by pharmacies using their own ingredients, rather than being made by the pharmaceutical company. They’re different from generic versions of a drug, which are approved by the FDA. Compounded drugs are largely unregulated and receive no FDA approval, but are far cheaper than buying the brand name.

The practice of compounding drugs allows a pharmacist to tailor a drug to a patient’s specific needs, but big pharma companies view it as a loophole that lets copycats sell cheap knockoffs. At one point, Novo claimed that some one million Americans were taking semaglutide knockoffs, and appealed to the US government to ban imports of some of the key ingredients copycats used to formulate their versions of the drug.

The increased competition comes after a disastrous years-long spell for Novo, which was once the most valuable company in Europe. US rival drugmaker Eli Lilly overtook prescription for Wegovy with its Zepbound weight loss shot — which, to rub salt in the wound, also performed better in a head-to-head trial. It didn’t help that Novo’s offerings were prohibitively expensive before it eventually slashed them last summer, at one point costing more than $1,000 per month for customers without insurance. The perception of its weakening grip on the throne saw Novo’s stock collapse by over 50 percent year over year in 2025, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in value.

And its worst days may still be ahead. On Wednesday, Novo said it expected sales to fall this year, the New York Times reported, which would be its first annual decline in sales in nearly a decade. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly said it expected its sales to keep growing, nudging its market cap back above the $1 trillion mark.

Novo’s saving grace is that it beat Lilly to the punch with a pill version of Wegovy, released in January. Pill versions are seen as the next big steep for weight loss drugs, as they’re cheaper and less intimidating than shots. Its CEO Mike Doustdar claimed that the Wegovy pill is selling 15 times faster in its first month that than the injectable version on its debut, per the NYT. But this advantage may soon vanish too, as Lilly expects to release its own pill later this year.

            <h2>Investors Concerned AI Bubble Is Finally Popping</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For quite some time now, investors have fought the suggestion that the artificial intelligence industry may be forming a massive bubble, risking an eventual collapse of epic proportions that could take down the US economy with it.

But shaking off those fears has proven increasingly difficult as the tech stock market reels from a major selloff this week.

Amazon shares tumbled nine percent Friday morning after claiming that its spending would hit an astronomical $200 billion this year as part of its efforts to keep up in the ongoing AI race. Shares are down over eight percent over the last five days, indicating it’s not just a blip.

Microsoft has been hit hard lately as well, with shares also plunging almost eight percent over the last five days, following its biggest single-day loss since the pandemic last week.

Other tech companies, including AI chipmaker Nvidia, Oracle, Alphabet, and Meta, all saw their shares drop significantly this week as they indicated they remained committed to spending vast sums to scale up their AI infrastructure investments.

As CNBC reports, around $1.35 trillion in valuations has been wiped out as Big Tech companies committed to spending a total of $660 billion this year alone, a “breathtaking” figure, as AllianceBernstein head Jim Tierney told the Financial Times.

But it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to figure out that investors are becoming incredibly antsy about those enormous spending plans. A short-term return on investment for AI-focused infrastructure buildouts is certainly out of the question as tech leaders continue to reassure them that it will all be worth it in the end.

The selloff could mark the beginning of a much larger downturn, analysts fear.

“Questions over the extent of [capital expenditures] as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,” GAM Investments investment director Paul Markham told CNBC.

With its $200 billion spending target, a significant 56 percent increase over last year, Amazon has positioned itself as the biggest spender. Yet the stock tumble indicates it’s not what investors wanted to hear.

“We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race,” Quilter Cheviot consumer discretionary analyst Mamta Valechha.

Further adding credence to the theory that investors are getting spooked by the enormous amount of money companies are continuing to pour into AI is Apple, whose far more muted approach appears to have paid off — with its shares instead up a whopping seven percent since Monday.

“The market is rethinking its approach to AI,” M&G chief investment officer for equities Fabiana Fedeli told the FT, arguing that investors are “a lot more selective in which companies [they] will decide to bet on.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US employers announced over 108,000 layoffs across January, in the highest to start the year since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009. Many executives were quick to blame AI for the layoffs, though the real reason might be simpler: companies just aren’t optimistic about the direction the economy is heading.

According to new reporting by CNBC, layoffs are up 118 percent from January, 2025, and a whopping 205 percent compared to December 2025. Throughout the month, US corporations tracked by analyst firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas only reported 5,306 new hires — another low which hadn’t been seen since January of 2009.

“Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer at the analytics firm, told CNBC. “It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.”

The horrid numbers come as tech companies announce plans to dump more money into AI than ever before. Earlier this week, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced it would double its AI capital expenditures from the $90 billion it spent in 2025 to as much as $185 billion, per the New York Times.

With so much hope for AI’s future, it’s no wonder many commentators and businesses titans have blamed the tech for the bone-dry job market. Yet as the market research firm Forrester explained in its January labor report, the “job apocalypse” is way overblown.

“Many companies announcing AI-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted AI applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘AI washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future AI implementation,” the report read.

In fact, some companies’ financial woes might actually be the result of AI-washing in previous years. As Forrester puts it, “over-automating roles due to the hype surrounding AI can lead to costly pullbacks, damaged reputations, and weakened employee experiences.”

So while the job market might be struggling, resist the knee-jerk temptation to blame AI. We’re not living in the cyberpunk dystopia yet — just the age-old grind of an all-too-familiar capitalist economy.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin is being eviscerated this week. The token tanked to a historic low, coming eerily close to as little as $60,000 on Thursday evening. That’s well under 50 percent down from its all-time high a mere four months ago.

While the crypto has since bounced back to around the $68,000 mark, it comes at a grim cost: it’s now wiped out all of its gains since president Donald Trump won the presidential election in late 2025.

Analysts aren’t presumably hopeful about an imminent recovery, with some expecting the absolute worst.

“Our BTC price target is 0.0,” Pivotus Partners chief market strategist and partner Richard Farr tweeted. “That’s not just for shock factor. It’s where the math takes us.”

Farr said he concurred with Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, and recently warned in a Substack post that further losses for Bitcoin could result in a “death spiral.”

Farr pointed to Bitcoin following similar trends to a larger US stock downturn, suggesting it’s no longer the safe haven it was once claimed to be, arguing that it operates as a “speculative instrument correlated to the Nasdaq” instead.

The crypto bear argued that “no serious central bank will ever own something where Michael Saylor controls the float,” referring to the CEO of Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury.

Farr also criticized the token for being damaging to the environment, as mining it requires copious amounts of energy and water.

“Nothing ‘green’ about this ‘coin,&#39;” Farr wrote mockingly. “We think it’s a zero.”

In a follow-up post on LinkedIn, Farr argued that worsening US jobs numbers could cause even more money to “come out of speculative assets, than in,” which led him to feel “increasingly emboldened” about his zero-dollar call.

He also pointed to crypto miners, who were already squeezed by winter storms driving up electricity prices, being forced to close up shop amid the crash.

“We think we are only in the early innings of the crypto correction,” Farr wrote.

In his Substack post, Burry noted that a recent crash in gold prices — following a historic surge — appeared to be linked to Bitcoin’s ongoing demise.

As people continue to gamble on gold futures, Burry argued that “physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand,” triggering a “death spiral”-like collapse.

Considering Bitcoin’s enormous swings over the last couple of months, it’s likely not the end of the ride for the infamously volatile digital token.

Farr clearly isn’t alone in predicting further losses.

“This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,” Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure wrote in a note to clients, as quoted by CNBC.

“Bitcoin isn’t trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,” FG Nexus CEO of digital assets Maja Vujinovic added.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/benchmark-raises-225m-in-special-funds-to-double-down-on-cerebras/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems announced that it raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of $23 billion — a nearly threefold increase from the $8.1 billion valuation the Nvidia rival had reached just six months earlier.

While the round was led by Tiger Global, a huge part of the new capital came from one of the company’s earliest backers: Benchmark Capital. The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. Since Benchmark deliberately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.

What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.

This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.

The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more than $10 billion to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.)

Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips.

The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.

Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, according to Reuters.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The war on California’s proposed ‘Billionaire’s Tax’ is getting weird. This week, amid ongoing rancor from tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called “March for Billionaires” in San Francisco. A website advertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: “Vilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.”

The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user wrote not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitelynot a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.

The San Francisco Examiner first reported that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kaufmann, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kaufmann told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.

In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kaufmann — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”

The policy in question, the Billionaire Tax Act, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according to some experts. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or have already left. It has also led to a monsoon of lobbying in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.

When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kaufmann expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”

“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kaufmann continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”

Online conversation about Kaufmann’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one social media user said, of the event.

Kaufmann told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kaufmann said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.

The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would veto it.

            <div id="article-text">HBO’s hit financial thriller “Industry” has delivered one of its most compelling storylines yet this season: a hunt to expose a fraudulent fintech company called Tender.

The show follows Harper Stern, who’s leading her newly launched investment firm and looking for a company to short — essentially, betting that its stock will crash. After a journalist tips her off that something’s wrong with Tender, she sends her associates, Sweetpea and Kwabena, to Ghana to investigate.

What they discover is damning. “Fake users drive fake revenue drives fake cash,” Sweetpea tells Harper. The entire company appears to be built on fabricated numbers. “The thing is nothing.”

What’s fascinating about this season of “Industry” is how well it speaks to this moment. Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial) Online Safety Bill that the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online. Because of its affiliation with adult content, Tender finds itself at odds with the new government’s regulation and must pivot or die, as the saying goes.

Its CFO-turned-leader, Whitney, wants the company to pivot into a bank and has a plan to make that happen, including making Tender’s CEO, Henry, the face of that transformation. Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs. He’s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.

Harper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years). She has teamed up with new friends and old frenemies and is looking for blood — meaning a company on the precipice of crashing. To her, Tender is that company.

This puts her at odds with her friend Yasmin, who is married to Henry and is crafting communication and lobbying strategies for Tender. It’s pride and prejudice — the sugar and spice that help make the world go round.

The show nails the tech world with such accuracy that reality itself starts to feel like satire. Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender’s media playbook.

There is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family’s bank to Whitney, whose last name is the Jewish-sounding Halberstram. The character is perhaps a nod to the rising “technofacism” criticism of some tech barons.

Harper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. “My real passion lies with finding dead men walking,” she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm.

She is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?

“Who needs realism when she’s such a great character,” one Black British founder told me.

He said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he’s seen that “accurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.”

“Nepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,” one European investor added.

Meanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a ménage à trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney’s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her to Ghislaine Maxwell — perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes.

An Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney.

By now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (like Charlie Javice’s Frank) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (the FTX crypto crash). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimate implosion of the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.

Wirecard admitted that the billions in cash it reported having likely never existed, despite the company’s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones — much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender. Short sellers went after Wirecard, too, and one blog dubbed them “alternative whistleblowers” — people who step in when “the market, and the regulator, refuse to see what is right in front of them.”

The philosophy is one that one could easily see Harper embracing soon enough, especially after Eric tells her at one point that “short-only work is ugly, hard, investigative,” and that it’s “anti-status quo, anti-establishment, anti-power.”

With Wirecard, numerous people, including the CEO, were arrested, while the COO went on the run (and was also accused of being a Russian spy). Tender’s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about “Industry” is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.

It’s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can’t get enough.

            <div id="article-text">Apple CarPlay users may soon be able to talk to their favorite AI chatbot.

Apple is reportedly working on how to support AI chatbot apps within CarPlay, according to Bloomberg, which cites anonymous sources.

Apple CarPlay is an app that runs on an iPhone and wirelessly communicates with a vehicle’s infotainment system. It projects some of the apps found on a user’s phone onto the vehicle’s infotainment display. Drivers are able to interact with these apps, including Apple Music, messaging, and navigation, through its voice assistant Siri.

Apple’s next-generation CarPlay Ultra goes a step further, including the central touchscreen display and digital dashboard located right in front of the driver, and gives users control of certain vehicle settings.

This latest move would theoretically bring Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the car, and at the risk of putting its own Siri assistant in the back seat.

            <h2>From Svedka to Anthropic, brands make bold plays with AI in Super Bowl ads</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/super-bowl-60-ai-ads-svedka-anthropic-brands-commercials/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following last year’s trend of showcasing AI in multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.

Let’s explore the biggest moments from this year’s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.

Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company’s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.

According to Svedka’s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.

​The company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.

​It’s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.

Either way, Svedka definitely got people talking.

Anthropic’s ad wasn’t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI’s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude’s features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example.

It wasn’t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI’s Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn’t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.

Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.

The ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.

The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year’s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.

Amazon’s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical “AI is out to get me” storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.

Beyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.

Ring’s commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet’s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.

Ring recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.

Google’s ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.

Ramp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner — the actor who played Kevin in “The Office” — for its Super Bowl commercial.

In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp’s AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp’s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.

And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin’s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.

Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.

Health company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson’s expensive anti-aging routines.

In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.

Website builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and “vibe coding” with full visual editing and customization.

Wix’s biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace’s ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, WordPress launched a new Claude connector, enabling site owners to share back-end data with Anthropic’s chatbot system. Users can control what specific data they want to share, and access can also be revoked if and when the user chooses.

Notably, Claude is given read-only access, meaning it won’t be able to alter anything within a user’s CMS. However, last year WP claimed that it would eventually deliver “write” access to the MCP integration, presumably allowing users to conduct editorial tasks directly from a connected chatbot of their choosing.

At any rate, after Claude is linked to an account, users can ask the chatbot all sorts of questions about the site data that it’s been given access to — from summarizing the site’s monthly web traffic to conducting analysis of which posts have low user engagement.

WordPress has also provided a list of template prompts for the chatbot — stuff like “Show me pending comments on my blog” or “Which of my sites gets the most traffic?” or “Show me which posts are generating the most discussion.” Others functions include comment management (“Show me pending comments on my blog”) and plug-in management (“What plug-ins are installed on my main site?”).

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/milan-cortina-winter-olympics-opening-ceremony/685918/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every Olympics opening ceremony is an advertisement—for the host country, for the Olympics themselves, for the notion of a free-trading global order competing through sport, in the same place and on even ground. This year, the ceremony for the Winter Olympics, held in the Italian cities Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, was also an advertisement for the past.

This focus on the old is, well, new. Although every ceremony is, to some degree, a celebration of the host country’s history, the event has recently tended to feel like a technology-conference keynote, or a music festival. Two years ago, in Paris, organizers turned the seventh arrondissement into a light show and devoted considerable airtime to the Minions. Beijing’s event, in 2022, looked uncannily like a laptop screensaver. The year prior, at the opening for the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games, the mood was painfully contemporary, with a minimalist soundtrack and drones flying overhead. Everyone wants to reinvent the wheel, and the Olympics are a chance to show off on the world’s biggest stage. Usually, it seems, this is accomplished via lots and lots of LEDs.

This year’s ceremony, by contrast, opened with a pair of dancers in angel wings reenacting the neoclassical sculpture Psyche Revived by Cupid’s Kiss, which was created about 100 years before the invention of the lightbulb. The show then ran through a psychedelic tribute to a bygone Italy, a sort of live highlight reel of hundreds of years of civilization, rendered bonkersly but quaintly: Color-saturated Roman centurions marched solemnly in line with people dressed as moka pots; visual gags celebrated pasta, paparazzi, the film La Dolce Vita. At one point, the great composers Verdi, Puccini, and Rossini appeared in bobblehead proportions, like the guys who run the bases at Minor League baseball games: history turned into a cartoon, very literally.

At nearly every moment, the reference point was somewhere from decades to millennia in the past. The violinist Giovanni Andrea Zanon played a 300-year-old Stradivarius; a phalanx of models strutted around in classic suits in the colors of the Italian flag; the actress Sabrina Impacciatore paid tribute to the Olympics’ more recent past via an extended dance sequence set in the 1970s and ’80s. Even Mariah Carey, the show’s major modern performer, was dressed like an Old Hollywood starlet in a sparkly dress and a voluminous ostrich-feather stole; she sang an exceptionally breathy version of “Nel blu, dipinto di blu,” which came out in 1958.

Maybe all of this is to be expected for a country whose best-known cultural influences lived during the Renaissance. But the production itself was also undeniably retro: The lights were minimal, the music mostly classical, the choreography traditional. With a few exceptions, the entire show could have been produced anytime in the past 40 years.

Before the opening ceremony, people gathered in the streets to protest the governments of various countries competing, as well as the festivities’ very existence amid a major affordability crisis in Milan. During the Games, organizers will be using 3 million cubic yards of artificial snow: In Northern Italy, as in all over the world, the sky can no longer be reliably expected to behave like it used to. The 2028 Summer Games, to be held in Los Angeles, are already beset by concerns about cost overruns. The Olympics are one of our oldest global institutions, which is another way of saying they are a bit archaic—of, and invented in, a different world. The future is uncertain; best to focus on the past.</div>

            <h2>Why Trump Is Picking Fights With Big U.S. Banks</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/trump-jp-morgan-lawsuit-picking-fights-banks/685921/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

For as long as the Trump family has been cashing in on crypto, Don Jr., Eric, and their affiliates have deployed a particular narrative about their reasons for investing in the industry. Back in 2024, before the launch of a crypto empire that has now reportedly added at least $867 million to the family fortune, Don Jr. said on his podcast that digital assets were “obviously very appealing to guys like me who have been debanked”—an umbrella term for being cut off from a financial institution—“because they don’t check certain boxes.”

That same narrative is behind the president’s current legal assault on major banks. When Donald Trump returned to office last year, he started going after some of the businesses and individuals who he believed had wronged him in the past. On the list were universities, white-shoe law firms, and some of America’s largest banks. In a recent $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, which follows a similar suit from last year against Capital One, Trump alleged that he had been debanked on unfair grounds. In court filings, he accused each firm of closing his accounts in 2021 due to “political and social motivations” and “unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs” that they needed to distance themselves “from President Trump and his conservative political views.” (The JPMorgan suit, which the company said has “no merit,” arrived a day after Dimon publicly criticized the president’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates; Capital One has also denied Trump’s allegations and filed a motion to dismiss the case.)

The Trumps were indeed cut off from some financial services in 2021. But although they claim that it had to do with political bias and checking “certain boxes,” there is likely a simpler explanation: the fact that, on January 6, the president fomented a riot at the Capitol and tried to overturn the results of a national election. In the weeks and months after the insurrection, Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank reportedly refused further dealings with Trump, and Capital One and JPMorgan closed many of his personal and business accounts. Part of the reason debanking has become such a flashpoint is that financial institutions aren’t required to explain to their customers why they’ve been cut off. Despite much speculation at the time, only Signature publicly provided reasoning for its decision, citing the Capitol attack.

Debanking is a nebulous concept. It can include loan denials as well as account closures for financial or nonfinancial reasons, and it can encompass broad actions across multiple banks as well as a single action at one bank. It’s not clear whether JPMorgan and Capital One actually discriminated against Trump on the basis of his political views. And even if they are found to have done so, the law is not clear on whether that’s illegal.

The legal experts I spoke with said that Trump’s argument is shaky. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prevents discrimination against customers on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, and age—but, crucially, not political alignment. Beyond that, banks are mostly free to choose whom they do business with. And financial dealings with Trump were considered risky well before January 6, thanks to his history of business failures. In 2016, The New York Times reported that some bankers had captured the sentiment in a neat, two-word phrase: Donald risk.

That risk was only exacerbated by the events of January 6 and by Trump’s impeachment soon after, when it became apparent that there would be some kind of reckoning for what had happened at the Capitol. Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told me that the riot was “very reasonable” grounds “for any institution to drop a client.” The banks “were wary of the public seeing them doing business with Trump-related organizations,” Graham Steele, a Stanford Law fellow who worked in the Treasury Department under Joe Biden, explained to me; they were also likely “worried that somehow the funds in their accounts would be found to have helped finance, frankly, an insurrection.”

Even outside of these lawsuits, Trump has argued that conservatives are often targets for debanking. Last summer, he signed an executive order intended to protect customers who are debanked because of their political or religious beliefs. Although this may sound good on paper, he’s focused on the wrong issue. A 2025 review from Reuters found that out of the thousands of complaints about closed bank accounts filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, fewer than 1 percent of them “include the terms ‘politics,’ ‘religion,’ ‘conservative’ or ‘Christian.’”

But exclusion from the American banking system remains a real problem, particularly for low-income people and people of color. There are few broad studies on the debanking phenomenon as Trump seems to understand it—but there’s plenty of data on the communities that have historically been excluded from the financial system. A 2023 report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that Black, Hispanic, and American Indian households were unbanked (meaning they have no checking or savings account) at much higher rates than white households, and that the share of households with no form of mainstream credit at all (credit cards, mortgages, car loans) was higher among lower-income and less-educated households.

“There are certain communities that have a legacy of having been redlined out of getting access to credit and financial services,” Steele said. “That’s the real debanking problem.” Trump’s lawsuits and executive order probably won’t do much to chip away at that systemic issue. The president may say that he is protecting those who face discrimination, but his goals here are, as usual, extremely personal.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

With this week’s announcement of massive cuts at The Washington Post, the paper’s Book World supplement earned a dismal distinction: It may be the only newspaper book-review section to have been killed twice. The first time was in 2009, when papers across the country were slashing books coverage in an attempt to stave off budgetary apocalypse. So when the Post relaunched Book World in 2022, readers and writers reacted with the same mixture of amazement and trepidation inspired by the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. The rebirth of a dead species was wonderful to see, but how would it end?

Explore. You’ve never seen Super Bowl betting like this before, Jacob Stern writes.

Read. In his new novel, Daniyal Mueenuddin attempts to bring together the stories of people whose lives rarely intersect in meaningful ways, Karan Mahajan writes.

The Olympic flame, carried through all 110 provinces in Italy over the past 63 days, has reached its final destinations: a pair of identical cauldrons in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. The dynamic structures, made of 1,440 aluminum components that expand and contract, hold the flame enclosed in a small container in their center, where it will stay lit until the end of the Games, on February 22.</div>

            <h2>The Real Winner of TrumpRx</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/trumprx-prescription-drug-prices/685919/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nothing about TrumpRx is subtle. When you open up the government’s new online drugstore, the first thing you see is a banner with giant text: “Find the world’s lowest prices on prescription drugs.” Launched last night, TrumpRx allows Americans to purchase certain medications at steep discounts—either by buying them directly from the drug company or by showing a coupon at the pharmacy. “Thanks to President Trump, the days of Big Pharma price-gouging are over,” the website says.

TrumpRx does make a compelling case that the president has mounted an extraordinary effort to stop pharmaceutical companies from ripping off Americans. The website offers discounts on some 40 drugs—the result of months of negotiations between drugmakers and the Trump administration. In a press conference announcing TrumpRx yesterday, Trump boasted that “16 of the 17 largest pharmaceutical companies have signed agreements” to list their drugs on the website. “And the other one is coming,” he added. The Trump administration was able to negotiate a nearly 85 percent discount on a trio of drugs typically used as part of IVF. Americans can also buy Wegovy, the wildly popular weight-loss injection, for as little as $199 a month, a fraction of the original list price.

But these are the exceptions. Most Americans looking for their prescription drugs won’t find that many deals on the site. Health care is complicated already, and TrumpRx apparently does not always offer the cheapest or best option. Those with insurance—some 85 percent of Americans—typically will get a better deal using the coverage they already have than they would paying out of pocket on TrumpRx. More than three-quarters of Americans with commercial insurance are eligible to pay $20 or less for a month’s supply of Xeljanz, a rheumatoid-arthritis drug. But customers paying cash via TrumpRx will still shell out more than $1,500.

Even people without insurance may be able to find better prices in some cases. Consider Protonix, a drug from Pfizer used to treat acid reflux. TrumpRx offers the drug for just over $200—a 55 percent discount from its typical $447. But what the website does not explain is that there’s a much cheaper, generic version of Protonix on the market (but not available through TrumpRx). According to GoodRx, a drug-discount website similar to TrumpRx, the generic version can be purchased for less than $10. The same is true for Pristiq, an antidepressant. Consumers can buy the drug for $200 on TrumpRx or get the generic via GoodRx for a tenth of the price. Patients going through financial hardships can also sometimes qualify for charity programs, which subsidize their prescriptions.

The big winners of yesterday’s announcement seem to be not patients, but drug companies. The Trump administration got drugmakers to the negotiating table last year by writing letters to the companies threatening to “deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices.” Drugmakers were able to turn the threat into a PR opportunity: When Pfizer cut a deal to participate in the program, the company’s CEO, Albert Bourla, was brought to the West Wing, where Trump called the drug company “one of the greatest in the world.”

Drug companies have also successfully protected their ability to charge whatever they please for some of their biggest moneymakers. Yesterday, Trump claimed that the website includes discounts for “dozens of the most commonly used prescription drugs,” but many of the pharmaceutical industry’s best-selling products—some of which also are among their more expensive offerings—are absent from the website. Take Keytruda, Merck’s cancer drug that was the world’s best seller until it was recently surpassed by the weight-loss and diabetes injection tirzepatide: That drug retails for roughly $12,000 for a three-week course of treatment, and it is missing from TrumpRx. Of the top 10 best-selling prescription drugs in 2024, only one—Ozempic—is listed on TrumpRx.

TrumpRx may become better with age. A White House press release from December named multiple additional drugs that are supposed to be included in TrumpRx but are not. The drugmaker Gilead Sciences, the White House touted in the press release, will sell one of its hepatitis-C medications for about $2,400 rather than its original asking price of nearly $25,000. Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email that only five companies’ drugs have been added to the TrumpRx website so far. In its negotiations, the administration has also secured commitments from drugmakers that when they launch new drugs, they will not charge Americans more than they charge individuals in similar nations, which has the potential to dramatically lower the prices Americans pay for new medicines. (It’s still unclear, however, if all of those new drugs will also be available on TrumpRx.)

For Americans who find discounts on TrumpRx, the platform is likely to make a meaningful difference in their lives. It’s addressing, in its so-far-limited ways, a persistent problem in American life. That said, Trump has claimed before to have provided Americans with real relief at the pharmacy counter. During his first term, the president said that seniors would soon receive $200 discount cards in the mail that they could bring to the pharmacy to help defray the high costs of their drugs. The cards never showed up. This time, the downloadable coupons, at least, are real. They are branded with a golden eagle holding a TrumpRx ribbon in its talons.</div>

            <h2>The Obama Meme on Trump’s Truth Social Was Exactly What It Looked Like</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/trump-truth-social-obama-ape/685913/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump supercharged his political career by claiming that Barack Obama wasn’t American. Yesterday, 16 minutes before midnight, the president’s account on Truth Social posted a video that suggests Obama isn’t even human. It briefly shows the head of the first Black president and that of his wife superimposed onto the bodies of apes. They dance along to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The video, which Trump’s account shared twice, seems to be a screen recording. Its first minute shows a clip promoting the lie that voting-machine tampering handed Joe Biden the presidency in 2020. Then, someone seems to swipe up, and the clip depicting the Obamas as apes flashes into focus.

The clip is on the screen for only a moment before the recording returns to the voting-machine video. And just before noon today, both posts of the video were removed from the president’s Truth Social account. (When I asked why, a White House official who declined to provide their name claimed that an unnamed employee “erroneously made the post.”)

In the interim, hundreds if not thousands of people responded to the clip with enthusiasm.  Immediately after the video was first posted on Truth Social, the memecoin $APEBAMA was minted. Within 12 hours, more than $4 million worth of $APEBAMA had been traded back and forth. In an X group with the same name that now has hundreds of members, the pinned tweet implies that the meme stock will succeed because of how outrageous the video is: “this is pretty much on par with him calling Obama a nigga.” Some members posted their own depictions of Obama as a monkey or ape. The ape video’s apparent creator, the X user @xerias_x, reposted the full video to their X account early this morning. Besides the Obamas, the video shows a menagerie of Democratic politicians as animals, bowing down to Trump, who appears as a lion. It now has more than 1 million views. (@xerias_x also seems to be the originator of an AI-generated video Trump reposted in October that shows the president raining down what appears to be excrement on protesters from the sky.)

The “joke” that Trump’s account spread is plainly sinister. The idea that Black people sit somewhere between white people and apes has long been used to justify cruelty. In 1377, a historian wrote that Africans “have attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals,” meaning they “are, as a whole, submissive to slavery.” Cartoons circulated during the Civil War were printed with images similar to the one Trump posted: One labels a monkey holding a book upside down as a NEGRO-MAN; another depicts a Black man on all fours, accompanied by the words WHAR’S JEFF DAVIS. In 1906, a man born in what was then the Belgian Congo, Ota Benga, was displayed at the Bronx Zoo in a cage with an orangutan. In 1975, white teenagers harassed Black students desegregating a Boston public school with the chant “Two, four, six, eight, assassinate the nigger apes.”

The ape caricature still colors how Black people are received in America. But this morning, the administration played the video off for laughs. “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in response to a comment request before the Truth Social posts were removed. (The Lion King features a monkey named Rafiki, but no apes appear in the film.)

The White House did not answer my questions about why the administration initially defended the video, or why it remained up on the president’s account for 12 hours. Even if a staffer did post the Obama video, its message is resonant with the president’s past statements and actions. Trump has called Somalis “low-IQ,” and his administration recently announced rules that will ban nearly 90 percent of African immigrant visa applicants.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Updated with new questions at 3:40 p.m. ET on February 6, 2026.

Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

Find previous questions here, and to get Atlantic Trivia in your inbox every day, sign up for The Atlantic Daily.

And by the way, did you know that there is only one Super Bowl not known by Roman numerals? Even the first four championship games—not numbered at the time—were retroactively labeled I, II, III, and IV.

Yet in 2016, we got Super Bowl 50. If you know your Roman numerals, you will see why: No team should be forced to play for the big W in a game known as the big L.

How did you do? Come back next week for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the video clips in the opening credits of The Office were filmed by John Krasinski—Jim Halpert on the series—who made a preshow pilgrimage to its setting of Scranton, Pennsylvania? He captured the footage with a camera stuck out of a sunroof as he drove around the city.

A tour de Scranton would look different today. There’s now the Office museum exhibit, the Office-branded industrial tower, the Office mural, the other Office mural …

And by the way, did you know that President George Washington gave the country’s shortest-ever inaugural address? His speech upon reelection was only 135 words, which takes about 45 seconds to deliver, at least by my rate of speech.

In contrast, President William Henry Harrison’s was 8,445 words. I did not try that one, because I have places to be (and, to be fair, when he tried it, he got pneumonia and died a month later).

And by the way, did you know that the world’s oldest continuous art tradition is the rock painting of Australia’s Aboriginal people? The earliest artworks discovered on the island are estimated to be 30,000 years or older, and many Aboriginal artists still paint on rock walls.

In fact, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Aboriginal art began to be captured on anything more portable than stone or more durable than sand. The art on canvas is beautiful—but it will take quite the preservationist to keep it looking good in 42,206 C.E.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.</div>

it is obvious if you understand the concept of driving instead of mimicking it statistically with some probability.

a simple difference that the &quot;AI&quot; proponents and &quot;investors&quot; can&#39;t seem to grasp and acknowledge.

I&#39;m sure someone though of it. What&#39;s obvious from the failures is that model training isn&#39;t a substitute for understanding, which the model is lacking. So it will always have a nonzero chance to fuck up an obvious situation, which is what we mostly deal with.

Of course you&#39;ll have people arguing it isn&#39;t different with people on the account of the outcome (people are slower, get tired, etc) but the fundamental difference is the understanding, and the model doesn&#39;t have it.

What&#39;s obvious from the failures is that model training isn&#39;t a substitute for understanding, which the model is lacking. Even if the model doesn&#39;t have understanding, it can be trained to stop for school buses.

No, you cannot expect determinism from a fully probabilistic model. Someone must hardcode the laws of robotics in those positronic brainz, and we know that even that won&#39;t work.

the model inputs (road conditions, perceived bus color, etc) are always random.

Yes, they could, but at some point it will get way more expensive than a driver just because of all that hardware, while the original idea was, I presume, to replace the drivers for less. No idea how much is invested up to today and how the costs compare to the results achieved. I would guess they are still way more expensive than a driver.

I do disagree that there&#39;s a larger non zero chance to duck up an obvious situation for a machine than for a human driver. Perhaps the chance is larger for non obvious cases, but that will get fixed.

Also, you seem to assume that self driving is largely straight out of a model, like LLMs hallucin

Actually, it is not exactly the same in all 50 states for multi-lane roads.  In the linked article it states that the Waymo vehicle was filmed breezing through the opposite lane of traffic.  The laws vary on opposing traffic depending on the state.

For a multi-lane road with only a turn lane separating the opposing traffic, Texas law requires opposing traffic to stop.  Texas school bus laws  [liggettlawgroup.com]

But for Washington state, Missouri, South Carolina, and a few others, a turn lane is enough separation to allow opposing

I would expect if a single driver racked up 25 safety violations involving school buses that their drivers license should be suspended.

Austin ISD has asked Waymo to stop operating near schools during bus hours until the issue is resolved. Waymo refused.I would like to see the context behind why Waymo refused this request, prima facie it seems like a reasonable request.

I&#39;d say it&#39;s time to get the lawyers involved.

They obviously need more statistics to retrain the failing models. Knocking down a few kids in the process isn&#39;t a large cost, the investors will cover the damages.

By killing the slow unobservant kids Waymo is improving the human race, ready for the war against AI.

yeah, we&#39;ll have to evolve to deal with the &quot;AI&quot; bullshit. I guess we&#39;re too dumb to do it from first principles.

...failing to stop for buses during loading and unloading -- illegal in all 50 statesWell, maybe illegal or not, depending on the circumstances and depending on the state:
Not necessary to stop if the bus is in a loading zone that is completely off the road if crossing the road is not permitted.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction if the road has 4 or more lanes.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction if the road has a barrier between travel directions.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction if the road has a median.Not necessary to stop in the opposite direction

...failing to stop for buses during loading and unloading -- illegal in all 50 states

Well, maybe illegal or not, depending on the circumstances and depending on the state:

I&#39;ve always found these rules poorly calibrated and overly conservative.basically based on moral panic about kids rather than logic about traffic laws and sharing the road fairly.

but there are no school buses where I currently live, so haven&#39;t been annoyed by it for a while.(tbh idk WHY there aren&#39;t buses or how kids get to school here.  )

Our traffic laws really do need to be standardized at the national levelThat will be great, then we can have supreme court judge manipulation and national elections based on whether right turn on red should be legal or not. Give me passing on the right or give me death! Make America great again, get rid of the roundabouts! Speed up to get through yellow lights is change we can believe in!

Also an incident where a Waymo got confused on the interstate, which it is forbidden to even be on.

These people are so dumb. Hollywood didn&#39;t go all in on computer graphics when they were shitty back in 1980, they waited until they got gud and made avatar in 2009. Maybe someday &quot;AI&quot; will get there but all these people betting the house on &quot;AI&quot; being perfect right out of the box are just stupid people. I wish there were consequences for their failures but that&#39;s not the way capitalism in this country seems to work anymore.

And yes, &quot;AI&quot; has been a thing since before computer graphics, but I&#39;m talking about

The slop problem is not the quality of the graphics. The slop problem is the lack of understanding of the task, which leads to the inevitable weirdness.

Suppose you make a movie and put all your savings into the production. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s $1m just as an arbitrary amount. Suppose the  bet fails and you&#39;ve lost your savings. Real consequence, and it hurts you. Now suppose the movie producer is Elon. Same outcome, same consequences. But he doesn&#39;t hurt, and will do another one right away.

Also, you can replace &quot;financing a movie&quot; with &quot;buying an election&quot; and reach the same conclusion.

If AI themed movie is to do well, it has to have a well thought out storyline, preferred meaning to life.

Oh I forgot to mention.WarGames was shown in 1983.

Average people understand that and for LLM-type AI, experts understand that. Just the layer in between is still clueless and thinks it is the second coming.

In the not too distant past all the articles I saw were positive for AI.  So far this year the trend all seems to be not positive for AI and this article is just adding to it.  I&#39;m rather hoping that the more this sentiment builds, the less appetite there will be to cram AI into everything and we can start getting back to a world that isn&#39;t increasingly filled with AI slop.

C&#39;mon, &quot;Melania&quot; is offering some VERY stiff competition in that race.

Three movies mention AI as part of the plot and this means Hollywood has an AI boner right now? Have you watched Hollywood in the last... well, since it started? I mean, some of Slashdot&#39;s favorite movies are all about AI and none of them were made this year - The Terminator series, The Matrix, even Age of Ultron.

The reason these movies tanked are various but:

- Tron has never done well. We all want it to, but it&#39;s not going to happen. Additionally Aries had That Guy in it, and Aries also broke the formula by having it be set primarily in the real world. It just wasn&#39;t a good entry in a series that isn&#39;t very popular to begin with.- Mission Impossible is getting long in the tooth. It&#39;s arguably the only one of the three that could have done well, but the marketing did nothing to raise excitement for the movie. Also, no idea what the reviews were like, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, it seemed more contrived than usual.- The Megan &quot;series&quot; flopped because it was supposed to be an entertaining one off, and virtually everyone looking at it said &quot;Why the hell does it have a sequel&quot;.

I don&#39;t see any evidence Hollywood is doing an AI bet, they just released three movies that happened to be about AI in some form and happened to flop.

Just like it&#39;s fashionable to justify anything because it &quot;helps&quot; small businesses.

surely there are ways to help &quot;small business&quot; however the GOP defines such without also giving a luscious handj...er, handshake to companies that have never paid their fair share

So you do admit they won&#39;t pass on any savings to you. They will split it between growing their business or giving it to investors, the only thing that makes sense. So it&#39;s one way, right? Taxes go up and they cut you deeper, taxes go down and they squeeze more juice. There&#39;s no upside. There&#39;s nothing for you to celebrate.

And you have to tax them or you can&#39;t use tax incentives to steer them the way you want like buying American, creating jobs not robots, whatever. Same thing you do with individual income

LOL. So you think Amazon lowered the prices with those billions in extra revenue. ROFLMAO.You need to be a shareholder.  Consumers pay all the taxes.  Shareholders benefit from all the tax breaks.

LOL. So you think Amazon lowered the prices with those billions in extra revenue. ROFLMAO.

You need to be a shareholder.  Consumers pay all the taxes.  Shareholders benefit from all the tax breaks.

Consumers pass on their tax burden by spending less, you should fucking know.

It&#39;s a cycle, that&#39;s how the economy works, dipshit. All incomes should be tapped. Then tax incentives can be used to encourage behavior that benefits economic growth and social stability.

OFC some rich fucks want the tax burden moved entirely to personal income taxes, they get better effective tax rates there, it&#39;s pretty obvious what the play is.

Is this some dry satire or something? Isn&#39;t Amazon responsible for destroying small and local businesses with it&#39;s aggressive pricing policies and sellers fees? Didn&#39;t we witness the destruction of brick and mortar stores at the hands of Amazon just two decades prior?

No, that was Walmart, Target and Kroger in the 70s and 80s, Amazon didn&#39;t even start selling books online until 1996.

Small businesses get the exact same depreciation and R&D expense tax breaks as Amazon, but the numbers involved are proportionally smaller...

That&#39;s awesome, and it helps Amazon more. One of the last companies on the planet that needed a leg up. May their investments trickle upon you.

I am all for Amazon keeping the money they earned rather than turning it over to the government.The government shutdown for like thirty something days last year and I would not have known if I did not turn on the news.Amazon would not deliver anything for three days because of snow last week, and I sure as hell noticed that every day!

I do not mind Amazon keeping $7.8 billion that would just go to either fraud in Minnesota, or DHS annoying and shooting Minnesotans in the street.I am happy for a strong milita

Wasn&#39;t the debt a big concern a year ago or have tariffs reduced it as promised?

&quot;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not upset that you lied to me, I&#39;m upset that from now on I can&#39;t believe you.&quot;

&quot;If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.&quot;

&quot;Everything the State says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen.&quot;

Yu need to butter up the rapist before you get these cuts.

Do what that guy in the UAE did (Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, national security advisor and UAE President&#39;s brother), buy a $500 million stake in Trump&#39;s crypto company (World Liberty Financial). With that kind of payola you could easily call the President whenever you wanted!

My tax bill didn&#39;t drop 87%From the summary: &quot;That&#39;s largely because of the generous new depreciation breaks&quot; 

Did you buy stuff for your home business? It looks like the tax break is the one where instead of depreciating something a business (home or international conglomerate) buys over a number of years, they get to depreciate it all in the first year. 

For example is my home business I got to take such a deduction for a computer, a display, and a really good chair. I bought more than that but those are the things over the dolla

How many data centers did you build? How many warehouses?

Tax breaks for capital equipment depreciation are not new, R&D expenditures are often deductible too. I had to visit the senior bean counter more than once to find out if something was capital (therefore depreciated) or expense.

The new $1.6 billion dollar plant that was built in 2009 got tax breaks. The $12 million dollar pilot plant that was built for the next generation reactors (chemical not nuclear) was also depreciated as per schedule and cou

I for one don&#39;t have a problem with this. I give uncle Jeff a lot of money each year and I prefer he doesn&#39;t spend it frivolously in another country. Americans are pretty rich as it is, they don&#39;t need more money.

Now, ideally, uncle Jeff should pay his share of taxes in my country, but he&#39;s a greedy foreigner who manipulates public opinion and undercuts local businesses, so it&#39;s a work in progress.

Multi-national corporations by their very nature spend the money you give them (revenue) on other countries.

Globalization happened. Deal with it. No way to turn back the clock, we certainly can&#39;t go back to Second Industrial Revolution and even going back to the Third Industrial Revolution is going to destroy the US&#39;s position in world finance and make us all poorer. But the Jeff Bezos of the world will still be rich in that scenario.

Whether we all become poorer is irrelevant, what is bad is if some are much richer than others. Wealth is relative, not absolute. In some places, excessively rich people are rightly targeted. In some places, they remain

Amazon gets its tax bill reduced by almost 90% while at the same time it produces a schlock film about an illegal immigrant who used chain migration to get their parents into the country.

Thanks for the tip! I reported them to ICE.

Thanks for the tip! I reported them to ICE.Amazon or Melania?

Thanks for the tip! I reported them to ICE.

I&#39;d boycott but I need same day delivery too much.

Everything costs more due to tariffs. Please stop the winning!

The tariff pung ping games have driven investment out of the US.  VW for example has reduced investment here and diverted it to China, because at least in China they know what the investment environment will be like a week from now.

...money can buy! ...a shitty vanity film for his wife can buy!

It&#39;s good to be a well-funded sycophant of the king.

Four out of five of the top AI companies have weathered multiple economic downturns and have other business ventures funding the LLM wing.

  Agree.  That could be solved by the AI-bros actually charging for the services, which will have to happen someday.  They will have to start making actual profit on this shit, someday.  Although, I&#39;d also think that a lot of the useless shit people ask AI to do could be handled by local models, which would be cheaper to run. I would think summarizing an email should certainly not require 10 top of the line GPUs to do by now.

It doesn&#39;t, and they wouldn&#39;t. Your request doesn&#39;t get 10 top of the line GPUs, it probably gets one for a second or so, or maybe a few for a fraction of that. Then the next of your billion friends gets to use it. By the time they&#39;ve had their turn you&#39;ve had a chan

Up until September the G.Skill memory kit I&#39;d been buying to build computers was $119.99 and now its over $400 that&#39;s close to a 400% increase

Yes, it&#39;s nearly 4x since September.  The article is blinkered.

Perhaps, if you had more memory, your calculator could figure it out.

Maybe if you had some common courtesy......

Courtesy for somebody that proudly posts grossly wrong numbers? Naa. Not justified. Do better.

Nope. No amount of common courtesy makes your math work. Sorry, Charlie.

Nope. No amount of common courtesy makes your math work. Sorry, Charlie.Have you tried interpreting the digits as octal and assuming a logarithmic scale? :-)

That was really a quite gentle correction for these environs.

Taking the time to make it humorous makes it A+

The DDR5 kit I got in August has gone from $121 to $590.

It&#39;s a very low-latency kit, I know they haven&#39;t all spiked as much but certain desirable specs are going crazy.

It&#39;s no competition really. Billionaires get to decide the priority, and it will be for their money making data centers and not the nearby communities.

The bloatware show is over. We coders aren&#39;t going to be allowed to import a massive library to solve some tiny problem in our projects. We might have to actually design and code up light weight solutions again if we want our programmers to actually fit on people&#39;s computers.

Did salesforce swoop in and save them or something?

No, Saleforce degraded their service as soon as they took over. It&#39;s been a slow death ever since.

If Salesforce is not extracting a pound of flesh every year from each customer they have, they&#39;re not happy.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

Thursday night, Donald Trump posted something racist enough to break through on social media—a rarity, as his offensive social media posts often go ignored these days. But the visceral, undeniable racism of this particular iteration, and the White House’s initial refusal to express any remorse, pushed it through. And at least one Republican senator expressed disapproval: Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”

The source of all this commotion was a screengrab of a video Trump posted on Truth Social depicting the heads of former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama laughing, open-mouthed, on ape bodies.

The screengrab is real, and the underlying video it comes from is stranger than one might expect. Trump posted the video on Truth Social at 8:44 p.m. on Thursday, and it’s actually largely about election fraud, taking you through baseless and frankly dull conspiracy theory material. But at the end, for about two seconds, it flashes to a bright jungle scene, featuring the laughing Obamas, to the tune of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The last two seconds appeared to be clipped into the video for shock humor, meant to throw a laugh in for the racists who had made it all the way through. There is no mitigating “context” here. With or without the election-fraud part, it was the Black president and first lady, depicted as apes, in one of the oldest and most dehumanizing racist tropes in history.

At first, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to defend the post as being “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King.” She added: “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

And, sure, the original video that those bizarre last seconds were taken from does indeed show Trump as a lion and Democrats as figures that could conceivably be thought of as Lion King characters—Hillary Clinton as Pumbaa, Hakeem Jeffries as Timon—bowing to him. But there are no ape characters in the Lion King. The video is generated by A.I., and is not in the animated style of the 1993 animated film but is instead standard A.I. slop. Perhaps the A.I. added in the additional characters to muddle the racism of depicting the Obamas as apes, but the fact remains that it opens with the scene of the Obamas, and lingers on it longer than the others.

And the creator of the video is not known for his delicacy or tact. Per the watermark and his own claims on X, the creator, who has Pepe the Frog for an avatar, is the same internet user behind the infamous October slop video of Trump dumping sewage onto protesters from a fighter jet. That video shocked people for its raw animosity toward legal protesters practicing their First Amendment rights, as well as for the profoundly juvenile behavior from a sitting president. If you scroll through the creator’s more recent material, it appears he pretty much exclusively makes similarly mindless, low-quality slop content with obvious MAGA messages. Other videos have included Tom Homan as a Jedi fighting protesters in Minneapolis; Don Lemon being arrested and twerking in prison; and Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, being hit with a car and thrown, cartoonishly, into the air.

Even if the original video had no racist intent, which it does, defending the original video makes no sense: Trump didn’t post the original video. He posted a two-second clip of the Obamas as apes. The message is clear.

The one valid defense would be one of ignorance. We can’t know exactly how Trump encountered this video. It’s unclear if Trump watched the entire clip, meaning maybe he didn’t see those two seconds at the end. The White House claimed it was a staffer who actually posted it. But given the highly nonstrategic style of the account’s posting that evening—another post was of an inoffensive TikTok featuring a dog eager to be fed whipped cream, classic Trump stuff—it seems a strange kind of post for a staffer.

Much more crucially, the White House left the video up once they learned of the racist section. Trump did not apologize. The White House did eventually take it down, but only after it had been up for 12 hours.

Trump has done and said many other aggressively anti-Black things in his years in the public eye; this video is not the worst. But it still says something profound about the president and his administration that they were made aware of thoroughly ugly racism coming from the president’s own messages and chose not to apologize to Black Americans or correct the error, but instead to turn against the public.

Amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s assault on Minnesota’s immigrant communities, another abuse has drawn less attention: a brazen disregard for judicial limits on his deportation campaign. The courts have determined that in January alone the administration violated at least 96 orders in 74 cases challenging the unlawful detention of immigrants in Minneapolis. The Justice Department has failed to meet its most basic obligations in many of these cases, due to an apparent combination of malice, incompetence, and institutional depletion. Further evidence of its unraveling came on Tuesday, when Julie Le, a government attorney, told Judge Jerry Blackwell, in open court: “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.” Of the backlog in Minneapolis, Le then told Blackwell: “What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Le’s shocking courtroom breakdown and what it reveals about the DOJ’s broader meltdown under Trump’s impossible demands. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Is this the clearest sign yet that for all of its tough talk about going to “war” with “rogue judges,” the DOJ under Trump is in full-on dumpster-fire crisis mode?

Mark Joseph Stern: It’s a sign that the Justice Department is actively collapsing. And it’s important to understand the background here. Blackwell had ordered Le to explain why the government failed to comply with his order demanding the release of a detained immigrant, as well as why she shouldn’t be personally held in contempt for defying that order. Her response was that she had been given an impossible task. It turned out that the Trump administration had assigned her to the U.S. attorney’s office to handle 88 immigration cases in under a month, a crushing load. That overwhelming surge of immigration cases is happening all over the country, but it’s especially acute in Minneapolis because of the ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities there.

But this is a problem entirely of the administration’s own making. Back in July, the government unilaterally reinterpreted federal immigration law to require the detention of any immigrant who was never legally admitted into the country, rather than allowing them to be released and given a bond hearing. So even if they have lawful presence today, they must be detained indefinitely. As our friend Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, courts have overwhelmingly rejected that reinterpretation: More than 350 decisions by 160 different judges in about 50 different courts have all found that that interpretation is obviously wrong. But because the Supreme Court took away universal injunctions in the birthright citizenship case in its most recent term, no single court can block the government from enforcing this position nationwide, so it keeps trying, over and over again.

That means the government is illegally detaining thousands of immigrants based on an egregious misreading of the law. Those immigrants are flooding the courts with habeas petitions for release. There were 581 habeas cases in Minnesota in January alone—an exponential increase of unmanageable proportions. The courts are overwhelmingly granting these petitions, but then the immigrants are not being released, because the DOJ doesn’t have enough lawyers on hand to process all of the rulings and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually releasing people. So that is the background that led this attorney, Le, to have a breakdown in court and say: I am unable to do the job that has been asked of me.

I want to flag that this isn’t a factual dispute. It’s not a legal dispute. It’s not a pound-on-the-table dispute. It’s a decision by the Justice Department to not have enough lawyers, and to make the system collapse under the weight of indifference and apathy. Since Trump’s second inauguration, you and I have talked a lot about judges who are mad, frustrated, and venting at Trump lawyers. This is something different. It’s scaled up massively. This is an admonition from a judge saying that the entire system of justice cannot be sustained this way, and he is watching it veer off the rails.

You see that in something else Blackwell said on Tuesday: “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.” He’s saying the government cannot create a crisis by detaining way too many immigrants illegally, then claim that it is too overwhelmed to comply with orders releasing those immigrants. That is such a vital point for a judge to make when we know that the Trump administration’s strategy is always Flood the zone. Shock and awe. Inundate the opposition with an endless blitz. And in a very real sense here, the opposition is the judiciary. It’s judges like Blackwell who are willing to stand up and say: This is illegal. You are not allowed to do this.

This is the same DOJ that’s out there on X, advertising for lawyers. Chad Mizelle, former DOJ chief of staff, literally tweeted last month: “If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me.” This isn’t freaking Dairy Queen! But one way to destroy an institution from within is to create a crisis, right? They created a crisis with the immigration sweeps. Then they created a double crisis by saying, “Well, Justice Department lawyers just can’t handle all the work.” It’s a way of signaling that the whole institution is broken.

And that’s the point. If it’s understood that DOJ lawyers suck and there’s nothing a judge can do to enforce his will, the takeaway for the public is: I guess the justice system doesn’t matter. I guess the Constitution doesn’t matter. So Julie Le freaking out in open court doesn’t get us where we need to go. We need to take the next step, which is to say that they are breaking systems and exulting in it. And that’s the part that we are not reckoning with.

I agree. These assistant U.S. attorney positions used to be super prestigious and competitive. They were a launchpad to an elite career in the law. Now Trump officials are basically pleading with people to apply for them by DM on Elon Musk’s Nazi-hangout site. There has been a mass exodus from the Justice Department—thousands of attorneys have fled since Trump returned to office. And of course the White House has purged almost every lawyer who worked on Jan. 6 cases on top of that. And now the administration can’t fill these positions. But this was the inevitable consequence of Trump’s abolishing the traditional independence of the DOJ. The department now works directly for him, including the prosecution of his political adversaries.

On top of that, the attorneys who remain in their positions have to defend these unlawful detentions, racist arrests, and other unconstitutional behavior. They’re being pulled off actual criminal cases to prosecute immigrants instead. Real violent crimes are going unprosecuted so that the deportation machine can be fed. It would take an army of immigration lawyers to handle all of this work that the DOJ has now created for itself. And nobody with a conscience wants to do this stuff. I want to quote another thing Le said in the courtroom, after Blackwell asked her about the government snatching people up in Minnesota, flying them to a detention center across the country, then not bringing them back for hearings. Le said: “I share the same concern with you, Your Honor. I am not white, as you can see, and my family’s at risk as any other people that might get picked up too. So I share the same concern, and I took that concern to heart.”

Here is a lawyer saying: Wait, what am I doing here? Why am I defending these racist policies? I shouldn’t be here either. My own family is at risk because of the policies that I’m defending. When that kind of breakdown of the system is happening in open court, of course there aren’t enough lawyers to do all of this work, because only the most racist, nativist freaks will remain. And there aren’t enough good lawyers who are also racist freaks to carry all of the weight that the DOJ is putting on itself.

To that end, we should note that Le has reportedly been removed from her post. But I think that the point we’re both trying to make is that we learned this lesson from Elon Musk, right? The easiest way to decimate government functioning is to decimate government itself. And so this is an act of contempt, but it’s also an act of power. It’s saying: You can’t make me, and I don’t care.

Imagine you attend a protest, like hundreds of thousands of Americans have since President Donald Trump began his second term. Perhaps it is a No Kings event, or a local ICE demonstration to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants in your community. During the protest, you take a video of yourself and your fellow protesters, caption it “Abolish ICE,” and upload it to Instagram. A few weeks later, there’s a knock on your door. Federal agents stand before you, demanding to question you.

You’re wondering to yourself: Do they know about the protest I attended? Are they legally allowed to track me? Do I have to comply?

The answer to these first two questions is, shockingly, yes, and it’s made possible in part by a little-known power that the Trump administration has supercharged in recent months. The answer to the last question is much more complicated. The Department of Homeland Security is one of a number of federal agencies with something called administrative subpoena power, and it has been leveraging that tool in unprecedented ways under Trump 2.0. The Washington Post detailed these abuses this week, focusing on the story of a U.S. citizen targeted by DHS for simply emailing a federal prosecutor his opinion about the federal government’s case against an Afghan national facing deportation.

How can something like this happen? Congress has granted administrative subpoena power to federal agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to allow them to access information quickly to make decisions about issues under their purview. A key distinction between administrative subpoenas and civil or criminal ones is that federal agencies do not need a judge’s sign-off. These agencies retain the power to approve administrative subpoenas themselves. This also means that agencies can demand documents without needing to prove that there is an ongoing investigation into or probable cause against a person when issuing administrative subpoenas.

Federal agencies are not legally required to disclose how many administrative subpoenas they issue, but under the Trump administration, unnamed sources told the Post, the volume of administrative subpoenas is “well into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.” Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, authored a study on the immigration subpoena power and found, through publicly available regulations and internal records, that ICE has empowered its employees—even those focused on civil immigration enforcement—“to demand records and testimony from any person or entity in order to obtain information for any civil or criminal investigation within the agency’s broad domain.”

“At present, there is generally no requirement that officers have probable cause, identify the suspected violation, or exercise restraint,” Nash wrote. This is being exemplified with abuses like the one documented in the Post story, plus footage of federal agents taking pictures of protesters and threatening to add them to “a nice little database,” which some anonymous national security officials claim does in fact exist as a way for DHS and the FBI to track people labeled as “domestic terrorists.” (DHS publicly denies that there is such a database.)

The Trump administration’s heavy use of administrative subpoenas comes as the judiciary—including Republican-appointed judges—has been turning against its immigration enforcement tactics. Just this week, a court blocked the White House from ending temporary protected status for over 350,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., while the chief judge of the District of Minnesota concluded that ICE has most likely violated more court orders in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Administrative subpoenas are a convenient work-around for an administration that knows it faces an uphill battle if it takes its information requests to a judge, a process that requires a formal investigation. Instead of having to meet a strict legal standard, DHS can issue administrative subpoenas to private individuals, tech companies, schools, state governments, and other entities in order to access information about people it’s interested in targeting. It has already tried to take this path to acquire data on folks who track ICE in their local communities. Generally, targeted organizations do not have to notify individuals that their information is being sought by the federal government. However, these groups are not actually obliged to comply with these subpoenas absent judicial action. As Michelle Lapointe, legal director at American Immigration Council, told Slate, administrative subpoenas are not self-enforcing. “When people receive an administrative subpoena from ICE, technically they don’t have to respond,” she said. “The agency can go to court and seek the records to be compelled from the individual who is served with the subpoena. But it has to do that extra step to make it enforceable.”

Lapointe noted that oftentimes recipients of these subpoenas do end up complying out of fear, which DHS appears to be manipulating. The Post story, for instance, described what happened to the U.S. citizen who had emailed the federal prosecutor: Federal agents showed up at his doorstep after he failed to comply with an administrative subpoena. The agents questioned him about the email, asking how he had found the attorney’s email address—through a basic Google search. After about 20 minutes, the agents left.

Critically, tech companies, including Google and Meta, have received administration subpoenas since Trump took office last year, but it’s not always clear when they comply. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that it pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, while spokespeople for Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Snap told the Post their companies alert users about administrative subpoena requests unless they are barred from doing so or face extenuating circumstances.

In a case about six separate Instagram accounts that named and shamed a Border Patrol agent who was part of the Los Angeles immigration raids last summer, DHS sent Meta an administrative subpoena asking for the accounts’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers. In that instance, the Instagram account users were made aware of the subpoena, and a judge ordered Meta not to comply.

The issue here is that Americans are left to simply hope these tech companies operate in good faith and out of the goodness of their hearts, something that “should be alarming to all of us,” Lapointe noted. The threat remains that these companies may end up complying with DHS requests in order to get the administration off their backs, even when subpoenas are unwarranted. “I do think the acquiescence of tech and government makes it especially difficult as a functional matter to protect individual rights when you have administrative subpoena authority,” Dennis Fan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Attending a protest is a constitutionally protected right, as is writing an email that contains your political opinions, but the Trump administration is finding ways to use these actions against its citizens by leaning into third parties—aka Big Tech—who have access to your personal, identifying information. These are companies that have positioned themselves as friendly partners of the White House, given that many of the country’s tech billionaires personally donated to Trump’s inauguration, then were conspicuously seated in the front row.

Where does that leave the average American? The answer is complicated. Lapointe believes that the best thing we can do is remain aware of our constitutional rights and not let Big Tech get away with selling out Americans without a fight. “I think pressure can be brought to bear, the more we raise awareness that these requests could come through and that the tech companies might receive them, requesting your information,” Lapointe said. “Using public pressure campaigns to encourage them to resist these attempts to get at private information could be helpful.”

So if you exercise your First Amendment right to protest injustices you believe your government is committing, you risk being targeted by that very government. And if you don’t want Big Tech helping that government target you? You may have to be right back at that protest again.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/higgsfield_ai_job_loss/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first rule of AI-generated job loss is you don&#39;t talk about AI-generated job loss ... if you&#39;re the company that caused it. Higgsfield.ai, a startup offering AI video creation tools, recently generated outrage when it claimed it had caused artists to hit the unemployment line.

Earlier this week, the company bragged on X that its AI motion design tool put an end to more than 20 creative jobs.

The artists using its services – well aware of AI&#39;s impact on the creative market and perhaps discomfitted by their complicity for using these tools – were not amused and the ensuing backlash on social media led to the post&#39;s removal.

&quot;Seems like Higgsfield found out today that there are lines they just shouldn&#39;t cross in their marketing,&quot; wrote Aharon Rabinowitz, CEO of Motion Management, in a social media post. &quot;Celebrating the end of artists&#39; careers (even when their motion design tools are not actually good enough to render anyone unemployed) is just super dumb and shortsighted.&quot;

The company&#39;s marketing claims and the services it actually provides have been a matter of contention for several months. Online critics have accused the company of:

As one online critic put it, &quot;Higgsfield AI: A Company Built on Rage Bait Content, Stolen Likenesses, and Sexual Exploitation.&quot; Another has accused Higgsfield of commissioning customers to create marketing material using unlicensed intellectual property, to shift liability for potential infringement claims.

Higgsfield did not respond to requests for comment. A message to the company&#39;s email address for the press, cited in prior fundraising news, bounced. A message to the company&#39;s support email address said our inquiry had been forwarded to a human agent, but no one has followed up.

The Register also asked Menlo Ventures, one of the companies funding Higgsfield, to comment. A spokesperson for the VC firm did not comment as asked but provided a media contact who has yet to respond.

Ian Hudson, a UK-based software tester and video maker, spoke to The Register in a phone interview about the backlash against Higgsfield.

&quot;The problem seems to be that really they aren&#39;t providing much of a service themselves and it appears that a lot of the website really is just a wrapper for other services,&quot; Hudson explained. &quot;So it&#39;s doing API calls off to Google for Nano Banana and it&#39;s using a service called Kling for the video.&quot;

Hudson said that he became aware of the service in January because of the company&#39;s intensive marketing efforts. Higgsfield, he said, has been making promises about unlimited usage of services like Google Nano Banana and Kling.

&quot;But there&#39;s no explanation so you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on,&quot; he said. &quot;Either something&#39;s unlimited or it&#39;s not, but it turns out it&#39;s not unlimited. Really you&#39;re not getting anything unlimited, you&#39;re getting a quick trial of it. And then it turns out that&#39;s got terms and conditions [that say] if you do a lot of use of it, we&#39;ll ban you.&quot;

Hudson said Higgsfield puts user prompts in a queue that gets delayed for an arbitrary amount of time before being routed to the underlying third-party AI service.

&quot;So it appears to be unlimited, but then it&#39;s not because it&#39;s throttling things for so long to get a result back that you get a fraction of what you could get if you went to, say, Google Gemini directly,&quot; he explained. &quot;So it&#39;s not really a service that is fit for purpose.&quot;

Hudson also criticized the company for its approach to marketing, which he said involved making controversial posts to generate attention and drama, and then deleting the posts to hide the evidence.

And he took issue with the limitations imposed on refunds. Higgsfield, he said, refuses to give refunds if you&#39;ve used their services.

&quot;So essentially nobody can get a refund because the only way you can get a refund is if you don&#39;t touch the bleeding thing and work out if it actually works,&quot; he said, &quot;which as you can appreciate, that&#39;s just fundamentally unfair. And this is where the credit card companies are falling down because the credit card companies say, &#39;oh well we&#39;ve looked at terms and conditions and they&#39;re adhering to terms and conditions.&#39;&quot;

These sorts of complaints are rife on social media and in the company&#39;s Discord channel. A post on Thursday states, &quot;...it is evident that your marketing is deceptive and your service is non-functional.&quot;

The post goes on to complain about service unavailability, unacceptable latency (4-10 hours of wait time for a five-minute video), censorship errors, and false marketing.

Hudson took issue with the company&#39;s engagement-bait marketing strategy.

&quot;A lot of people go &#39;isn&#39;t it awesome that they&#39;re doing that!&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;No it&#39;s not. It&#39;s childish and it&#39;s unprofessional. But what they&#39;ve done in the last few days, it said something like, &#39;Our product&#39;s so great we&#39;ve been able to sack off twenty creators.&#39; Something along those lines. And because their entire community is creators, a lot of them got upset.&quot;

Robert Scoble, an internet influencer since before that was really a term, claimed in a social media post that he spoke with an individual behind the Higgsfield influencer network last week.

&quot;This guy is trying to capture attention in a world where none of us have any,&quot; he mused.

To quote Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray, &quot;There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot;

Bankruptcy, moral or financial, is pretty bad too. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/darpa_seeking_physicsdefying_photonic_computers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no lightweight matter. DARPA is putting about $35 million in total funding on the table in the hope that it will spur researchers to work around fundamental physical constraints and build much larger-scale photonic circuits that do more of the computing with light, not electronics.

A recent solicitation from the Department of Defense&#39;s research arm - the Photonic Integrated Circuit Architectures for Scalable System Objectives (PICASSO) - aims to scale photonics beyond today’s narrow demonstrations. Citing the need for more capable photonic systems, including those relevant to artificial intelligence workloads, DARPA is calling on researchers to submit proposals showing how circuit-level design can overcome the fundamental limitations that constrain current photonic computing approaches, using today’s photonic components rather than waiting for new ones to be invented.

For those unfamiliar with photonic computing, it&#39;s the use of light instead of electrons to process and transmit data. If that sounds far-fetched, it&#39;s not, as DARPA points out - there are already photonic circuits around today, albeit in limited form.

Using light to process data signals has advantages that are ideal for heavy workloads like AI due to greater bandwidth, less latency, and improved energy efficiency. Unfortunately, as DARPA points out, &quot;systems incorporating photonic circuits struggle to show significant system-level performance advantages over electronic systems.&quot;

The current generation of photonic circuits is limited in depth, which restricts their ability to do much beyond single linear mathematical operations. Individual photonic circuits included in larger systems also have to convert optical signals to electronic ones in order to hand them off to other components, essentially eliminating the advantage of nanosecond latency due to the millisecond latency of electronic circuits, which DARPA notes is a 106 performance degradation.

So, what&#39;s holding photonic circuits back aside from, according to DARPA, an industry focus on component-level research? Why, just physics of course.

&quot;The primary limitation to further scaling of circuit size and functionality is rooted in the fundamental properties of signaling with light,&quot; DARPA noted. Cool - easy fix, provided researchers can address the two fundamental technical challenges the research organization points out.

First there&#39;s signal degradation. Unlike metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits, which regenerate signals and filter out noise, photonic circuits have a fundamental issue of optical attenuation and noise that can&#39;t be amplified out, as any attempt to amplify optical signals also amplifies the noise.

Second, there&#39;s the issue of spurious wave interference, which leads to scattering, coupling, mode leakage, back reflections, and unwanted resonance. &quot;Over many components, control of these errors becomes unpredictable, especially when combined with manufacturing variability and thermal and environmental instabilities,&quot; DARPA explained.

Overcoming those limitations, as mentioned above, has traditionally resulted in photonic circuits being interfaced with electronic ones, and DARPA doesn&#39;t want that.

&quot;Heavy usage of electronics prevents system-level gains in latency, efficiency, and bandwidth offered natively by photonics,&quot; the agency said.

Here&#39;s where PICASSO comes in: What DARPA wants from its chosen participants is, like resolving the limitations imposed by the physics of light, simple: Just make better circuits so those two technical challenges aren&#39;t an issue anymore.

&quot;Drawing inspiration from modern electronics, in which clever circuit design overcomes the limitations of individual transistors, the program will foster innovative circuit-level strategies to achieve unprecedented system performance and stability,&quot; DARPA said. &quot;PICASSO confronts these challenges by embracing a new paradigm: creating tomorrow&#39;s photonic circuits using today&#39;s components.&quot;

DARPA isn&#39;t just soliciting ideas, either. By the time PICASSO phase 1 wraps up, 18 months after it kicks off in July, DARPA wants a &quot;demonstration of predictable performance of photonic circuits,&quot; and by the end of phase 2 (an additional 18 month period), it expects &quot;generalized circuit functionality&quot; to be demonstrated.

It also expects all that within a total program budget of about $35 million, spread across multiple awards. Proposals are due by March 6 - good luck. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four tech megacorps intend to collectively fork out roughly $635 billion this year on capex, much of it for datacenters and AI infrastructure – more than the entire output of Israel&#39;s economy and well beyond all global cloud infrastructure services revenue generated last year.

The tech titans are all trying to outdo each other by spending eye-watering amounts on capex, the majority of which will go on AI and cloud expansion, but the big four – AWS, Microsoft, Google and Meta – are investing at a different scale.

Amazon says it expects to spend $200 billion in 2026, with most of that headed to AWS. Google is aiming to pump $180 billion into building and equipping datacenters, while Meta expects capex in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion, and Microsoft is running at a pace that implies around $120 billion a year in spending.

That adds up to $635 billion, more than the $610 billion that represented Israel&#39;s entire gross domestic product during 2025, and approaching that of Sweden at $662 billion, according to figures from the IMF.

These extraordinary sums show how far the industry leaders are willing to go to gain some kind of advantage in the AI race, even though returns on all the spending have so far failed to live up to expectations, and investors are reportedly getting restless. Microsoft&#39;s share price fell about 10 percent after its recent results were announced, for example, due to investors expecting a bigger payoff.

The wider cost for users? The massive splurge on infrastructure is driving shortages of components like memory as manufacturers prioritize chip production that cashes in on the lucrative datacenter market, rather than those for everyday PCs and phones.

The huge capex pledges also add up to more than total cloud infrastructure services revenue in 2025. According to the latest figures from Synergy Research Group, the revenues reached $419 billion last year.

This is despite the cloud market itself continuing to grow at an impressive pace, running at about 30 percent year-on-year and marking a ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

&quot;GenAI has simply put the cloud market into overdrive,&quot; said Synergy Research Group chief analyst John Dinsdale. &quot;AI-specific services account for much of the growth since 2022, but AI technology has also enhanced the broader portfolio of cloud services, driving revenue growth across the board. The leading cloud providers have all seen their revenue growth rates jump.&quot;

The big three clouds continue to dominate with Synergy putting their shares of the worldwide market in Q4 2025 at 28 percent for Amazon (AWS), 21 percent for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud at 14 percent.

Among the tier-two cloud providers, those with the highest growth rates include CoreWeave, Oracle, Crusoe, and Nebius, all providers of AI infrastructure services. In particular, CoreWeave is now generating more than $1.5 billion in quarterly cloud revenue and has joined the top ten cloud providers, Synergy says. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Legacy image-sharing website Flickr suffered a data breach, according to customers emails seen by The Register.

The hack transpired on February 5, an email to customers stated, and the company said it &quot;shut down access to the affected system within hours of learning about it.&quot;

The security issue stemmed from a third-party email service provider, the identity of which was not specified.

In the email, Flickr said it disabled access to the affected system and removed all links to the vulnerable endpoint before notifying its email provider and demanding an investigation into the incident.

&quot;We are conducting a thorough review and strengthening our security practices with third-party providers,&quot; Flickr&#39;s email stated. &quot;We notified the relevant data protection authorities.&quot;

As for the all-important &#39;what data was taken&#39; question, it&#39;s the usual personally identifiable information (PII) and a few other less-expected markers.

Thge message to custokers states that names, email addresses, usernames, account types, IP addresses and general locations, and Flickr activity were potentially accessed by hackers. What data is exposed, as always, depends on each given account. It won&#39;t be the same for everyone.

The Register asked the SmugMug-owned company for more information, including how many of its users were affected.

Since Flickr included links to both European and US data protection authorities in its email, potentially indicating the impact was felt in multiple regions. Flickr operates in 190 countries.

As for its number of active users, Flickr&#39;s advertising arm says 35 million per month are contributing to the site, generating 800 million page views. Approximately 228,000 of these were in Europe, a Digital Services Act publication confirmed.

The company&#39;s email warned users to beware of phishing emails referencing their account and reminded them that the real Flickr would never ask for things like passwords via email.

It also suggested users review their account settings for any unexpected findings, and if they use the same password for Flickr as they do for other services, to consider changing it.

Flickr&#39;s email said no password or financial information was affected, though.

&quot;We sincerely apologize for this incident and for the concern it may cause,&quot; the company said in the email.

&quot;We take the privacy and security of your data extremely seriously, and we are taking immediate action to prevent any similar issues by conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our system architecture, and further enhancing our monitoring of third-party service providers.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/uk_climbs_up_ddos_hit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cloudflare says DDoS crews ended 2025 by pushing traffic floods to new extremes, while Britain made an unwelcome leap of 36 places to become the world&#39;s sixth-most targeted location.

The Q4 stats confirm it was a lively year for traffic floods, with Cloudflare claiming it had to swat away 47.1 million DDoS attacks, more than double 2024&#39;s count. Momentum picked up toward the end of the year, as Q4 volumes jumped 31 percent from the prior quarter and 58 percent over 2024.

Aisuru-Kimwolf, a botnet made up largely of malware-infected Android TVs, was behind the largest blast of the quarter, pushing traffic to a record-breaking 31.4 Tbps. The campaign, dubbed &quot;The Night Before Christmas,&quot; kicked off on December 19 and targeted Cloudflare customers as well as Cloudflare&#39;s own dashboard and infrastructure in parallel.

&quot;As the number of attacks increased over the course of 2025, the size of the attacks increased as well, growing by over 700 percent compared to the large attacks seen in late 2024,&quot; Cloudflare said.

Scale isn&#39;t the only thing shifting, as Cloudflare reports that attackers are ditching long-haul floods in favour of smash-and-dash traffic spikes. Some incidents during the campaign wrapped up in well under two minutes yet still pushed traffic into the billions of packets per second, underscoring how sheer speed has become the real weapon.

Cloudflare attributes much of the surge to large botnets built from compromised internet-connected devices, including routers, cameras, and DVRs. The company also says attackers are increasingly abusing cloud-hosted virtual machines to generate large bursts of traffic, allowing them to scale attacks quickly.

The geographic shifts are equally notable. While China, Hong Kong, Germany, Brazil, and the United States remained among the most frequently targeted regions, the United Kingdom&#39;s sudden rise to number six stands out.

Cloudflare doesn&#39;t attribute the UK&#39;s climb to any single campaign, though the country is in several well-known DDoS crosshairs. Financial services remain a favourite target, and geopolitical tensions are adding fresh fuel. Pro-Russian hacktivists NoName057(16), for example, have repeatedly claimed responsibility for attacks on UK government and public sector websites. Britain&#39;s dense telecoms and cloud infrastructure also make it a high-impact disruption target.

Attackers didn&#39;t stray far from their favourite punching bags. Telecom providers, IT service firms, and gambling and gaming sites once again absorbed a big slice of the DDoS noise, sectors where outages tend to trigger both lost cash and loud complaints. Most assaults also stuck to the lower plumbing of the internet, with Layer 3 and Layer 4 attacks leading the charge.

Cloudflare says the only realistic way to keep up is to let the machines handle it, with autonomous systems detecting and blocking massive, short-lived attacks in real time without human intervention. The logic is fairly simple: when traffic surges to record levels and then vanishes within a couple of minutes, humans will never react quickly enough. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An enterprising engineer has evoked the spirit of Acorn&#39;s BBC Micro with a custom paintjob for a Raspberry Pi 500+ computer-in-a-keyboard and a natty set of replacement keycaps.

You&#39;ve got a shiny new Raspberry Pi 500+. You&#39;ve marveled at the colored lights on the keyboard, enjoyed the snappy performance of the SSD, and appreciated the 16 GB of RAM. Hopefully, you bought it before the prices went up. But what to do next?

Raspberry Pi 500+ painted beige with BBC Micro-like keys (pic: Raspberry Pi) - Click to enlarge

According to Tony Roberts, who goes by the title of &#39;Maker In Residence at Raspberry Pi&#39;, he wanted to make the device look a bit like the BBC Microcomputer that inspired the company&#39;s co-founder, Eben Upton.

BBC Micro emulators are nothing new (alongside emulators for other computers of the same era), and several enthusiasts have breathed new life into defunct devices by removing the long-dead internals and replacing them with a Pi or similar device. This writer attempted something akin with an old Texas Instruments 99/4a, but was defeated by a combination of making the keyboard talk to the Pi via an Arduino and some catastrophically bad soldering.

However, since the Pi 500+ is already a computer-in-a-keyboard, and the keys can be easily replaced (to the point where a tool is included to pry them off), Roberts&#39; approach was to give the computer a beige facelift and replace the keycaps with ones that resembled Acorn&#39;s finest.

In a post on the company&#39;s website, Roberts wrote, &quot;Within minutes of starting the makeover, I discovered that beige spray paint is unsurprisingly not very popular anymore — especially this exact shade, which reminds me of nicotine-stained pub wallpaper.&quot;

But, after dismantling the case (the Pi 500+ is designed to be taken apart), Roberts applied primer, a top coat, and had a base that, from a distance and with a bit of squinting, was roughly the same shade as the computers sat at the back of school classrooms all those decades ago.

The keycaps came from Signature Plastics, but since the Pi 500+ uses a standard keycap, there are plenty of options out there. Roberts selected one that comes remarkably close to the color and style of the original. However, we suspect a bit of software keymapping in the operating system is needed for some of them.

Considering the sheer number of computer-in-a-keyboard machines from the heyday of home computers, Roberts has demonstrated how easy it is to pull off a keyboard switcheroo and use a can of paint to evoke a strong sense of nostalgia (or is it just the paint fumes?). Sure, it&#39;s a $260 investment (thanks to rising memory prices), but it&#39;s also a neat way of showing off an IT origin story.

There&#39;s no word on whether Raspberry Pi might put out a limited-edition run of Roberts&#39; creation to mark its own origin story. In the meantime, a bit of brushed metal and some Texas Instruments 99/4a keycaps would do nicely... ®

A rumored update would open the door for voice-controlled third-party AI apps.

CarPlay users could soon be able to use their chatbot of choice instead of Siri. As Bloomberg reports, Apple is working to add support for CarPlay voice control apps from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. Previously, users who wanted to access third-party chatbots in the car would need to go through their iPhone, but soon they may be able to talk with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini directly in CarPlay.

However, Apple reportedly “won’t let users replace the Siri button on CarPlay or the wake word that summons the service.” So, users will need to manually open their preferred chatbot’s app. Developers will be able to set their apps to automatically start voice mode whenever they’re opened, though, which could help streamline the experience.

According to Bloomberg, the addition of third-party chatbots in CarPlay could roll out “within the coming months,” but hasn’t been officially announced yet. The rumored update follows Apple’s announcement last month that Google Gemini will power an updated version of Siri, which is slated to arrive sometime this year.

            <div id="article-text">I spoke to two Trump Mobile executives for an exclusive first look at what they say is the T1 Phone.

I spoke to two Trump Mobile executives for an exclusive first look at what they say is the T1 Phone.

Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts. This time, surprisingly, we received a response — and an interview.

The Trump phone is real — maybe, sort of, soon? — and I’ve seen it. Not in the flesh, but during an hourlong video call with two Trump Mobile executives who showed me a phone, and told me more about why it was delayed, when it might actually reach buyers, and why its spec sheet has changed again and again.

I spoke to Don Hendrickson — yes, the one who had seemingly ghosted me last time — and Eric Thomas, two of the three executives that run Trump Mobile. The T1 Phone that Thomas shows me over Google Meet isn’t a final production model, but apparently it’s close. The T1 logo — seen since the first renders of the phone — will apparently be dropped before launch, though the American flag at the bottom will remain, as will the signature gold finish.

It’s clear from a glance that this isn’t the same phone the company teased eight months ago. The iPhone-esque camera triangle has been replaced by three lenses laid out vertically in a black, oval island with “Trump Mobile” written alongside. Look closer and you’ll see those lenses are unevenly spaced.

The phone is different in a few other ways from both the version that was announced in June 2025 and the altered spec sheet that appeared on the Trump Mobile website a couple of weeks later. It looks larger, with the “waterfall” display (curved screens are back, baby) appearing closer to the 6.78-inch screen originally promised than the 6.25-inch model that appeared a little later.

It will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 series chipset, usually used in upper-midrange devices, and include a 5,000mAh battery, 512GB of storage, and support for up to 1TB microSD cards. I don’t know the full camera spec just yet, but I was told that both the selfie camera and the main rear camera are using 50-megapixel sensors, and a glimpse of the camera UI suggests the inclusion of an ultrawide lens and perhaps a telephoto, neither of which had been listed before.

“This actual phone does spec with the top-of-the-line phones in the market this year,” Thomas says, later claiming it will be comparable to “any phone that’s over $1,000.” I’m not entirely sure that’s true, given you can find comparable specs, even the 50-megapixel selfie camera, in the OnePlus Nord 5, which ships with 512GB storage in the UK for £499 — around $679. Much will depend on camera performance and whether it includes flagship touches like waterproofing or wireless charging, which I don’t yet know. But it is true that some specs — the selfie camera resolution, the storage capacity, the ultrawide lens — are improved from the T1 Phone we saw (or didn’t) at launch.

To reflect that alleged improvement in quality, a price hike is coming. Hendrickson is quick to emphasize that everyone who placed a $100 deposit already (he wouldn’t tell me how many had done so) will still pay $499 total, but they’re now calling that an “introductory price.” Later buyers will pay more, though “less than $1,000” is all the pair would confirm, with the final price apparently still to be decided.

So why all the changes? To hear Thomas and Hendrickson put it, there was so much interest in the T1 Phone that it only felt right to make the phone better by jumping forward a little in their long-term plans. “Let’s skip our first initial entry-level phone that we were going to kind of introduce and be quick to the market,” Thomas says of the company’s thinking following the early media attention. “Let’s take our time and do what we were planning to be the next step.”

The pair suggest the decision to re-spec the phone is behind some, though not all, of its delays — the T1 Phone is now six months late to launch. Still, they say it’s coming soon. The phone has apparently cleared FCC certification (itself supposedly slowed by the government shutdown) and is now awaiting certification with T-Mobile, expected to complete sometime in mid-March. After that, Thomas says the company will be ready to ship phones to early buyers, though he’s hesitant to commit to an exact date. For a phone that was first promised for August or September, then by the end of 2025, and still only says “later this year” on the official website, I would take any launch timeline with a fistful of salt.

Still, it sounds like we’ll see more soon regardless. The two executives promise that a Trump Mobile “relaunch” is coming, and that within “the next couple of weeks” the website will be updated with images of the final phone, along with its spec sheet. Our long wait is nearly over.

Of course, there’s one thing the T1 Phone won’t be: made in the USA. Instead, the handsets go through “final assembly” in Miami, though Thomas is careful not to say too much about what that means. It’s more than “slapping a cover on the phone,” and apparently involves putting together the final 10 or so pieces. The pair won’t say where the bulk of the phone is assembled prior to that, only that it’s done in a “favored nation,” which essentially seems to be a way of saying “not China.”

To call a product “made in the USA” you have to meet certain standards, laid down and enforced by the FTC. The Trump Mobile site instead currently promises that there are “American hands behind every device,” and Thomas says that the wording was chosen because they “want to be upfront and not misleading at all to people.” He admits that there “might have been something put on the website” in error at launch (in this case, a huge homepage banner that said the T1 is “MADE IN THE USA” and a press release that said it’s “proudly designed and built in the United States”), but that since then “we’ve kind of stayed away from that.”

Full assembly in the US is still what the pair call a “goal,” though, one they’re apparently working on for future phones like the T1 Ultra — yes, that’s apparently real too, though they wouldn’t tell me much more about it.

I guess we’ll have to keep waiting, but until then: The Trump phone is real (ish), I’ve seen it (sort of), and it’s finally going to launch next month (maybe).

            <div id="article-text">﻿What does the Amazon founder even get out of owning the Post?

﻿What does the Amazon founder even get out of owning the Post?

300 journalists have lost their jobs at The Washington Post. Over 300,000 readers have canceled their subscriptions. Owner Jeff Bezos, who purchased the legendary publication in 2013, has driven his reputation into the ground by using his vast empire to churn out content designed to make President Donald Trump happy: Amazon MGM Studios spent $40 million to produce a fawning documentary about Melania Trump, which premiered days before the Post sent out mass layoff notices. And yet, he’s gotten nothing out of his attempts to suck up to Donald Trump — at least, nothing that’s a net positive to his bottom line.

Which begs the cynical question: Why does he even own The Washington Post at all?

The Trump era is, after all, a cynical and transactional time. Billionaires, CEOs, and world leaders have quickly learned that sucking up to Trump will get them what they want — pardons, tariff exemption, an export control lifted, a merger deal approved, an investigation quashed. And when it comes to media companies, the Paramount-Skydance merger has set the bar for sucking up to Trump. In order for the merger to get regulatory approval, Skydance CEO David Ellison pushed CBS to settle a defamation suit filed by Trump, canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and hired Bari Weiss, a right-wing Substacker with virtually no newsroom leadership experience, as CBS News’s editor-in-chief. In short, Ellison had to commit to neutering CBS’s ability to criticize Trump. But he did get a $28 billion merger out of it.

Bezos’ media plays, on the other hand, seem self-contradictory. Financing a fawning documentary about Melania Trump does not mesh with owning a media company with a 150-year-old legacy of holding politicians accountable, especially one that famously held Trump accountable during his first administration. (If the goal was to neuter the Post too, then bafflingly, his deputy, Will Lewis, fired everyone except for those on the political desks.) Even his attempt to separate the political opinions from the Post’s journalism, an attempt to have it both ways, backfired. After he announced that the opinion page would now reflect more conservative views, reporters began leaving the Post in droves, and subscriber numbers plummeted even further. As the Post’s former editor-in-chief Marty Baron put it in a column shortly after the layoffs, it was “near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”

One could argue — as WaPo insiders have to media reporters — that the layoffs were necessary because the paper was losing money. But billionaires have plenty of face-saving ways to get an unprofitable media outlet off their hands, in a manner that does not include mass layoffs (or at least, offloads the layoffs onto its next owner). The Philadelphia Inquirer, for instance, had been donated by its billionaire owner to a nonprofit, while Facebook billionaire Chris Hughes ended up selling The New Republic to Win McCormack after his own failed attempt to reshape the 100-year-old magazine. The Post, which had grown its digital audience throughout Bezos’ ownership, would have immediately attracted buyers: last year, tech journalist Kara Swisher announced that she and several investors were prepared to purchase the Post from Bezos, but reportedly never heard back from him.

Perhaps Bezos needs to suck up to Trump to further Amazon’s interests, which would make more sense if Bezos still ran the company. Except he doesn’t. He stepped down as CEO in 2021. Amazon, whose subsidiary AWS holds the lion’s share of federal government contracts, has been able to independently suck up to Trump via donations to the White House’s new ballroom fund. (Admittedly, Bezos’ government contracts with NASA are on the table, and he was reportedly spotted hanging out with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a Blue Origin facility in Florida on the day of the Post layoffs.)

Maybe this pile of self-contradictions — or, as he once described his ownership of the Post, a “complexifier” — was inevitable when Trump came back into office and made it clear that he would punish the Big Tech entities that displeased him. But there’s no clear and logical explanation for why Bezos is going about his supplication: not one that makes financial sense, nor one that immediately furthers his own political standing with Trump, nor one that reaffirms the commitment he once made to protecting the First Amendment. And that lack of clarity only makes the Post’s decapitation even more senseless.

Epic Games says a player changed their account name to ‘littlestjeff1’ after the alias was found in the Epstein files.

Fortnite developer Epic Games says the account some people believed to be linked to Jeffrey Epstein is a “ruse.” In a reply on X, the developer writes, “an existing Fortnite account owner changed their username” to “littlestjeff1,” an alias spotted in several emailed receipts from YouTube in the Epstein files.

The email suggests that “littlestjeff1” may have been connected to Epstein’s YouTube account, prompting online sleuths to search for the username on other platforms. Users later uncovered a “littlestjeff1” account on Fortnite, along with a 2019 email that mentions purchasing VBucks in Fortnite — though the sender and recipient are redacted. Online player databases showed that the “littlestjeff1” account has been active on Fortnite, fueling conspiracy theories that Epstein is still alive.

But Epic Games has since debunked these claims, saying that a Fortnite player changed their name “following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube.” The company adds that the Fortnite trackers, where people uncovered the alias, “only display your current name, not any prior changes to it,” and that it has “no record” of Epstein’s email addresses mentioned in the files.

“Someone’s been having fun renaming their Fortnite account, but it’s recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says on X.

If you know where to look, you can often score deals on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the newer AirPods Pro 3. And while recent shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday delivered some of the steepest discounts we’ve seen, there are still good deals to be found on every model in January.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each set of AirPods, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the third-gen AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.

At the end of 2024, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.

The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.

Given they’ve been out for over a year, we consistently see discounts for both iterations of the AirPods 4. During Black Friday, we saw the standard model drop to a new low of $74. But right now, they’re $99 ($30 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. The AirPods 4 with ANC are $139.99 at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $139.99, which is well above their all-time low of $99.

The third-gen AirPods Pro add a new built-in heart rate sensor and live translation feature. They also improve upon their predecessor with enhanced noise cancellation, improved sound quality, and a fifth swappable ear tip.

At its “Awe Dropping” event in September, Apple introduced the AirPods Pro 3. In addition to improved ANC and sound, the third-gen earbuds include a built-in heart rate sensor that syncs with the iPhone Fitness app, allowing you to track your pulse and calories burned across more than 50 workout types. They’re also more comfortable and secure than their predecessor, thanks to a redesigned, angled fit and five ear tip sizes — including a new XXS option. Additionally, they carry a more robust IP57 rating and support Apple’s new live translation feature, which, in our testing, generally conveys the gist well but still can’t beat a human interpreter.

Given how recently they launched, we’ve been surprised by how frequently the AirPods Pro 3 have been discounted. Recently, we saw the AirPods Pro 3 drop to as low as $199, which was less than their Black Friday and Cyber Monday price. As of this update, they’re available for $229.99 (about $19 off) at Amazon and Walmart.

The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.

Toward the end of 2024, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. In the past, we’ve seen them drop to as low as $399, but right now they’re only on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $449.99 ($100 off), which is still one of their better prices to date.

            <h2>Moltbook was peak AI theater</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132319/experimental-surgery-colorectal-cancer-survivors-pregnant-birth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

Market reaction has been noticeable: UiPath’s shares ticked higher in early trading after the announcement, suggesting investors see value in bolstering the company’s presence in financial-services automation. The acquisition underscores a broader trend in enterprise software where automation and AI are no longer siloed tools but woven into core business functions like risk and compliance.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.
