            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As a Windows system built inside of a functioning membrane keyboard, the HP EliteBoard G1a announced today is a more accessible alternative to other keyboard-PCs.

The Commodore 64 made the keyboard-PC famous in the 1980s, but the keyboard-PC space has been dominated by the Raspberry Pi. In 2019, the single-board computer (SBC) maker released the Raspberry Pi 400, which is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC inside a case that also functions as a keyboard for the system. USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, plus a GPIO header and native Raspberry Pi OS Linux distribution add up to a low-end desktop computer experience that only costs $100. Then the Raspberry Pi 500 with a Pi 5 powered by a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 inside, and the Pi 500+, which has NVMe SSD, instead of microSD, storage, and is built inside of a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also twice as expensive at $200).

But Raspberry Pis largely appeal to tinkerers, DIYers, and Linux fans, making Pi-as-a-desktop a niche product with a substantial learning curve for newcomers.

Alternatively, HP’s EliteBoard will bring Windows and a more powerful x86 architecture to the keyboard-PC form factor. HP says the EliteBoard will support Windows 11 Pro for Business and an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series processor with up to 50 TOPs NPU. The device will be sold with a 32 W internal battery and is part of Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC program.

The EliteBoard is aimed at workplaces that would benefit from ultraportable computers that can be quickly set up, such as corporate offices where employees don’t have assigned seats (also known as hot desking). In its announcement, HP said that the EliteBoard, which weighs 1.65 pounds, was built to “move, connect, and adapt to any workspace with ease.”

HP hasn’t released further specs, but based on what we do know, the EliteBoard will have limited computing power, especially compared to other Windows 11 business PCs. Still, the unique system is set to bring new capabilities and a familiar interface to keyboard-PCs. It could garner deeper interest for the category from IT departments seeking easy hybrid workplace solutions, makers, and minimalists interested in experimenting,

HP is demoing the keyboard-PC at CES 2026 in Las Vegas this week and plans to release it in March. It hasn’t set a price yet.</div>

            <h2>With GeForce Super GPUs missing in action, Nvidia focuses on software upgrades</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/nvidia-leans-on-dlss-improvements-to-make-up-for-a-lack-of-gpus-at-ces/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang’s characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed 90-minute keynote focused almost entirely on the company’s dominant AI business, relegating the company’s gaming-related announcements to a separate video posted later in the evening.

Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia’s basket of upscaling and frame generation technologies.

DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new “second-generation transformer model” that Nvidia says has been “trained on an expanded data set” to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia’s Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it’s working from a lower-resolution source image.

DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is also improving, increasing the number of AI-generated frames per rendered frame from three to five. This new 6x mode for DLSS MFG is being paired with something called Dynamic Multi-Frame Generation, where the number of AI-generated frames can dynamically change, increasing generated frames during “demanding scenes,” and decreasing the number of generated frames during simpler scenes “so it only computes what’s needed.”

The standard caveats for Multi-Frame Generation still apply: It still needs an RTX 50-series GPU (the 40-series can still only generate one frame for every rendered frame, and older cards can’t generate extra frames at all), and the game still needs to be running at a reasonably high base frame rate to minimize lag and weird rendering artifacts. It remains a useful tool for making fast-running games run faster, but it won’t help make an unplayable frame rate into a playable one.

To Nvidia’s credit, the new DLSS 4.5 transformer model runs on GeForce 20- and 30-series GPUs, giving users of older-but-still-usable graphics cards access to the improved upscaling. But Nvidia said that owners of those GPUs would see more of a performance hit from enabling DLSS 4.5 than users of GeForce 40- and 50-series cards would, and initial testing from some outlets seems to be bearing that out. Compared to the DLSS 4.0 transformer model, Mostly Positive Reviews found that the new DLSS 4.5 model reduced performance on an RTX 3080 Ti by between 14 and 24 percent depending on the game and the settings, though performance is still presumably better than it would be on the same card if you tried to run those games at native resolutions.

The DLSS 4.5 transformer model is available now, after a driver update, and you can use the Nvidia App to select the new transformer model in games that already support DLSS upscaling (whether the option appears in any in-game menus remains up to the game developer). The Multi-Frame Generation updates will be available sometime in spring 2026.

One feature that hasn’t broken cover yet? Nvidia’s Reflex 2, an update to its input lag reduction technology that the company announced at CES last year. Upscaling and frame generation technologies generally, something that Reflex helps to offset, and the company claimed an up to 75 percent reduction in lag when using Reflex 2 on a 50-series card. But Nvidia didn’t mention Reflex 2 this year, and hasn’t provided any updates on when it might be released.

In another era, CES 2026 would have been a good time to introduce a 50-series Super update, a mid-generation spec bump to keep the lineup fresh while Nvidia works on whatever will become the GeForce 60-series. The company used CES 2024 to launch the RTX 40-series Super cards, helping improve the value proposition for a bunch of cards that had launched at prices many reviewers and users grumbled about.

Indeed, the rumor mill suggested that Nvidia was working on a 50-series Super refresh for the 2025 holiday season, and its biggest improvement was going to be a 50 percent bump in RAM capacity, said to be possible because of a switch from 2GB RAM chips to 3GB chips. This would have given the theoretical 5070 Super 18GB of RAM, and the 5070 Ti Super and 5080 Super were said to have 24GB of memory.

Assuming those rumors are correct, those plans could have been dashed by the abrupt RAM shortages and price spikes that started late last year. These have been caused at least in part by sky-high demand for RAM from AI data centers; given that modern-day Nvidia is mainly an AI company that sells consumer GPUs on the side, it stands to reason that the company would allocate all the RAM it can get to its more profitable AI GPUs, rather than a mid-generation GeForce refresh.

In fact, none of the major dedicated GPU manufacturers has introduced new products at CES this year. AMD and Intel announced products with improved integrated GPUs, which use system RAM rather than requiring their own. But there wasn’t a peep about any new dedicated Radeon cards, and Intel hasn’t introduced a new dedicated Arc graphics card in almost a year, despite some signs that a midrange Arc B770 card exists and could be nearly ready to launch.</div>

            <h2>Letting prisons jam contraband phones is a bad idea, phone companies tell FCC</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/letting-prisons-jam-contraband-phones-is-a-bad-idea-phone-companies-tell-fcc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Federal Communications Commission proposal to let state and local prisons jam contraband cell phones has support from Republican attorneys general and prison phone companies but faces opposition from wireless carriers that say it would disrupt lawful communications. Groups dedicated to Wi-Fi and GPS also raised concerns in comments to the FCC.

“Jamming will block all communications, not just communications from contraband devices,” wireless lobby group CTIA said in December 29 comments in response to Chairman Brendan Carr’s proposal. The CTIA said that “jamming blocks all communications, including lawful communications such as 911 calling,” and argued that the FCC “has no authority to allow jamming.”

CTIA members AT&T and Verizon expressed their displeasure in separate comments to the FCC. “The proposed legal framework is based on a flawed factual premise,” AT&T wrote.

While the Communications Act prohibits interference with authorized radio communications, Carr’s plan tries to sidestep this prohibition by proposing to de-authorize certain communications, AT&T wrote. “This legal framework, however, is premised on a fundamental factual error: the assumption that jammers will only block ‘unauthorized’ communications without impacting lawful uses. There is no way to jam some communications on a spectrum band but not others,” AT&T wrote.

Previous FCC leaders recognized the problem that radio jammers can’t differentiate between contraband and legitimate devices, AT&T said. “As explained above, there are no technical workarounds to that limitation with respect to jammers,” AT&T wrote.

In 2013, the FCC explained that jamming systems transmit on the same frequencies as their targets in order to disrupt the links between devices and network base stations and that this process “render[s] any wireless device operating on those frequencies unusable. When used to disrupt wireless devices, radio signal jammers cannot differentiate between contraband devices and legitimate devices, including devices making 911 calls. Radio signal jammers block all wireless communications on affected spectrum bands.”

That apparently hasn’t changed. The FCC’s new proposal issued in September 2025 said the commission’s “understanding is that jamming solutions block calls on all affected frequencies and… are unable to allow 911 calls to be transmitted.” But the proposal indicates this may be an acceptable outcome, as “some state DOC [Department of Corrections] officials have indicated that correctional facilities typically do not allow any calls from within, including emergency calls.”

If the FCC adopts its plan, it would “authorize, for the first time, non-federal operation of radio frequency (RF) jamming solutions in correctional facilities,” the proposal said.

Carr said in September that previous FCC actions, such as authorizing “contraband interdiction systems” and letting wireless carriers disable contraband phones at a prison’s request, have not been enough. “Contraband cellphones have been pouring into state and local prisons by the tens of thousands every year,” Carr said. “They are used to run drug operations, orchestrate kidnappings, and further criminal enterprises in communities all across the country.”

Carr said that prisons and jails will not be required to install jamming systems and that the FCC “proposes to authorize targeted jamming. Jamming technology can be precise enough that it does not interrupt the regular communications of law enforcement or community members in the vicinity.” The FCC proposal asks the public for comment on “restrictions that might prove necessary to ensure that jamming solutions are limited to this targeted use, and to mitigate the risk that these solutions are deployed in contexts other than a correctional facility environment.”

Jamming has support from 23 state attorneys general, all Republicans, who told the FCC that “inmates routinely use smuggled phones to coordinate criminal enterprises, intimidate witnesses, and orchestrate violence both inside and outside prison walls.” More jamming support came from the state Department of Corrections in both Florida and South Carolina.

Prison phone companies that would financially benefit from increased use of official phone systems also support jamming cell phones. Global Tel*Link (aka ViaPath) called the plan “one more tool to help combat the serious problem of contraband wireless devices in correctional facilities.”

NCIC Correctional Services, another prison phone firm, said that jamming to create “‘dead zones’ within correctional facilities would permit smaller jails to restrict contraband device access where it is not cost-effective to install managed access systems.” Detection Innovation Group, which sells inmate-tracking technology to prisons and jails, also urged the FCC to allow jamming.

Telecom industry groups say that limiting the effect of jamming will be difficult or impossible. The harms identified over a decade ago “remain the same today, although their effects are magnified by the increased use of wireless devices for broadband,” said the Telecommunications Industry Association, a standards-development group. “If an RF jamming solution is deployed at a correctional facility, such deployment risks not only interfering with voice communications but disrupting vital broadband services as well within the facility itself as well as the surrounding community.”

Verizon told the FCC that the Communications Act “requires more restrictive use of jamming devices than the NPRM [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking] proposes.” The CTIA argued that jamming isn’t necessary because the wireless industry already offers Managed Access Systems (MAS) as “a safe and effective contraband interdiction ecosystem.”

A Managed Access System establishes “a private cellular network that captures communications (voice, text, data) on commercial wireless frequencies within a correctional facility, determines whether that exchange is coming from or going to a contraband device, and, if so, prevents those communications from connecting to the wireless provider’s network,” the CTIA said. “At the same time, MAS allows communications to and from approved devices to be transmitted without interruption, including 911 and public safety calls within the correctional facility.”

More opposition came from the Wi-Fi Alliance, a tech industry group that tests and certifies interoperability of Wi-Fi products. The FCC proposal failed to “address the potential impact of such jamming on lawfully operating Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices,” the group told the FCC.

The FCC plan is not limited to jamming of phones on spectrum licensed for the exclusive use of wireless carriers. The FCC additionally sought comment on whether contraband devices operating on Wi-Fi airwaves and other unlicensed spectrum should be subject to jamming. That’s concerning to the Wi-Fi Alliance because Wi-Fi operates on unlicensed spectrum that is shared by many users.

“Accordingly, declaring that a jammer on unlicensed spectrum is permitted to disrupt the communications of another device also operating on unlicensed spectrum is contrary to the foundational principle of Part 15 [of FCC rules], under which all unauthorized devices must cooperate in the use of spectrum,” the group said. “Moreover, authorizing the use of jamming equipment in unlicensed spectrum pursuant to Part 15 would undermine decades of global spectrum policy, weaken trust in license-exempt technologies by providing no assurance that devices using those technologies will work, and set a dangerous precedent for the intentional misuse of unlicensed spectrum.”

Letting jammers interfere with Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices would effectively turn the jammers into “a de facto licensed service, operating with primary status in bands that are designated for unlicensed use,” the Wi-Fi Alliance said. “To achieve that undesirable result, the Commission would be required to change the Table of Frequency Allocations and issue authorizations for operations on unlicensed spectrum (just as it contemplates for the use of cell phone spectrum in jamming devices). That outcome would upend the premise of Part 15 operations.”

The GPS Innovation Alliance, another industry group, warned that even if the FCC imposes strict limits on transmission power and out-of-band emissions, “jammer transmissions can have spillover effects on adjacent and nearby band operations. Only specialized, encrypted signals, and specialized receivers and devices designed to decrypt those signals, are jam-resistant, in contrast to how most commercial technologies work.”

Now that public comments are in, Carr has to decide whether to move ahead with the plan as originally written, scrap it entirely, or come up with a compromise that might address some of the concerns raised by opponents. The FCC’s NPRM suggests a pilot program could be used to evaluate interference risks before a broader rollout, and the pilot idea received some support from carriers in their comments. A final proposal would be put to a vote of commissioners at the Republican-majority FCC.</div>

            <div id="article-text">After making the obviously poor decision to kill its XPS laptops and desktops in January 2025, Dell started selling 16- and 14-inch XPS laptops again today.

“It was obvious we needed to change,” Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and COO at Dell Technologies, said at a press event in New York City previewing Dell’s CES 2026 announcements.

A year ago, Dell abandoned XPS branding, as well as its Latitude, Inspiron, and Precision PC lineups. The company replaced the reputable brands with Dell Premium, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Each series included a base model, as well as “Plus” and “Premium.” Dell isn’t resurrecting its Latitude, Inspiron, or Precision series, and it will still sell “Dell Pro” models.

The revival of XPS means the return of one of the easiest recommendations for consumer ultralight laptops. Before last year’s shunning, XPS laptops had a reputation for thin, lightweight designs with modern features and decent performance for the price. This year, Dell is even doing away with some of the design tweaks that it introduced to the XPS lineup in 2022, which, unfortunately, were shoppers’ sole option last year.

Inheriting traits from the XPS 13 Plus introduced in 2022, the XPS-equivalent laptops that Dell released in 2025 had a capacitive-touch row without physical buttons, a borderless touchpad with haptic feedback, and a flat, lattice-free keyboard. The design was meant to enable more thermal headroom but made using the computers feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar.

The XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops launching today have physical function rows. They still have a haptic touchpad, but now the touchpad has comforting left and right borders. And although the XPS 14 and XPS 16 have the same lattice-free keyboard of the XPS 13 Plus, Dell will release a cheaper XPS 13 later this year with a more traditional chiclet keyboard, since those types of keyboards are cheaper to make.

Dell’s about-face comes amid ongoing declines in its consumer PC revenue and global PC market share. It also represents a divergence in Dell’s messaging to computer shoppers.

Last year, Dell, as well as many other computer makers, committed to convincing people that they not only needed to buy a new computer but also a new “AI PC.” Corporate desire to leverage newly mainstream interest in AI to push PC sales was part of the reason Dell made new brand names for its 2025 computers.

“The AI PC market is quickly evolving,” Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, told reporters last year when announcing the new branding. “(E)veryone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity. To make finding the right AI PC easy for customers, we’ve introduced three simple product categories to focus on core customer needs,” he said.

But this week, as Dell unveils its ultralight laptop lineup, AI is taking a backseat.

“We’re getting back to our roots with a renewed focus on consumer and gaming,” Clarke said in a statement accompanying Dell’s announcement today.

The website for the new XPS laptops makes an obligatory nod to Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC program but is primarily focused on the computers’ thin build, low weight, battery life, and display. It seems Dell has accepted that these are the things that the average person cares about in their primary laptop, not the computer’s ability to run AI locally.

The XPS 14 launched today starting at $2,049, and the XPS 16 launched with a starting price of $2,200. A Dell spokesperson told Ars Technica that Dell will release additional configurations in February that are “well under $2,000.” Dell hasn’t shared final specs, pricing, or a release date for the 2026 XPS 13.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/news-orgs-want-openai-to-dig-up-millions-of-deleted-chatgpt-logs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not only does it appear that OpenAI has lost its fight to keep news organizations from digging through 20 million ChatGPT logs to find evidence of copyright infringement—but also OpenAI now faces calls for sanctions and demands to retrieve and share potentially millions of deleted chats long thought of as untouchable in the litigation.

On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein denied objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance the privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.

Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample. That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.

But Stein found that Wang appropriately weighed ChatGPT users’ privacy interests when ordering OpenAI to produce the logs. For example, to shield ChatGPT users, the total number of logs shared was substantially reduced from tens of billions to 20 million, he wrote, and OpenAI has stripped all identifying information from any chats that will be shared.

Stein further agreed that news plaintiffs needed access to the entire sample because, as Wang wrote, even “output logs that do not contain reproductions of News Plaintiffs’ works may still be relevant to OpenAI’s fair use defense.”

Although OpenAI argued that Wang should have approved the “least burdensome” path to users’ privacy, the AI company cited no case law to support that argument, Stein wrote, nor its claims that Wang owed them any explanation for rejecting that path.

“Judge Wang’s failure to explain explicitly why she rejected OpenAI’s search term proposal is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law given that she adequately explained her reasons for ordering production of the entirety of the 20 million de-identified log sample,” Stein wrote, affirming Wang’s order.

OpenAI is currently reviewing if there are any avenues left to fight the order, but it basically looks like the end of the road, after the AI firm vowed to do everything in its power to avoid sharing ordinary users’ conversations.

Asked for comment, OpenAI pointed Ars to a blog documenting its fight, last updated in mid-December. That blog confirmed that all data that will be shared has “undergone a de-identification process intended to remove or mask PII and other private information.” News plaintiffs will be able to search the data but will be unable to copy or print any data not directly relevant to the case, OpenAI said.

News groups, spearheaded by The New York Times, believe that output logs will show evidence of infringing chatbot responses, as well as responses that water down news organizations’ trademarks or remove copyright management information (CMI) to obscure the source and facilitate unlicensed outputs of their content.

They appear beyond frustrated by what their court filings described as delay tactics from OpenAI and co-defendant Microsoft, which has agreed to share 8.1 million Copilot logs but won’t say exactly when those logs will be shared.

Late last year, news organizations asked the court to consider whether sanctions on OpenAI may be warranted.

Allegedly, it took 11 months for news groups to learn that “OpenAI was destroying relevant output log data” by failing to suspend deletion practices as soon as litigation started—including a “quite substantial” fraction of ChatGPT Free, Pro, and Plus output log data. This data, which was allegedly deleted at a “disproportionately higher rate,” is most likely where infringing materials would be found, news groups claimed, as users prompting ChatGPT to skirt paywalls would most likely set chats to delete.

OpenAI provided “no explanation for why it was destroying roughly 1/3 of all user conversation data in the month after [The New York Times] filed suit other than the irrelevant non-sequitur that the ‘number of ChatGPT conversations was uncharacteristically low (shortly before New Year’s Day 2024),’” the filing said.

Describing OpenAI’s alleged “playbook” to dodge copyright claims, news groups accused OpenAI of failing to “take any steps to suspend its routine destruction practices.” There were also “two spikes in mass deletion” that OpenAI attributed to “technical issues.”

However, OpenAI made sure to retain outputs that could help its defense, the court filing alleged, including data from accounts cited in news organizations’ complaints.

OpenAI did not take the same care to preserve chats that could be used as evidence against it, news groups alleged, citing testimony from Mike Trinh, OpenAI’s associate general counsel. “In other words, OpenAI preserved evidence of the News Plaintiffs eliciting their own works from OpenAI’s products but deleted evidence of third-party users doing so,” the filing said.

It’s unclear how much data was deleted, plaintiffs alleged, since OpenAI won’t share “the most basic information” on its deletion practices. But it’s allegedly very clear that OpenAI could have done more to preserve the data, since Microsoft apparently had no trouble doing so with Copilot, the filing said.

News plaintiffs are hoping the court will agree that OpenAI and Microsoft aren’t fighting fair by delaying sharing logs, which they said prevents them from building their strongest case.

They’ve asked the court to order Microsoft to “immediately” produce Copilot logs “in a readily searchable remotely-accessible format,” proposing a deadline of January 9 or “within a day of the Court ruling on this motion.”

Microsoft declined Ars’ request for comment.

And as for OpenAI, it wants to know if the deleted logs, including “mass deletions,” can be retrieved, perhaps bringing millions more ChatGPT conversations into the litigation that users likely expected would never see the light of day again.

On top of possible sanctions, news plaintiffs asked the court to keep in place a preservation order blocking OpenAI from permanently deleting users’ temporary and deleted chats. They also want the court to order OpenAI to explain “the full scope of destroyed output log data for all of its products at issue” in the litigation and whether those deleted chats can be restored, so that news plaintiffs can examine them as evidence, too.</div>

            <h2>Appeals court agrees that Congress blocked cuts to research costs</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/appeals-court-upholds-block-on-one-of-trumps-cuts-to-research-funds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the first signs of what would become an ongoing attack on scientific research came when the Trump administration ordered the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to radically reduce research funding for universities. These funds, termed indirect costs, are awarded when researchers at an institution receive a grant. They cover costs that aren’t directly associated with the research project, such as utilities, facilities for research animals, and building maintenance.

Previously, these costs had been the subject of negotiations and audits, with indirect cost rates for universities in more expensive locations exceeding half the value of the portion of the grant that goes to the researcher. The Trump administration wanted to cut this to a flat rate of 15 percent for everyone, which would be crippling for many universities.

A number of states, later joined by organizations representing a broad array of universities and medical schools, immediately sued to block the policy change. A district court temporarily blocked the new policy from being implemented and later issued a permanent injunction. The government appealed that decision, but on Monday, an appeals court rejected the effort because the first Trump administration had attempted the same move before—and Congress passed a rule to block it. Indirect research funding will remain intact unless the Supreme Court intervenes.

Universities rely on indirect costs to cover everything from building and maintaining dedicated lab space to paying the staff who pick up trash and dispose of hazardous waste. Their costs vary from location to location; universities in dense urban areas, for example, have to pay more for buildings and pay their staff higher salaries. So the NIH has created a formula for universities to estimate their research costs, which serves as the starting point for negotiations. Once the rate is set, audits can be conducted at any time to ensure that the actual costs are consistent with the rate and that funds are spent appropriately.

While indirect rates (the money paid for indirects as a percentage of the money that goes directly to the researcher to support their work) average about 30 percent, many universities have ended up with indirect cost rates above 50 percent. A sudden and unexpected drop to the 15 percent applied retroactively, as planned by the Trump administration, would create serious financial problems for major research universities.

The district court’s initial ruling held that this change was legally problematic in several ways. It violated the Administrative Procedures Act by being issued without any notice or comment, and the low flat rate was found to be arbitrary and capricious, especially compared to the system it was replacing. The ruling determined that the new policy also violated existing procedures within the Department of Health and Human Services.

But the Appeals Court panel of three judges unanimously determined that they didn’t even have to consider all of those issues because Congress had already prohibited exactly this action. In 2017, the first Trump administration also attempted to set all indirect costs to the same low, flat fee, and Congress responded by attaching a rider to a budget agreement that blocked alterations to the NIH overhead policy. Congress has been renewing that rider ever since.

In arguing for its new policy, the government tried to present it as consistent with Congress’s prohibition. The rider allowed some exceptions to the normal means of calculating overhead rates, but they were extremely limited; the NIH tried to argue that these exceptions could include every single grant issued to a university, something the court found was clearly inconsistent with the limits set by Congress.

The court also noted that, as announced, the NIH policy applied to every single grant, regardless of whether the recipient was at a university—something it later contended was a result of “inartful language.” But the judges wrote that it’s a bit late to revise the policy, saying, “We cannot, of course, disregard what the Supplemental Guidance actually says in favor of what NIH now wishes it said.”

Finally, the judges noted that Congress passed the rider specifically to prevent what the Trump administration was trying to do, writing, “The appropriations rider was a direct response to the first Trump administration’s proposal to impose a uniform 10 percent indirect cost reimbursement rate.” Even if the language in the rider wasn’t clear (and the court found it more than clear enough), the legislative history provides a good indication of how the text should be interpreted.

If the administration wants to pursue this policy, it’s left with very few options. One would be to work with Congress to ditch the rider, but Congress is in the process of reversing the cuts to science that the administration had called for, so that’s unlikely to work out. Given how decisive this ruling is, asking the full appeals court to reconsider is also unlikely to go well. That leaves one option: appeal to the Supreme Court, which has generally worked out well for the administration.

The judges here seem to have been considering that potential outcome. There’s an obvious and recent Supreme Court precedent regarding whether courts can intervene in research funding policy. It was an awkward split decision that nobody on the Supreme Court seems to have been happy with, but the appeals court treats it as setting a clear and reasonable standard and spends a fair bit of text explaining how the court’s decision is consistent with it. So to some extent, this decision seems written with an eye toward potential Supreme Court review.

Overall, the decision is a clear win for research universities, with the threat of these funding cuts seeming increasingly remote. There are plenty of other ways that scientific funding is under threat, but for now, Congress and the courts seem to have blocked this one.</div>

            <div id="article-text">“Men do not make laws,” goes a maxim attributed to US president Calvin Coolidge. “They do but discover them.”

If that’s true, then the US attack on Venezuela just uncovered a legislative mother lode. A new law proposed by New York representative Ritchie Torres on Monday would make it illegal for government employees with access to nonpublic information from trading on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

If that sounds like something that should probably already be illegal, Coolidge might agree, in his own laissez-faire way.

“Laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority,” he concluded. “They must rest on the eternal foundation of righteousness.”

In any case, the “Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026,” would include new restrictions on elected officials, political appointees, and executive branch staffers, according to Forbes. It would also apply to government employees who have not yet been privy to nonpublic documents, but “may reasonably obtain such material nonpublic information in the course of performing official duties.”

The proposed legislation comes on the heels of compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the recent kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro placed a series of large bets on Polymarket on whether an attack would take place. Just two days before the surprise attack, the account in question invested over $30,000 in a prediction that either Maduro would be “out” or that US troops would set foot “in Venezuela by” January 31st.

The payout was staggering: a profit of $400,000 in less than 24 hours, as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano estimated.

“Seems pretty suspicious!” Pompliano wrote. “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

Beyond the Venezuela attack, prediction markets have raised serious anxiety about geopolitical strife around the world. Recent advances in the sector have made it so that crypto bros can gamble on deadly conflicts in real-time, betting thousands of dollars on questions like “will Russia capture all of Kupiansk by March 31?”

Back in October, Reuters reported that the Trump Media and Technology Group was working with Crypto.com to implement prediction market functionality into Truth Social. That came as dozens of federal investigations into crypto-based price fixing, securities fraud, and regulatory noncompliance have been dropped at the Trump administration’s urging. Two of those cases were against prediction platforms Polymarket —the very same implicated in the Venezuela allegations — and Kalshi, for selling options contracts related to congressional elections.

Whether Torres’ new bill makes it very far remains to be seen. Recent history shows that Congress has little appetite for regulation of insider trading — and for now, there doesn’t yet seem to be a wager on the outcome of the bill on either Polymarket or Kalshi.

            <div id="article-text">Grok, the flagship chatbot created by the Elon Musk-founded AI venture xAI and infused into X-formerly-Twitter — a platform also owned by Elon Musk — continues to be used by trollish misogynists, pedophiles, and other freaks of the digital gutters to non-consensually undress images of women and, even more horrifyingly, underage girls.

The women and girls targeted in these images range from celebrities and public figures to many non-famous private citizens who are often just average web users. As Futurism reported, some of the AI images generated by Grok and automatically published to X were specifically altered to depict real women in violent scenarios, including scenes of sexual abuse, humiliation, physical injury, kidnapping and insinuated murder.

Because Grok is integrated into X, this growing pile of nonconsensual and seemingly illegal images are automatically published directly to the social media platform — and thus are disseminated to the open web, in plain view, visible to pretty much anyone. As it stands, X and xAI have yet to take any meaningful action to stem the tide.

Below is a timeline of how this story has so far unfolded, and which we’ll continue to update as we follow whether X and xAI take action against this flood of harmful content.

A normal company, upon realizing that its platform-embedded AI chatbot was being used at scale to CSAM and unwanted deepfake porn of real people and spew it into the open web, would likely move quickly to disconnect the chatbot from its platform until a problem of such scale and severity could be resolved. But these days, X is not a normal company, and Grok is the same chatbot infamous for scandals including — but not limited to — calling itself “MechaHitler” and spouting antisemitic bile.

The story here isn’t just that Grok was doing this in the first place. It’s also that X, as a platform, appears to be a safe haven for the mass-generation of CSAM and nonconsensual sexual imagery of real women — content that has largely been treated by the losers creating this stuff like it’s all just one big meme. We’ll continue to follow whether X makes meaningful changes — or if it continues to choose inaction.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a blunder that sums up Tesla’s struggling efforts in the self-driving space, Electrek reports that the Elon Musk-owned automaker has badly screwed up trying to get a trademark for its upcoming “Cybercab.”

The Cybercab, for the uninformed, is Tesla’s purpose-built vehicle for giving driverless rides. Right now, its capital-R Robotaxi service, which operates as a comically tiny fleet exclusively in Austin, Texas, uses existing Tesla Model Ys, not specialized cars (and its trademark is itself under peril due to yet more incompetence, as we’ll explain later.) A prototype of the two-passenger, no-steering wheel Cybercab was unveiled at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event over a year ago, and Musk claims it’ll enter production in Q2 this year.

That promise could still end up being fulfilled, if you’re to ignore Musk’s proclivity for making overblown statements. But in the meantime, the fabled Cybercab is in serious danger of losing its name.

According to a US Patent and Trademark Office suspension notice obtained by Electrek, the trademark “Cybercab” has been formally suspended as of November 14, 2025, for two main reasons: a “likelihood of confusion,” the USPTO’s examining attorney wrote, and because another company called Unibev, a French beverage outfit, beat Tesla to the punch.

This wasn’t down to bad luck. Per the reporting, Musk unveiled the Cybercab at the “We, Robot” event on October 10, 2024, but neglected to file an application until November — an astonishing oversight for a company so large and ambitious. Unibev, meanwhile, saw the opening and filed a “Cybercab” application before the end of the month. Tesla had weeks to secure its trademark, even after making the questionable decision of not filing for it before unveiling the new product at a highly covered event.

Unibev is using a tactic called trademark squatting, and it apparently has a vendetta with Tesla, having three trademarks for “TESLAQUILA” in the US, the same name Tesla tried to use for its own line of tequila, Electrek noted.

As we alluded to earlier, this isn’t the only branding blow Tesla has suffered for its self-driving cab efforts. Last summer, the USPTO turned down Tesla’s application for trademarking the term “Robotaxi” for being too generic. Or in the examiner’s words, “merely descriptive,” since the term robotaxi is “used to describe similar goods and services by other companies.” It may as well have tried to trademark its cars as Cars.

With the Cybercab blunder, Tesla has already tried and failed to change the USPTO’s mind, so it looks like it’ll have to cut a deal with Unibev to drop its claim, or argue in court that it can’t hold the trademark since it has no intent to build cars. An Electrek source familiar with the matter says that Tesla and Unibev are in negotiations, but with no agreement reached yet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If machines ever fight a war against humans, it’ll probably be fought with modern weapons of war — bullets, bombs, and perhaps plasma weapons a la “The Terminator” — in a conflict, the robots will presumably dominate against us sacks of flesh and blood. Heck, the AI could even just bioengineer a virus to wipe us out.

And even if the battlefield were somehow constrained to kicks and fists, we’re increasingly sure that humankind would catch an epic beatdown as humanoid robots show ever-greater advances in dexterity and martial arts acumen.

A new video shared by Chinese industry titan Unitree, for instance, shows off a new six-foot-tall H2 humanoid robot that’s capable of pulling off some seriously impressive moves. The lanky bot can be seen performing an impressive air kick while coming eerily close to the head of a human engineer standing nearby, destroying watermelons hung up above its head height with a mighty foot, and even sending two heavy punching bags spinning after delivering yet another powerful blow.

Unitree’s $30,000, 180cm (nearly 6 ft tall) H2 humanoid robot. This version is likely powered by an Nvidia Jetson AGX Thor platform, built on Blackwell architecture. pic.twitter.com/E3tTHUjRGw

In other words, if the fate of humanity were to be decided in the dojo via mixed martial arts, we’re not even sure humankind’s entire stable of UFC fighters could save us.

While Unitree’s latest demonstration of its H2 robot, a follow-up to its hugely popular and much shorter G1, is certainly impressive, it raises an interesting question. Why is the firm — and seemingly the vast majority of its competitors — so focused on martial arts? Just last month, Chinese company EngineAI posted a video of its CEO being kicked in the stomach by its perhaps appropriately-named T800 humanoid robote.

Whatever happened to far more useful applications for humanoid robotics, like cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, or assisting the elderly?

Sure, H2 can spin on its own axis midair and turn a watermelon into pulp in one swift fusillade — but can it pick up a dirty sock off the ground?

Hell, if Unitree and its contemporaries are looking to impress us with their robots’ lethal prowess, why not attach some weapons to their extremities? Why go through the trouble of teaching them how to roundhouse kick?

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the viability of humanoid robots and their future role in society, despite billions of dollars being poured into their development. They may excel at pulling off pre-programmed martial arts moves, but the devil is in the details.

Manipulating objects and adjusting to the constantly changing conditions of the real world are proving far more challenging, further distancing us from a future in which humanoid robots are there to help us in our everyday lives, let alone become affordable enough for the average consumer.

And if they were to turn against us, they’d likely need to pick up a lot more skills than slick punches and kicks to wipe us off the planet for good.

Besides — as perfectly illustrated in a recent viral video that appears to show a man who’s remotely controlling a G1 humanoid robot to essentially kick himself in the nuts with the bot — chances are, humanity will have no problem defeating itself.

            <h2>Scientists Discover Impossible Object in Deep Space</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/impossible-hot-galaxy-cluster-big-bang">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While peering into some of the oldest regions of the known universe — dating back to just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang — an international team of astronomers made a puzzling discovery.

As detailed in a paper published the journal Nature, they discovered an extremely hot galaxy cluster that’s far hotter and older than current theories allow.

In other words, the discovered cluster is, under our current best understanding of cosmology, impossible — which could upend our current understanding of how the early universe evolved.

“We didn’t expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,” said lead author and University of British Columbia PhD candidate Dazhi Zhou in a statement about the finding.

“In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real,” he added. “But after months of verification, we’ve confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.”

The astronomers’ best theory is that the cluster somehow got a massive head start — previously unimaginable even to top thinkers — thanks to black holes lurking at its core.

“This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster,” added coauthor and Dalhousie University professor Scott Chapman, “much earlier and more strongly than we thought.”

Conventional theories suggest that galaxy clusters gain energy as the gases inside are pulled together and squeezed due to intensifying gravitational forces. The latest research, however, suggests there’s more to how these clusters evolve — perhaps even a separate source beyond these gravitational forces.

The team found the strange readings when they analyzed observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile that examined a “baby” galaxy cluster called SPT2349-56.

The cluster, which dates back to around 12 billion years, is huge: its core alone measures around half a million light-years across. That’s roughly the size of the halo that circles our own Milky Way galaxy, a vast region that contains globular clusters and older stars — yet it spawns stars more than 5,000 times faster.

The astronomers are hoping to figure out what allowed it to get so incredibly hot, a source of energy that defies our current models. The research suggests galaxy clusters evolve in a far more explosive manner than previously thought, aided by gravitational interactions between multiple supermassive black holes.

“We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,” Zhou explained in the statement. “How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?”

“Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,” Chapman said. “These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.”

            <div id="article-text">AI’s use in the legal sphere is the gift that keeps on giving.

This time, it’s the sobering sense of disappointment that set in after a team building an AI chatbot for Alaska’s court system actually tested it and found out it was a hallucinating disaster, NBC News reports.

The chatbot, dubbed the Alaska Virtual Assistant, was designed to help people handle forms and other procedures involved in probate, the legal process of transferring a person’s belongings after their death.

In a predictable turn of events, instead of streamlining an already headache-inducing process inflicted on people who are probably mourning the loss of a loved one, the AI bungled simple questions and left most users feeling annoyed rather than supported.

Exhibiting a failing inherent to all large language models, the esteemed virtual assistant kept hallucinating, or making up facts and sharing exaggerated information, according to the people involved in its development.

“We had trouble with hallucinations, regardless of the model, where the chatbot was not supposed to actually use anything outside of its knowledge base,” Aubrie Souza, a consultant with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC), told NBC News. “For example, when we asked it, ‘Where do I get legal help?’ it would tell you, ‘There’s a law school in Alaska, and so look at the alumni network.’ But there is no law school in Alaska.”

And rather than finding it helpful, most people who tested it found it incredibly grating. The bot, unsurprisingly, suffered from the same character flaw plaguing most chatbots: being too sycophantic and cloying, feigning empathy and plying you with pleasantries instead of just getting down to business.

“Through our user testing, everyone said, ‘I’m tired of everybody in my life telling me that they’re sorry for my loss,” Souza said. “So we basically removed those kinds of condolences, because from an AI chatbot, you don’t need one more.”

Built in collaboration with Tom Martin, a lawyer who runs an a company called LawDroid that makes AI legal tools, the AVA AI has been trapped in development hell for over a year now, when it was “supposed to be a three-month project,” according to Souza. After lowering their expectations — and assuredly ironing out its horrendous flaws — AVA’s team says it’s finally ready for a public launch in late January.

“We did shift our goals on this project a little bit,” Stacey Marz, administrative director of the Alaska Court System and an AVA project leader, told NBC News. “We wanted to replicate what our human facilitators at the self-help center are able to share with people. But we’re not confident that the bots can work in that fashion, because of the issues with some inaccuracies and some incompleteness.”

“It was just so very labor-intensive to do this,” Marz added, despite “all the buzz about generative AI, and everybody saying this is going to revolutionize self-help and democratize access to the courts.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is in full swing in Las Vegas, with the show floor open to the public after a packed couple of days occupied by press conferences from the likes of Nvidia, Sony, and AMD and previews from Sunday’s Unveiled event.

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our Senior AI Editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage. Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with the debut sets both having a Star Wars theme. Senior Writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

Morgan Little is TechCrunch’s Director of Audience Development, having joined the team in 2023. He helps steer the site’s efforts across social media, SEO, newsletters and external partners, and is based in San Francisco.

In prior roles, Morgan led the audience teams for sites like CNET and GameSpot, juggled social media and political reporting for the Los Angeles Times and had a stint at marketing agencies that has given him a fear of timesheets.

He’s worked within the space long enough to have professionally run a Tumblr account, and still has Peach downloaded on his phone.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week in Las Vegas, tech companies at CES 2026 are unveiling the latest wearable health devices — glucose monitors, blood pressure trackers, fitness trackers. Probably not mentioned at the show is that these gadgets might be creating a massive environmental problem.

It isn’t something that tends to get much attention, but a new study from Cornell University and the University of Chicago found that by 2050, demand for health wearables could hit 2 billion units per year, or 42 times more than today. Unless we change how they’re made, these devices could generate over a million tons of electronic waste and 100 million tons of carbon dioxide over that same period, the authors warn.

An even bigger surprise is that it’s not the plastic that’s the problem. The study, published in Nature, found that the printed circuit board — the device’s “brain” — accounts for 70% of its carbon footprint, largely due to intensive mining and manufacturing.

The researchers suggest two fixes: develop chips using common metals like copper instead of rare minerals like gold, and make devices modular so the circuit board can be reused while the outer covering gets replaced.

Wrote one of the study’s co-authors, “When these devices are deployed at global scale, small design choices add up quickly.” It’s something to think about while scrolling through CES announcements.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/a-viral-reddit-post-alleging-fraud-from-a-food-delivery-app-turned-out-to-be-ai-generated/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Reddit user claiming to be a whistleblower from a food delivery app has been outed as a fake. The user wrote a viral post alleging that the company he worked for was exploiting its drivers and users.

“You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories,” the supposed whistleblower wrote.

He claimed to be drunk and at the library to use its public Wi-Fi, where he was typing this long screed about how the company was exploiting legal loopholes to steal drivers’ tips and wages with impunity.

Those claims were, unfortunately, believable — DoorDash actually was sued for stealing tips from drivers, resulting in a $16.75 million settlement. But in this case, the poster had made up his story.

People lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got another 208,000 likes and 36.8 million impressions.

Casey Newton, the journalist behind Platformer, wrote that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal. The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an 18-page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.

“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?”

There have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor.

Generative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.

Max Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.

“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”

Tools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.

Case in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else. Yes — there was more than one “viral AI food delivery hoax on Reddit this weekend.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/mobileye-acquires-humanoid-robot-startup-mentee-robotics-for-900m/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mobileye made its name, and money, by supplying automakers with millions of computer vision chips designed to support automotive safety features and advanced driver assistance systems. The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software.

Now, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.

The Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup co-founded by Shashua in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder, and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company.

The transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.

“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”

Mentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap.

The benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world.

In other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023.

Of course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute.

The acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems.

            <div id="article-text">xAI, Elon Musk’s AI company behind the Grok chatbot — it also owns X — announced that it has raised $20 billion in a Series E funding round.

The company wrote in a blog post that investors will include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, and others, including Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.” xAI has not disclosed if these investments come in the form of equity or debt.

xAI says it has about 600 million monthly active users of X and Grok, and it will use this new funding to continue expanding its data centers and Grok models.

However, as xAI grows, so does its capacity for harm. This past weekend, X users asked Grok to create sexualized deepfakes of real people — including children. Instead of refusing these requests or activating any sort of guardrail, Grok complied, effectively generating child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other nonconsensual sexual content of real people.

xAI is now under investigation by international authorities in the European Union, the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, and France.

            <h2>California lawmaker proposes a four-year ban on AI chatbots in kids’ toys</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/california-lawmaker-proposes-a-four-year-ban-on-ai-chatbots-in-kids-toys/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Senator Steve Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Monday that would place a four-year ban on the sale and manufacture of toys with AI chatbot capabilities for kids under 18. The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”

“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”

The bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.

Over the past year, lawsuits filed by families whose children died by suicide after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently passed SB 243, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.

While the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group PIRG Education Fund warned that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. NBC News found that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.

OpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an “AI-powered product” in 2025, but delayed their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026.

“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said.

When U.S. Delta Force commandos slipped into Venezuelan airspace over the weekend, they did so in secrecy. And yet, in the hours before President Donald Trump gave the final order for the strike, someone bet more than $20,000 that Nicolás Maduro would be ousted as the country’s leader by the end of January.

On Polymarket, the online platform that lets people wager on almost anything, an anonymous trader somewhere in the world placed a series of suspiciously well-timed bets. Using a fresh account created last month, the individual made just a few bets in the days leading up to the raid, according to The Wall Street Journal—all on the possibility of imminent regime change in Venezuela—and appeared to come away with more than $400,000.

Listen: Prediction markets and the ‘suckerifcation’ crisis, with Max Read

Perhaps the bettor just got phenomenally lucky. Or perhaps they knew about the raid ahead of time and leveraged it for a quick payout. We can’t know, because Polymarket, a so-called prediction market where people turn their idle hunches into real cash, allows some of its customers to remain anonymous. Traders place their bets using crypto, which could provide another layer of cover. The Maduro trade has generated a huge amount of speculation and controversy; the internet is now full of jokes that Barron Trump, hunched behind dual monitors in his NYU dorm room, may have been behind it.

This is not the first instance of a well-timed bet on Polymarket raising questions about insider trading. Just before María Corina Machado, a leader of Venezuela’s opposition to Maduro, was declared the winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, the probability that she would win the award began to spike on Polymarket (despite a highly secretive selection process). The Nobel Institute has said that it may have been a victim of espionage. Early last month, a trader made a series of bets related to Google’s most popular searches of 2025. Just before the company released its “Year in Search” report, the user bet on some of those top searches with uncanny accuracy. In the end, the account netted more than $1 million.

Traditional financial markets have clear-cut rules around insider trading: Capitalizing on nonpublic information is plainly illegal. Polymarket seems to have no such policies in its terms of use (although it does ban activity that violates “applicable laws”). The company’s CEO, Shayne Coplan, has also explicitly said that Polymarket creates a “financial incentive for people to go and divulge” new information. The thinking is that, if the function of these tools is to predict the future, then rewarding people for leaking information could be seen as a positive. When insiders push markets toward what’s actually going to happen, they can hypothetically turn prediction markets into a source of real-time unfiltered news. There are legal ways to find and divulge new information—say, in scraping publicly available data for an edge over other traders—but Coplan did not draw that distinction. (Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment.)

Not all prediction markets share this ethos. Kalshi, Polymarket’s biggest competitor, “explicitly prohibits insider trading of any form,” a spokesperson told me over email. But the concept of treating insider trading as a feature rather than a bug seems to be gaining traction. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase—a cryptocurrency exchange that recently purchased a prediction-market firm—laid out this line of thinking at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit last month: “If your goal is actually for the 99 percent of people trying to get signal about what’s going to happen in the world—like, ‘Is the Suez Canal going to be reopened?’ or whatever—you actually want insider trading.”

Outsourcing privileged information to prediction markets in the name of “news” has some clear problems. Maduro’s ouster is a helpful example: Both the Times and The Washington Post reportedly learned of the plans for Saturday’s raid before it happened, and held off on publishing their stories to avoid endangering U.S. troops. No such editorial-judgment calls are being made across betting markets. The democratization of certain kinds of information can be a social good—but not like this.

As it becomes easier for people to bet on everyday phenomena, more opportunities will open up for insiders to leverage private information for fast cash. Hypothetically, the Deloitte employees who tabulate Grammy votes can bet on who might win Song of the Year, and the White House aide with a sense of the president’s mood can bet on whether he’ll publicly use the word fuck before the end of the month. It’s no secret that these markets can be gamed. Armstrong closed Coinbase’s most recent earnings call with a string of non sequiturs (“Bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, staking, and Web3”) in a nod to the traders betting on whether those specific words would crop up during the call.

Polymarket has become enormously popular, even though its main platform isn’t meant to be accessed from within the United States. In 2022, the company shut down its domestic service as part of a settlement with the Biden administration over alleged regulatory violations. Still, American bettors have found an easy work-around in the digital trickery of VPNs, or virtual private networks. Polymarket is now gearing up for a U.S. comeback, with the support of the new White House. The company tapped a former Trump campaign manager to lobby on its behalf last year, and Donald Trump Jr. now serves as an adviser to both Polymarket and Kalshi. The Trump family’s media company is working on a prediction market too: Truth Predict.

Insider trading is frowned upon because it further slants an already uneven playing field, further enriching those in proximity to the biggest and most consequential decisions of the day and leaving the public at a disadvantage. This, at least, has been the prevailing view for much of the modern history of American commerce. Traditional financial markets aren’t always fair, but they at least purport to operate from a shared perspective. Among the central innovations of prediction markets is the idea that an unequal playing field might actually facilitate the truth. It’s a convenient line. But it obscures the fact that these are still very much also just markets. When insiders win, the rest of us lose.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This weekend’s attack on Venezuela produced plenty of indelible images. The one burned into my brain was shared by President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is sitting in front of a laptop at a makeshift command center in Mar-a-Lago. He’s monitoring the raid with a grave expression on his face, eyes intently focused on something out of frame.

At first glance, the image has all the trappings of a Serious Tactical Raid Photo, à la Pete Souza’s famous Situation Room snapshot, which showed President Barack Obama and his national-security team tracking the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound. But then you see what’s behind Hegseth: a large screen displaying an X feed. The photo is blurry, but it seems to show Hegseth and company using X’s search function to monitor tweets about the raid. On the screen, hovering over Hegseth’s left shoulder, is a giant face-holding-back-tears emoji (🥹).

The photo quickly spread around the internet on Saturday—mostly as a way to mock just how terminally online the Trump administration appears to be. “They monitor the situation just like how we do,” one person who works in crypto wrote on X. On Bluesky, I watched others make fun of Hegseth, Trump, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as part of a “podcaster-occupied government.”

It is no secret that the Trump administration is social media–addled. Over the past year, most of the government’s major online accounts—especially on X—have become megaphones for cruel and racist shitposting, not unlike what one might see from a garden-variety troll on 4chan. These accounts have shared deportation ASMR; an AI-generated, Studio Ghiblified version of a real photo of a crying woman being arrested by ICE; a post comparing immigrants to the alien vermin in the Halo video-game series; and Nazi-coded “Defend the fatherland” memes. And who could forget the AI-slop video of Trump in a fighter jet dropping what appeared to be human feces on protesters in Times Square. These official government communications are a key part of how the Trump administration does its job. It is governance through content creation.

This is why the Trump administration is staffed with former reality-show stars, cable-news hosts, and popular podcasters. It is why the government allows friendly camera crews to accompany ICE raids, why former Congressman Matt Gaetz is given a Pentagon press credential along with Laura Loomer, and why Vice President J. D. Vance spends his days trolling people on X. It’s why Kristi Noem staged a photo op in front of a cage full of men at El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, and why the administration has allowed YouTubers to make videos there. It’s why an assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice is on X, grousing about her follower count stalling at a paltry 1.3 million and asking, “What kind of content do my folks want to see more of to like and share?” And it’s the reason that Katie Miller—who left the Trump administration to work for Elon Musk and then left Musk to start a podcast—posted a photo on X on Saturday showing a map of Greenland colored as an American flag with the caption “SOON.” The U.S. government is concerned first and foremost with spectacle, engaging in both fan service for its most extreme supporters and the constant trolling of its enemies. The goal, above all else, is to elicit a response.

The Hegseth photo from Saturday and others like it confirm this dynamic. Why would the men in charge of the most powerful military and intelligence services in the world be monitoring a popular X account called “OSINTdefender” if they weren’t performing for an online audience? (The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.) Perhaps one could defend their scrolling as potentially useful data gathering on the grounds that, during the bin Laden raid, early tweets from local citizens began to break the news well before the mainstream media caught on. But such posts are low-level intelligence, a kind that is arguably far too trivial for a Cabinet secretary or president to pay attention to. The simplest explanation is that everyone in that room at Mar-a-Lago wanted to observe the spectacle created by their actions.

“I watched it literally like I was watching a television show,” Trump said in a phone interview Saturday with Fox News. “It was an amazing thing.” His description suggests military invasion as personal entertainment—a reality show with stark geopolitical consequences that the president can produce and direct via his whims.

Trump is obsessed with ratings, and social media provides ample opportunities to watch numbers go up at the same time as other politicians, media members, and onlookers respond. And so you get not only an invasion and a press conference but a slew of posts. In the first day after Nicolás Maduro was seized, Trump or official government accounts had shared:

The more I watched the fallout from the invasion play out online, the more futile any effort to make sense of it felt. I felt like I was trapped in a recursive loop of a very specific style of internet content: the reaction video.

Reaction videos began on YouTube in the mid-2000s, and they are now a hallmark of online content. As the name suggests, they show people responding to other media. In the early days, these were typically gross-out videos like the infamous “2 Girls, 1 Cup,” and as The New York Times’ Sam Anderson wrote back in 2011, their appeal was allowing “people to watch this taboo thing by proxy, to experience its dangerous thrill without having to encounter it directly.”

Over time, reaction videos became far more interesting and varied—a way to experience something vicariously for the first time or to share the joy of something you love with others. As Anderson noted, the videos are best at capturing surprise: “that moment when the world breaks, when it violates or exceeds its basic duties and forces someone to undergo some kind of dramatic shift.”

Today, the world feels like it’s breaking in any number of ways—so perhaps it makes sense that the logic and structure of the reaction video pervades media, culture, and politics. Some of this feeling has to do with the structure of social media, where timelines are no longer sorted chronologically but algorithmically, feeding users a steady stream of content that’s likely to elicit a strong reaction. The algorithmic internet has always been chaotic, but as the platforms have matured and evolved, the culture they produce and behaviors they provoke have become insular and inscrutable—at least to people who don’t spend huge chunks of time online. Especially on X, algorithmic culture is characterized by ceaseless iteration: Everything that’s happening is piled atop all the things that just happened.

When any given event occurs—a raid in Venezuela, say—the trolls, pundits, know-it-alls, and shitposters flood in immediately. Discourse is a gameable phenomenon now; people know how to play their roles by heart. These days, one doesn’t experience the news on these platforms before seeing the memes and reactions—the reaction and the news are, in essence, one thing now.

By the time I saw the news of the raid, a photo Trump had posted showing a blindfolded Maduro in a Nike sweatsuit had already become a meme. Just a few minutes later, that meme had mixed with a dozen others. In a few hours, I stumbled upon a split-screen generative-AI slop video of Maduro DJing in the sweatsuit in one frame while, in the other, Trump’s face was superimposed onto a clip of Jon Hamm blissed out and dancing in a club. An image of Maduro in handcuffs wearing a blue sweatshirt and giving a thumbs-up was followed immediately by a marketing meme posted by that sweatshirt’s manufacturer; scroll more and there’s the same photo, now with Maduro’s face replaced by Charlie Kirk’s.

The result is essentially insane and postliterate. But it is also pretty much legible for those steeped in online culture. It is coherent incoherence, everything reacting to everything else, all at once. The same thing happened after Kirk was shot. The memes, commentary, and speculation became a culture unto itself, a loop of ironic posting, information warring, and commentary on commentary—all before his shooter was identified or Kirk was even pronounced dead. This process is nihilistic, and it has a dehumanizing effect. Stories about people or countries in conflict become abstract, buried under a pile of memes and recursive references that exist for little more than scroll-by entertainment. Over the past decade, online performance for others has evolved out of popular culture and media and become a primary means of communication for everyone—mass shooters, meme makers, and POTUS all included.

Trump has been rightfully called the Twitter president in the past, and a crucial part of that legacy is the skilled exploitation of this information environment. His administration’s chief output is online shitposting. It’s not an actual form of governance, nor is it a kind of policy, but it is performative speech that’s supposed to signify action and, in the case of the Venezuela raid, strength. The resources of the most powerful military in the world are being marshaled in service of making memes declaring, “THIS IS OUR HEMISPHERE.” All because the country’s leaders think it’s good theater, and in a postliterate political era, the spectacle is propulsive. It gives so many of the entities of our media, political, and cultural ecosystems what they crave: something to react to.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nicolás Maduro wasn’t due to arrive at his arraignment yesterday in downtown Manhattan until noon, but a large crowd had already formed outside the federal courthouse by 9 a.m. Actually, two crowds. One had come to tell Donald Trump to keep his hands off Venezuela. The other, which seemed largely Venezuelan, had come to celebrate.

Maduro was, until Saturday, a widely hated ruler. His last election campaign consisted of threatening his people with a “bloodbath” if he lost. (Even so, he lost, but he claimed victory anyway.) The two crowds outside the courthouse mirrored the split reaction following Maduro’s capture by the United States. For many international observers, his ouster was cause for alarm—a sign that a U.S. president can drop bombs abroad and overthrow a foreign leader without a declaration of war or congressional approval. But for so many Venezuelans, the sight of Maduro in shackles was about a tyrant facing justice.

Before the hearing began, the hallway outside the courtroom was packed with people hoping to get a seat. Some were law students who had come because they sensed that a legal precedent was being set, though not necessarily a good one. The way Maduro was captured “puts the system of international law in danger,” Leo Enderle, a German student at NYU, told me. Another group of people had come for the sheer spectacle. The man standing in front of me said he had attended the arraignments of Sean Combs and Donald Trump in the same building; according to him, this crowd was just as big. When I arrived, he was outraged that a Venezuelan man had cut in line to join a friend. The Venezuelan explained that he had been a political prisoner for years and had dreamed of this moment. Just because you were a political prisoner, the man in front of me was lamenting, doesn’t mean you get to cut the line.

But by far the largest group of attendees I spoke with were Venezuelans who wanted to see Maduro punished. The last time I had stood in line with so many Venezuelans angry at Maduro was in 2013, when I still lived in the country, in one of the infamous breadlines that resulted from rationing. Then, like now, people were very talkative. At the courthouse, an elegantly dressed woman from Caracas told me she had left her newborn granddaughter at home with a nanny. “This historical moment, I couldn’t miss it!”

David Cardenas, a Venezuelan opposition activist, told me that Maduro had singled him out on TV one day, threatening to send police to his house and jail him as part of “Operation Knock-Knock.” Soon after, Cardenas, who lives in the United States, posted a video saying Maduro would be the target of Operation Trump-Trump. “I guess Trump-Trump came before Knock-Knock,” Cardenas told me with a smile.

Elsewhere in line, a young woman I’ll call Maria had come to the courthouse with her mother, who was visiting from Venezuela for the holidays. (She asked me to withhold her name for privacy concerns.) Maria told me that nobody she knew in America could understand why she was excited to see Maduro arrested: “My friends are like, ‘This is imperialism!’ and ‘So sorry Trump did this to your country!’” When one of her housemates told her they were thinking of going to protest Maduro’s capture, Maria responded that not every prisoner deserves sympathy.

After we were seated in the courtroom, Maduro walked in, escorted by guards. Instead of his usual button-down, he wore a navy-blue T-shirt, with an orange one peeking out from underneath. Maduro scanned the audience as though he were looking for a friendly face, but he didn’t seem to find one. “Buenos días,” he said to no one in particular, and sat down.

Read: The biggest question about Venezuela

“Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked.

Maduro responded in Spanish, as he would throughout the hearing. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros, the constitutional president of Venezuela,” he said, and went on to explain that he’d been kidnapped by the United States. He called himself a “prisoner of war.” Visibly impatient, the judge suggested that Maduro should respond with a simple yes or no. “Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked again. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros,” he responded.

The judge then read the charges aloud: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and two others related to weapons. Maduro pleaded not guilty, adding, “I’m a decent man and still the president of Venezuela.” Once again, the judge told Maduro to keep his answers succinct, before addressing Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, who was sitting nearby wearing the same outfit.

The judge told Maduro that, as a foreigner facing trial in the United States, he had the right to consulate resources. But Maduro himself had effectively closed Venezuela’s consulates when he recalled the country’s diplomats from the United States in 2019, leaving more than half a million people without representation. It’s unclear, then, exactly what resources Maduro will have access to.

As the hearing finished and Maduro stood to leave, spectators jeered at him in Spanish, a liberty that—had they taken it in Venezuela just last week—would probably have landed them in prison, or worse. “Have fun in jail,” one said. “On behalf of all Venezuelans, you will pay,” shouted another. One woman was even more blunt: “Damn you.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">In 1812, Spanish officials in Havana, searching the house of a man named José Antonio Aponte, discovered a wooden box hidden in a clothing trunk, opened it, and were stunned by what they found inside. “It was unlike any book they had ever seen,” Carrie Gibson writes in The Great Resistance: The 400-Year Fight to End Slavery in the Americas, “filled with Biblical and historical images, with many black faces, as well as cut-out bits of paper and handwritten words.” Aponte, a freeman who had once served in the local militia, was part of a group that had sought to launch an uprising among the enslaved. The goal was to overthrow slavery and make Cuba independent, but the rebellion had been quickly suppressed.

Put on trial, Aponte was questioned for three days about what his interrogators called his “book of paintings.” In Daring to Be Free: Rebellion and Resistance of the Enslaved in the Atlantic World, Sudhir Hazareesingh emphasizes the global sweep of Aponte’s portraits, among them versions of Abyssinian royalty and, as Gibson notes, the Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic, believed to have once been a slave himself. One element particularly alarmed the Spanish: scenes of Black soldiers vanquishing white troops, evoking the victories of Haitian revolutionaries against the French a decade earlier. During meetings at his house, Aponte had shown them to fellow insurrectionists as proof that they, too, could win a war against slavery.

When he was asked to explain why he had chosen to include what he did, his answer was simple: “For reasons of history.” Aponte was executed after his trial, and his book disappeared. All that is left are Aponte’s descriptions of the work, page by page, at his trial. But that testimony has allowed contemporary historians and artists to reconstruct his visionary awareness that, in seeking to change his world, he first had to compile his own history of what had come before.

In their ambitious histories of slave resistance, Gibson and Hazareesingh are working in the tradition of Aponte, offering a new intellectual and political perspective on the emergence of freedom in the modern world. A generation ago, foundational works on the history of antislavery movements tended to focus on political thinkers and prominent abolitionists, figures who left ample written records behind. But over the past several decades, scholars have made headway in piecing together the ideas and actions of resistance leaders such as Aponte, as well as of the enslaved themselves. This is challenging work: The system of slavery frequently barred access to literacy, and most accounts of enslaved resistance come from people who were not just hostile to the venture but actively seeking to suppress it. By gathering second- and thirdhand traces and elusive sources and data, historians have illuminated communities in the forests of the Kongo region, the deltas of West Africa, the mangroves of Cuba, and the swamps of the Carolinas.

From the November 2025 issue: The Black loyalists of the American Revolution

The Great Resistance and Daring to Be Free synthesize this growing body of scholarship to offer detailed accounts that stretch from the 15th century, when enslaved people from West Africa were first imported to Iberia, through the abolition of slavery in the United States, Cuba, and Brazil in the late 19th century. Gibson builds on her own earlier wide-ranging history of the Caribbean, Empire’s Crossroads (2014), and Hazareesingh branches out from Black Spartacus (2020), his biography of Toussaint Louverture, a leader of the Haitian Revolution.

The story of resistance begins in Africa, where the slave trade itself originates. There, Hazareesingh argues, lie the foundations of a long and influential tradition of antislavery activity that continued into resistance efforts throughout the Americas. He assembles evidence of what he calls an “African fugitive politics”: people on the continent threatened by enslavement taking concerted action in collective ways, intent on self-determination. In many different regions, groups seeking sanctuary from raids by slavers created new settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many of them exist to this day, their founding histories preserved and celebrated in oral traditions.

The Tofinu took refuge in the lagoons along the Bight of Benin, a core area of the slave trade, venturing forth in canoes with harpoons, javelins, and swords to fight off raiders from powerful nearby kingdoms. In present-day central Nigeria, the Eggon created fortified positions in the hills from which they launched stones, spears, and even beehives against would-be enslavers. The focus on living in freedom nurtured a nonhierarchical approach to politics, Hazareesingh writes, and he describes an ethos rooted in honor and consensus. Settlements were named to convey their fugitive origins. “Here where no one can reach them anymore,” one was called; another was “the village of free people.”

Millions couldn’t escape the raiders on the continent. But the remarkable SlaveVoyages database—which both Gibson and Hazareesingh draw on—has transformed our knowledge of resistance at sea. An open-access digital project, it has documented the scale of the slave trade originating on the continent, compiling data on roughly 35,000 voyages that carried at least 10 million people across the Atlantic from Africa. It has also found references to 465 shipboard revolts. Using the database, one study suggests that open resistance may have occurred in as many as 10 percent of slave voyages. The majority of the revolts date back to well before Joseph Cinqué’s carefully plotted rebellion on the Amistad in 1839, the most famous of them and one of a small number that succeeded in securing freedom for those aboard.

Historians are also indebted to written documents left behind by Islamic and Catholic thinkers in Africa who developed religious critiques of slavery. Both Gibson and Hazareesingh single out a Kongolese man named Lourenço da Silva Mendonça, who in the 17th century articulated a particularly powerful attack. He was born into the Ndongo royal lineage in the Kingdom of Kongo, where many had adopted Catholicism. In 1671, he and his family were forced out of the kingdom by the Portuguese and sent to the colony of Brazil. Having seen the ravages of slave-raiding in his homeland, he now witnessed the system of slavery into which many of his people had been sold. He then traveled to Portugal and took up residence in a monastery where several others from the Kongo, as well as Indigenous Brazilians, lived and studied.

Convinced that slavery went against the teachings of Catholicism, he wrote a brief denouncing the institution, which he brought to the Vatican in 1684. “Humanity is infused with the spirit of God,” he argued, and racial differences, an “accident of nature,” are in no way grounds for enslavement. As he pressed his case at the Vatican, Mendonça gathered a dossier that included firsthand accounts from Africans in Portugal.

Along with his own experiences, that evidence fueled his eloquent denunciation of “the unjustified methods used to enslave” people in Africa, “from which results the loss of countless Souls,” as well as the “cruelties” practiced against the enslaved in the Americas. Torture with hot wax and tree sap appalled Mendonça; some of the torments, he observed, were worse than those visited on the early Christian martyrs, and all the more shocking because they were meted out by Christians against other Christians. Mendonça also advocated on behalf of the “New Christians,” among them Jews who had converted to Catholicism but were often still pursued by the Inquisition.

Pope Innocent XI responded by calling on Spain and Portugal to at least curtail the cruelty of slavery. But the profitable slave trade continued, crucial to the colonial order that the leaders of these and other European kingdoms had decided to build. Mendonça’s singular legal case lay buried in the Vatican archives for centuries. Now recovered, his story is an example of the constant cross-Atlantic transmission of information and ideas that Gibson and Hazareesingh highlight as integral to the far-reaching struggle for abolition.

During his time in Brazil, Mendonça had contact with the residents of Palmares, a network of nine jointly governed maroon communities, many of whose members were formerly enslaved refugees from the Kongo. (In the 16th century, the Spanish used the term cimarrónes—originally applied to untamed animals—to describe people who escaped from plantations; other colonial powers adopted versions of it, including the English term maroon.) Probably the largest of all such settlements in the Americas, Palmares thrived through much of the 17th century, its population numbering as many as 10,000 or perhaps even 20,000 residents at one point, and it wielded clout on a different scale than smaller fugitive communities in Africa did.

Under a leader named Gana Zumba, Palmares signed a peace treaty with the Portuguese guaranteeing its freedom. It established alliances with Indigenous Brazilians in the area, and its inclusivity extended to people who weren’t enslaved but were fleeing colonial society, including Jews persecuted for their religious beliefs. African culture, language, and religious practices undergirded community life, but a Catholic priest performed baptisms in a church in Palmares adorned with statues of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Blaise, an Armenian martyr whose story of taking refuge from persecution in the Cappadocian mountains resonated with the maroons.

Gibson recounts the trajectory of Palmares as just one part of a much longer history of people seeking freedom and sanctuary in the midst of colonial societies. In Spanish Santo Domingo, the first slave society in the Americas, Africans on a sugar plantation owned by Christopher Columbus’s son rebelled on Christmas Day 1521. They escaped into the hills and allied with an Indigenous group fleeing Spanish control, led by a man named Enriquillo. After 15 years, Spanish troops dispersed the settlement—which had grown to 4,000, and had its own cavalry—but subsequent maroon groups forced colonizers to sign treaties with them.

As the plantation colonies of the British and French Caribbean grew in the late 17th and 18th centuries, escapees formed maroon enclaves there as well. The region also saw a series of mass revolts against slavery. In the 1760s, enslaved organizers in Jamaica launched an uprising that was later known as Tacky’s Revolt. It was, as Gibson writes, “not a small, local eruption, easily snuffed out. Rather, this resistance was akin to a multisite, decentralized guerrilla war, not against a particular king or ruler, but against a social and economic system.”

And then in 1791, the largest such uprising in history took shape in the nearby French colony of Saint-Domingue. It led to the abolition of slavery by France in 1794 and, when Napoleon Bonaparte sought to reenslave the population, to Haiti’s independence from France on January 1, 1804, when the island was rechristened with the original Indigenous name for the territory. Hazareesingh and Gibson emphasize the revolution’s role in articulating a radical idea of universal rights and cultivating new forms of democratic participation. (As the notes in The Great Resistance and Daring to Be Free indicate, the close-knit field relies on scholarly interchange; both authors draw on my work on Haiti, and I gave Hazareesingh feedback, reading suggestions, and a blurb.)

The Haitian Revolution’s success in overthrowing slavery and then establishing a new nation gave rise to a very different archive, including writings by and about its most recognized leader, Louverture, and Haiti’s founder, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. These offer us a personal understanding of the influences that shaped their lives and ideas. Dessalines, for instance, acknowledged his deep debt to the woman he considered his “second mother,” Toya Montou, one of a number of women who participated directly in combat. She taught him about his African roots and during the revolution led her own unit of insurgents.

The dramatic victory in Haiti nourished the imaginations of enslaved people across the hemisphere, helping create what Hazareesingh describes as a “popular encyclopaedia” that was “embedded in songs, music, images, and artefacts, and stories, tales, and myths about the revolution’s heroic leaders and the achievements of the Haitian people.” Brazilian authorities were alarmed in 1805 when they found Black officers in the local militia wearing “miniature portraits of Dessalines around their necks.” Parishioners in Black churches in Philadelphia celebrated the anniversary of Haitian independence, if quietly. In Louisiana, a man named Charles Deslondes led a two-day revolt in 1811, the largest in U.S. history, and almost certainly inspired by the Haitian Revolution. Two decades later, Nat Turner planned his (ultimately thwarted) 1831 rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, to begin on the 40th anniversary of the Haitian Revolution’s start.

From the August 1861 issue: Nat Turner’s Insurrection

The events of the Haitian Revolution reshaped the history of North America: Napoleon’s defeat there prompted him to sell Louisiana—which he had reacquired from Spain as part of his plan to build a French empire in the Americas—to the United States in 1803. The purchase doubled the country’s size, enabling the U.S. to become a bleak outlier: During the next decades, while slavery was being abolished in newly independent Latin American republics and in the British Caribbean, the U.S. expanded slavery into the recently acquired territory.

With the Louisiana Purchase, a huge domestic slave trade got under way, supplying labor to cotton and sugar plantations. Though only roughly 5 percent of the total number of enslaved Africans brought to the New World from the 16th century through the start of the 19th ended up in North America, by the time of the Civil War, the enslaved population had grown to approximately 4 million, mostly native-born. All of their efforts at rebellion in the 19th century were swiftly and brutally suppressed.

Still, other powerful forms of resistance surfaced. Escapes to the North were organized by figures such as Harriet Tubman. Some who had won their freedom, among them Frederick Douglass, wrote powerful autobiographies that were also devastating critiques of slavery. And abolitionist materials produced in the North traveled south. A Mississippi plantation manager complained in 1847 about an enslaved woman named California who had “an idea that she is free” and was passing that idea on to her children. In an echo of Aponte, she had decorated the walls of her cabin with antislavery prints, which were often circulated along with pamphlets.

From the December 1866 issue: Frederick Douglass’s ‘Reconstruction’

When the Civil War began, as many as 500,000 enslaved men and women escaped toward Union lines. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the involvement of 200,000 Black soldiers in the war proved crucial in the Union victory. Some African American recruiters invoked the earlier history of the Haitian Revolution in their pitch, recalling how Black troops in Haiti had secured and protected abolition: Like those forebears, new “black Toussaints” could strike “blow after blow for freedom,” and bring liberation to all of those still enslaved in the South.

As Aponte knew, the way you look at the past shapes your hopes about the present and future. In the U.S., debates about how to understand our experience of slavery and its ultimate demise are as intense as ever, and will continue to be at the core of broader questions about how to narrate our national story. But Hazareesingh and Gibson invite us to see ourselves as inheritors of something much broader too: a powerful history of political thought and on-the-ground resistance—in many forms, always against seemingly insurmountable odds—that stretched across continents and centuries.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gavin Newsom has a 30-page file of reasons the Democrats lost the 2024 presidential election. Bounding across his Sacramento office, he starts listing them: incumbency, inflation, interest rates, Israel—and that’s just the letter I. “Yes, too woke,” he adds. “Yes, 107 days,” referring to the short campaign after Joe Biden’s forced withdrawal. But the California governor distills his party’s problem down to one word. Weak.

Newsom slaps his hand on a marked-up hardback of Bill Clinton’s memoir, brought down from the shelf a minute earlier. “Given the choice,” he tells me, summing up a crucial Clinton insight—one many Democrats still can’t quite seem to grasp—“the American people always support strong and wrong versus weak and right.”

According to prediction markets and early polling, Newsom is the Democrats’ current front-runner for 2028. He is also one of the most visible anti-Trump forces in America. His idea of strength includes a willingness to fight dirty, going lower than Barack Obama could ever imagine, and so his social-media accounts bristle with memes about Donald Trump’s bruised hand and advancing age. “Donald has fallen asleep in his own Cabinet meeting,” he recently asserted on X. Some posts are downright cruel, such as the one about Elon Musk’s estrangement from his transgender child: “We’re sorry your daughter hates you, Elon,” it said.

He also has a high tolerance for risk. Proposition 50, a ballot measure that has redrawn California’s congressional map in favor of the Democrats, was seen as a toss-up when he first backed it last year. The new map was a blatant partisan gerrymander, a departure from the time when the Democrats used to talk up the fairness of independent commissions. Morally wrong, maybe—but do you want to win back the House or not? Prop 50 passed by a two-to-one margin.

Newsom, who is 58, has a memoir coming out next month. This is a traditional rite of passage for people running for president, which he is, even though we are supposed to pretend that he hasn’t decided yet. He has some obvious advantages over the likely competition. As a heterosexual white man from a Catholic background, nothing about his identity is electorally risky. He is tall—6 foot 3—and good-looking in a faintly sinister way: You can imagine him being played by Matthew McConaughey or the vampire dad from Twilight. In a political arena now dominated by podcasts, he can talk until he’s hoarse; as San Francisco mayor, he once uploaded a multipart “State of the City” address to YouTube that lasted more than seven hours.

As for his liabilities, well, the word smarm comes up a lot: The teeth are too white, the hair perfectly gelled. As if to compensate for his overuse of buzzwords—he told me he was “concerned about the significant expansion in the health-care space from a sustainability perspective”—man and brother are strategically deployed to seem folksy. In person, he is enormously charismatic, and is obviously performing. “He is a good communicator,” the Bay Area political strategist Alex Clemens told me. “He tries very hard to be a good communicator, and some people latch on to the trying-hard, instead of the end result.”

Newsom’s core views are also hard to ascertain. Right now, Democrats are divided into multiple camps: the can-do Abundance crew; centrists, who warn about the overreach of “The Groups,” such as the ACLU; Resistance libs, often dismissively referred to as the “wine mom” tendency; and left-wing populists, who think the party should not yield an inch on social issues, but instead focus on bashing billionaires. Newsom is trying to offer something to all four factions. His mentor, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, said last year that his protégé is a “movie star” capable of being elected president—but also that he has never asked Newsom what he believes, “for fear he doesn’t know!”

Read: The week that changed everything for Gavin Newsom

Newsom’s campaign tactics are similarly fluid. At the start of Trump’s second term, the governor offered him an “open hand, not a closed fist,” before casting himself as the leader of the Resistance. He attributes this change to the deployment of the National Guard to his state. “I was shaped by a different consciousness and understanding of our politics,” he told me.

And there’s another problem: California. Newsom was born and bred in a state widely associated with moonbeams, metrosexuality, and macrobiotics. He has never faced a serious challenge from the right, and has instead spent a career among left-wing interest groups whose stances on immigration, drugs, gender, and climate change seem far-out to Middle America. “If you want to see the socialist Biden/Harris future for our country, just take a look at California,” one speaker at the 2020 Republican National Convention said, with the cadences of a carnival barker warning about the apocalypse. “It is a place of immense wealth, immeasurable innovation, and immaculate environment, and the Democrats turned it into a land of discarded heroin needles in parks, riots in streets, and blackouts in homes.”

Who was that speaker? Kimberly Guilfoyle, otherwise known as Gavin Newsom’s ex-wife. Many California Democrats—and even some of Newsom’s friends—still cannot understand why he ever married Guilfoyle, who went on to have an open-casket MAGA makeover and was engaged for a time to Donald Trump Jr.

All of this brings us to the defining question: Who is Gavin Newsom, really, underneath the charm—and the smarm?

Authors write a memoir when there’s something about themselves that they want other people to understand. So what don’t outsiders get about Gavin Newsom?

“The memoir opens up with that question,” Newsom tells me—the question of whether “I’ve become a caricature of myself and contributed to it, as it relates to this perception of privilege and wealth that has dogged me—and at times infuriated, not just frustrated, me.” I run the caricature as I understand it past him: His father was a friend of the Gettys, one of San Francisco’s wealthiest and most well-connected families, and Newsom started his first business with Getty money. “Yeah, you got it, sums it up,” he says. So how is it wrong? “Well, you gotta read the book,” he deadpans.

Newsom’s version is that he grew up between two worlds. His parents divorced when he was still a young child. His late father, Bill, was close to the oil heirs Gordon Getty and John Paul Getty Jr.—so close, in fact, that Bill became an administrator of the Getty family trust and helped deliver the ransom for the kidnapped John Paul Getty III. With the Gettys, Gavin went on safari and watched polar bears in Canada. But at home with his mother, Tessa, life was Wonder bread and mac and cheese.

At his high school in Marin County, north of San Francisco, Newsom was not a great student, but he was a talented first baseman, and he has attributed his acceptance at Santa Clara University to the fact he was “left-handed and could throw a baseball a little bit.” At times, an exaggerated version of his college record has spread, giving the incorrect impression that he played for Santa Clara and was drafted by the Texas Rangers. (A spokesperson has previously said, “He is doing his job, and he cannot spend his entire day correcting people when they make errors about him.”)

Playing baseball “helped me build confidence, got me out of my shell, and so I have deep reverence—I value sports and athletics, and also competition,” Newsom tells me. One of his two podcasts, Politickin’, is co-hosted by the former NFL star Marshawn Lynch—the legendary “Beast Mode”—and the sports agent Doug Hendrickson. The show is raucous, fratty, and frequently profane; in one episode, Lynch told their guest, Jimmy Kimmel, that “you gotta let your nuts hang.” As Kimmel observed: “This has to be the weirdest podcast ever, right?” (Newsom paused Politickin’ during the Palisades Fire crisis, but plans to revive it later this year.)

After college, the young Gavin and his childhood friend Billy Getty founded a wine store called PlumpJack, which has since grown into a restaurant-and-vineyard empire. (The word is a nickname for Shakespeare’s Falstaff, and the title of an opera by Gordon Getty.) “I grew a business with a relatively modest investment from a few members of the Getty family,” Newsom says now. “There were 13 investors.” Then he adds: “I’m not naive as well; I don’t run away from a recognition of the advantages and the privileges that I did enjoy.”

These connections have led to many of Newsom’s unflattering nicknames over the years, such as “Prince Gavin.” “Everybody thinks of Gavin and a silver spoon,” Nancy Pelosi told me. “But that isn’t right.” The former House speaker is a strong supporter of Newsom and recently helped him fundraise for Prop 50. There is even a persistent MAGA folk myth that she is his aunt: In fact, Newsom’s aunt Barbara was once married to Pelosi’s brother-in-law Ron. Pelosi, who has known Newsom since birth, added, “He was a very hard worker in everything that he did, whether it was personally, professionally, and then civically.”

One source of lifelong struggle is his dyslexia. He is an obsessive note taker, a habit born of the condition. He reads a book or a briefing agonizingly slowly, then copies out the best points onto a notepad, before transferring them to yellow index cards. Because of this, he prefers to rely on interrogating nearby people or memorizing information. In the 2000s, this tendency led his staff to nickname him Rain Man. “If you notice, when he speaks, he’s never reading from notes,” Senator Alex Padilla of California, who ran Newsom’s first campaign for lieutenant governor, told me. “So he, in some ways, overcompensates through preparation.”

As a result, Newsom can rattle off talking points with disorienting velocity. When I challenged him on his record as California governor, he machine-gunned me with a list of achievements: “$11 billion to reform the Medicaid system, the most significant reforms to Medicaid in the country; taking our whole-person care pilots and bringing them statewide; getting an 1115 waiver, getting a 1332 waiver from the Feds, all hard work; CalRx, not subsidizing costs, lowering costs—$11 insulin as a proof point of that. You can look down a list: $25 minimum wage for health-care workers, $20 for fast-food workers, no other state in the country, hard-fought battles; 800,000 gig workers now can organize, that was a six-year effort . . .”

I checked these numbers afterward, and although some of the claimed policy triumphs were either arguable or still pending, he was word-perfect on the figures. No wonder he’s desperate to appear on Joe Rogan’s podcast, I thought. He would beast-mode Rogan with a swarm of facts.

Newsom has always, always wanted to be president. In the late ’90s, his Balboa Cafe, in San Francisco’s Cow Hollow neighborhood, was a place where old and new money mixed. “Though barely out of his 20s, he already has a repertoire of politician’s gestures—placing his arm conspiratorily on a listener’s shoulder, punching the air to make a point,” The New York Times reported in 1998.

His childhood friend Lori Puccinelli Stern once organized a charity auction at Planet Hollywood with future Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. They sold off a cigar-smoking-and-chess session with the Terminator star and a date with Newsom, then one of the most eligible bachelors in town. The winners of the latter prize were an older couple in real estate, which surprised the hosts. “We were thinking maybe a young girl who had eyes for Gavin would want this,” Puccinelli Stern told me. “The couple said, ‘We want to have dinner with him and our children, because we want them to get to know someone who we think is probably going to be the president of the United States someday.’” Stern said she wanted to talk to me because too many people saw Newsom as a “cyborg politician” when he was funny and loyal, the kind of guy who, “if you’re stuck in a Turkish prison, mistakenly, he’s your phone call.”

Another close friend, the event impresario Stanlee Gatti, remembers talking with Newsom in the 1990s, when Willie Brown had just appointed his friend to the San Francisco parking commission. Newsom stopped by Gatti’s studio and saw him casting the I Ching, a traditional Chinese method of divination that uses coins or yarrow stalks. Newsom wanted to try it. “The I Ching said, If you’re thinking about running for political, public office—don’t,” Gatti told me. “It said, You are an artist and you are a creator, and you should be doing something that uses that part.”

In Gatti’s telling, Newsom didn’t demur. “I can see it so clearly, right now, him standing up there, and he goes: Okay, that’s it. I guess I’m not running for office.” But Gatti didn’t believe his friend. (I asked Gatti if he would cast the I Ching again, to predict his friend’s future once more. “I need him to throw it,” he said, mulling the idea. If Newsom was willing, Gatti said, “we can do it over the phone.” As I waited, he texted the governor. An answer pinged back in less than a minute: “Too risky.”)

Family connections quickly propelled him upward in local government. Bill Newsom once told San Francisco Weekly that a friend of his helped engineer his son’s appointment to the city’s Board of Supervisors. “Besides,” Newsom’s father said, “they needed a straight white male on the board.”

When he ran for San Francisco mayor, Newsom’s platform was moderate and pro-business, in the model of Senator Dianne Feinstein. His signature policy was “care not cash,” a program to divert welfare spending to housing for the homeless, which he touted as a compassionate answer to Rudy Giuliani’s broken-windows toughness. In the runoff, Newsom narrowly beat the Green candidate, Matt Gonzalez, who became a public defender. “I think it was a closer race than he would have hoped for,” said Padilla, who first met Newsom around this time.

But within two months of taking office, he made a huge gamble: He started issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples—effectively daring the state to strike them down. In hindsight, it’s easy to forget how provocative this was. Democrats believed that gay marriage was a losing issue, and that Newsom’s actions risked a conservative backlash for little practical gain.

Kate Kendell, then the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, remembers getting a phone call from the mayor’s office on a Friday afternoon saying it planned to start issuing licenses the following Monday. She was wary. “Things felt very perilous and tenuous, and it felt like a firecracker moment,” she told me. When Newsom’s office said it would go ahead anyway, Kendell called the lesbian activists Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, partners of more than 50 years. She asked if the couple, who were then 79 and 83, wanted to be the first to get a license.

Newsom decided at the last minute not to conduct the ceremony himself—“He felt like it would be too much about him,” Kendell said—and so County Assessor Mabel Teng married the couple, who had arrived in matching pantsuits, turquoise and purple. Newsom gave them a copy of the California constitution as a wedding gift. “It was pretty extraordinary,” Kendell said, “but he paid holy hell for it. He got angry calls from Dianne Feinstein. He got angry calls from Barney Frank”—an openly gay congressman—“that the Democratic establishment was not happy with him.”

Newsom believes that he was not invited to speak at the 2004 Democratic National Convention because of the backlash. When John Kerry lost the White House that year, some Democrats blamed Newsom. “I believe it did energize a very conservative vote,” Feinstein said at the time. It was “too much, too fast, too soon.”

The young politician didn’t fold, but he did brood. “I mean, come on, maybe Democrats shouldn’t have supported civil rights in the ’60s,” he told a public-radio station immediately after the election. The party, and the country, has since validated his gamble. In 2008, the California Supreme Court voted to allow gay marriages—for a brief window, before a ballot measure overturned the ruling. The second time round, Newsom personally married Phyllis and Del at city hall. “Del was much more frail now, but they wore the same pantsuits . . . It was a huge celebratory spectacle,” Kendell told me, adding: “I think public opinion had really started to shift.”

In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage across the country. “I know change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long,” said President Obama, welcoming the ruling. “But compared to so many other issues, America’s shift has been so quick.”

For Newsom, the fallout from the gay weddings was nothing compared with the implosion of his first marriage. Newsom had married Guilfoyle, an assistant district attorney turned television host, in 2001. Her “something borrowed” was one of Ann Getty’s tiaras, and the reception for their 600 guests was held at the Getty mansion.

The marriage was short and tempestuous. Guilfoyle’s television career in New York pulled her away from the West Coast, and Newsom would spend Sunday evenings with Puccinelli Stern, her husband, and their new baby, watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and eating pizza. She told me he would turn up wearing a baseball cap, and when the lucky families saw their new home, he “would put his hat down so we didn’t see him getting emotional.”

Guilfoyle took a somewhat unorthodox approach to life as a political consort. Filling in for Newsom at a gay awards dinner, she told the crowd: “I know that many of you wanted to see my husband, and some of you had questions out there. Is he hot? Yeah. Is he hung? Yeah.” The couple infamously posed together, sprawled on a rug, for the September 2004 issue of Harper’s Bazaar, in a story headlined “The New Kennedys.” The rug, and surrounding house, belonged to Ann Getty, and the magazine’s fashion editor at the time was Jacqui Getty, who was then Ann’s daughter-in-law. Asked about Newsom’s ambitions, Guilfoyle replied: “Do I think he could be president of the United States? Absolutely. I’d gladly vote for him.”

Within months of the story’s publication, however, the couple announced their split. What followed was a dark time for Newsom: He was frequently seen with a glass in his hand at local restaurants, although a spokesperson maintained that he had no alcohol problems. The newly single 38-year-old “Mayor McHottie” had relationships with a Scientologist, a 19-year-old model, and—most damagingly—his former appointments secretary Ruby Rippey Gibney, who was married to one of his closest aides.

Days after coming clean about the last of these relationships, he announced that he would seek treatment because “I will be a better person without alcohol in my life.” For a decade, the media reported that he had been to rehab, but in 2018, The Sacramento Bee corrected this assumption. Newsom told the paper he had sought only counseling with a local therapist and later resumed drinking socially. More than one person I spoke with wondered whether Newsom had pleaded alcohol abuse at the time to avoid the charge of moral degeneracy. When the #MeToo movement brought the scandal back into the news, Rippey Gibney wrote on Facebook that she had not felt coerced into the relationship, as a “free-thinking, 33-yr old adult married woman & mother.” Around the same time, Newsom revisited the affair. “I acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I learned an enormous amount from it,’’ he said.

By the late 2010s, Newsom had a personal reason for supporting the #MeToo movement; his second wife is Jennifer Siebel Newsom, an outspoken feminist and a sexual-assault survivor. She was involved with two films about gender roles in America: Miss Representation, about girls, in 2011, and The Mask You Live In, which tackled men’s issues, in 2015. She testified that she’d been raped by Harvey Weinstein in 2005. (The jury could not reach a verdict in her case.) In keeping with her feminist principles, Siebel Newsom is not California’s first lady, but its “first partner.”

Their relationship started with a blind date at a fundraising gala at the Yerba Buena Center in 2006, and within 18 months, Newsom had proposed with a Tiffany diamond ring. They married that summer in a field in Montana, and Stanlee Gatti did the decor. The bride rode to the aisle sidesaddle on a black stallion; the groom wore a tan suit; the theme was “Out of Africa.” The ceremony was conducted by Carol Simone, a “modern day mystic” whose website describes her as a medium, an astrologer, and a tarot practitioner. Bill Newsom arrived in Gordon Getty’s plane.

The Newsoms now have four children, ages 9 to 16: Montana, Brooklynn, Hunter, and Dutch. Gatti told me that marriage and kids had settled Newsom; he had run into his friend and his son at a museum one morning during the pandemic, and noticed how relaxed he looked. “He had his hair floppy. Some people didn’t even recognize him.” (Newsom’s hair, usually slicked back, has been a source of admiration and horror for two decades. His secret, he once told American Idol’s Ryan Seacrest, was L’Oréal Total Control Clean Gel.)

Amid all of his personal upheaval, Newsom ran for—and easily won—reelection as mayor. He was such an obvious shoo-in that the race became a kind of circus: His opponents included a performance artist, a nudist activist, and the owner of a sex club. Tellingly, both the artist, “Chicken John” Rinaldi, and the sex-club owner, Michael Powers, told me they no longer live in San Francisco. Rinaldi was priced out and lives in Isleton, an hour east of the Bay. Powers moved right politically and didn’t feel welcome in California anymore. He now lives in Nevada. “I’m definitely a tried-and-true libertarian,” Powers said. “I believe that gay guys ought to be able to protect their weed fields with assault rifles.”

After Newsom won his second term, in 2007, Gatti designed an inauguration ceremony with 2,000 yellow roses spread across two giant urns, to fill the grand scale of city hall. The very same day, Newsom attended the swearing-in of the city’s newly reelected district attorney, Kamala Harris. The two have known each other for decades, but they are not close, sharing neither friends nor a political philosophy. In her book 107 Days, Harris recounts that Newsom did not pick up when she called him to discuss Joe Biden dropping out of the race in the summer of 2024—and, by implication, her need for a running mate. Newsom has said that he did not recognize her number.

The looming end of his second term as mayor presented Newsom with a problem. The obvious next step was to run for California governor in 2010, but his candidacy faltered once the old warhorse Jerry Brown—who had already served in the position in the ’70s and ’80s—made it clear he was entering the race. Newsom settled for lieutenant governor, a largely ceremonial position that he won easily. He chafed at his lack of responsibilities, and took advantage of Brown’s absences to pull stunts such as naming the avocado the official state fruit.

Newsom essentially spent eight years treading water—or, as I put it to him in Sacramento, just vibing. “I appreciate that perspective,” he replied, a politician’s phrase meaning screw you. He has now recast these years of avocado-bothering as a “gestation period of sorts,” where he spent time “working with the Brookings Institute, working with McKinsey, working on best-practices policy, urban policy, ultimately writing the first economic plan for the state.” An unhappy Jerry Brown “tried to torpedo me on that,” Newsom told me, and refused to appoint a committee to take the plan forward. (Brown declined my interview request.) “I was literally neutered,” he added. “It was quite brilliant, looking back as a gubernatorial play. I despised it at the time. Now I appreciate it.”

To fill the time, he hosted The Gavin Newsom Show on Current TV, interviewing a pre-bonkers Elon Musk about Tesla, listening to Oliver Stone praise California’s weed, and trying on Sergey Brin’s Google Glass. He also wrote a none-more-2010s book called Citizenville—a title inspired by the game Farmville—which discussed how digital innovation could transform government.

In 2018, after Brown retired, Newsom won the governor’s race with 62 percent of the vote. He has taken up a number of fashionable liberal causes, although some of these have fared badly on contact with electoral reality. For example, he declared that the state “could finally beat Big Oil” in 2013, and signed legislation that banned fracking and restricted oil drilling near sensitive sites—then approved a law allowing 2,000 new drilling licenses in Kern County this past September, citing high gas prices.

The Stanford professor Keith Humphreys worked on a blue-ribbon commission to reform cannabis laws with Newsom in the 2010s. Their original vision, he told me, was one that prioritized public health and put social justice over profit. “Gavin articulated this beautifully in the press,” Humphreys said. But the legislation that ended up being drafted and approved by voters “weakened the public-good aspirations of our commission and created a more profit-driven model, and Gavin didn’t utter a word of protest. Is this because he didn’t know the details were different, or is it because he didn’t mind, because he gets a lot of campaign donations from the cannabis industry? I genuinely don’t know the answer to that even now.” Legalization meant that big producers, operating on tiny margins, moved in and actively looked for new customers.

In September, Newsom signed a bill to roll back taxes on the legal-cannabis industry, because the regulatory burden has left it struggling to compete with the black market. Doing something that is sold as socially progressive, but ends up benefiting big-money donors, and then wrapping it up in so much regulation and taxation that the policy collapses under its own weight—how dysfunctionally California is that?

But the state’s biggest challenge is the cost of living—specifically, housing. Newsom has recently started name-checking the Abundance movement, which aims to convince Democrats that overregulation and NIMBYism are holding back the growth of blue states. He has signed a series of bills meant to make housing construction easier. But these efforts have yet to bear much fruit, and the candidates to succeed him as governor—he is term-limited—are making housing affordability a centerpiece of their campaigns, too. Mid-tier home prices in California are around double the national average.

“He’s much given to—like Trump, in a way—making these grand pronouncements about how something’s the greatest ever, how this is going to be the most wonderful thing,” the veteran California journalist Jerry Roberts told me, “and then his record is littered with failures.” Still, you try to get anything passed in California, a state with strong labor unions, a cadre of well-funded lobbyists, and a masochistic addiction to requiring approval via ballot measure.

The minutiae of policy may matter less in a national election, however, than the overall sense that California is too far left—and so its governor must be, too. Newsom twice supported ballot measures to repeal the death penalty in California, boasts about providing health care to undocumented immigrants, and in 2014 was the only statewide elected official to back Proposition 47, which reclassified some nonviolent offenses as misdemeanors rather than felonies. At the time, he said that there was “a growing, rational thinking around moving in a new direction” on crime and rehabilitation that other politicians were scared to embrace. Opponents drew a direct line between those reforms and the locked plastic cases around the goods in many San Francisco stores. I brought up Prop 47 as Exhibit A in the Republican argument that Newsom is too liberal for Middle America. “California is one of the toughest felony thresholds for shoplifting in America, period,” he said, adding that the felony limit is $950, whereas in supposedly tough Texas, it is $2,500. To Newsom’s mind, the charge that he is soft on crime is “complete mythology, and makes you question the press.”

On social issues, Newsom has already acted to mitigate the weakness of being associated with Californian wokery. Two of the first guests on his interview podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, were Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, ensuring that people actually listened to the show. Kirk advised him to “run to the middle” and say “no men in female sports.” Newsom conceded the broader point—“I think it’s an issue of fairness” —before retreating to the standard Democratic talking points: Not many athletes are involved. This is a marginalized community with high suicide rates. The Republicans had been able to “weaponize the issue.” But even those tentative words were enough, Newsom told me, to cause a huge backlash within his own tent. Two members of the California legislature’s LGBTQ caucus declared that they were “profoundly sickened and frustrated” by his words.

“What’s so interesting is how painful that position is to many members of my party,” he says now. “And I’ve lost relationships and friendships because of that position.” He argues that his record of pro-LGBTQ bills gives him the ability to look for compromises; he also has a trans godson, 33-year-old Nats Getty. “I have someone I love dearly who went through a transition,” he says.

Hasn’t America been waiting for a politician who can hold this middle ground, I ask, someone who can say that we should treat everyone with respect and dignity, but also acknowledge that in some circumstances—sports, prisons—biological sex matters? “I agree,” Newsom says, before becoming uncharacteristically ineloquent. “Yeah. It’s … I … I’ve just—it’s been—it’s been really, it’s been an interesting—” He is “hesitating,” he tells me, because he has just recorded a podcast reflecting on the year, including his conversation with Kirk, who was assassinated in September.

Another reason for hesitation might be that California has other laws that must have the makers of Republican attack ads salivating with anticipation. In 2020, the state passed S.B. 132, allowing male criminals to self-identify into women’s prisons. One of those transferred, Tremaine Carroll, is awaiting trial on charges of raping two female inmates. (Carroll denies the charges.) A.B. 1955, passed in July 2024, prevents schools from having to inform parents if their children have adopted new names and pronouns. I bring up the latter example with Newsom. He reframes it, saying that the law was aimed to stop “commanding that teachers become snitches and say, You’ll be fired if you don’t snitch on a child. And it wasn’t about trans issues. It wasn’t just transitioning. It was around sexual orientation generally.” Under the Republicans’ preferred laws, he says, “if Bobby was going to dress up as a woman, you were compelled to then turn that child in.”

Heading into a general election, Newsom has a choice on how to treat his policy record: full-throated defense or brutal disownment. He could also try to reject the premise, rehabilitating the image of California as a place of innovation and dynamism, rather than the socialist dystopia conjured up by his ex-wife. Newsom is already thinking about this strategy, arguing that some people suffer from what he jokingly calls “California Derangement Syndrome.” His staff recently gave him a 1977 Time article about how the California “dream fizzled”—to add to the 1994 Time article decrying “clogged freeways, eye-stinging smog, despoiled landscapes, polluted beaches, water shortages, unaffordable housing, overcrowded schools and beleaguered industries.” His point is that people love to declare the end of the Golden State.

Pelosi too pushed back on the idea that the rest of the country hates California. “I don’t know that we attract hatred,” the former speaker told me. “We have jealousy.” Padilla also disputes the popular characterization of the state. “There’s 58 counties in California, the majority of which are Republican,” the senator told me, adding, “It’s a lot more diverse than people think.”

That might well be, but unlike Bill Clinton—who succeeded as a Democrat in conservative Arkansas—Newsom has not yet shown he can outperform his party. He won his second governor’s race, in 2022, with 59 percent of the vote. Two years later, Harris won California’s electoral college with 58 percent. Newsom’s policies on capital punishment and gun control “are very popular among the Democratic base,” Jerry Roberts told me, “but I don’t know how that’s going to sell in western Pennsylvania, or South Carolina for that matter.”

All right, let’s talk about the tweets. The redistricting fight showed one version of Newsom’s strength, as he ran an expensive anti-Trump campaign focused on the threat to democracy and civil rights. His online presence, however, demonstrates that he can also mock Trump like a mean ninth grader. This is the work of a team of young staffers, whose Sacramento-office door carries an AI-generated image of Newsom being prayed over by Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson, and Hulk Hogan (RIP). Newsom is not Michelle Obama: When they go low, Newsom’s team goes even lower. (Despite this freewheeling approach, Newsom is not an informal boss; his staff calls him Governor, not Gavin.)

On X, the governor’s account pumps out all-caps posts in a pitch-perfect imitation of the president’s style. When Fox News attacked Newsom, he released a statement that read: “FOX HATES THAT I AM AMERICA’S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR (‘RATINGS KING’) SAVING AMERICA – WHILE TRUMP CAN’T EVEN CONQUER THE ‘BIG’ STAIRS ON AIR FORCE ONE ANY MORE!!!” Last month, he released a fake physical from the “California Department of Peak Excellence,” claiming that he remains “the healthiest person alive and ever to live.”

These Trump parodies are aimed at journalists and activists and have already garnered headlines such as “How Gavin Newsom Trolled His Way to the Top of Social Media.” On TikTok, he pursues a more populist strategy, pumping out caustic videos steeped in meme culture. He has 2.9 million followers there, the same as conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. In October, he joined a Fortnite game with the popular streamer ConnorEatsPants, as an overture to young men. (“Fifty-one percent of 18- to 24-year-olds have never asked a girl on a date,” he told me at one point, shaking his head. “Fifty-one percent. That’s just scary.”) For their dads, meanwhile, there’s the podcast with Marshawn Lynch.

Newsom has also taken his happy-if-bitchy-warrior act into hostile territory by appearing on MAGA podcasts. In July, he spent four hours talking with Shawn Ryan, a former Navy SEAL and Blackwater contractor who shares Joe Rogan’s suspicion of the “deep state” and America’s “forever” wars. Newsom accepted the gift of a pistol, a Sig Sauer P365-Xmacro, saying, “I’m not anti-gun at all.” (The NRA was unimpressed, noting that Newsom wants a Twenty-Eighth Amendment to raise the age of gun ownership, institute waiting periods, and ban assault weapons.) He burnished his common-man credentials by owning up to a 960 score on the SAT—below average—and claiming not to be able to pronounce “bona fides.” He recounted a conversation where he used the word Latinx. “And then my chief of staff, who happens to be Hispanic, goes, ‘Would you shut up?’”

Newsom can handle these breezy, expletive-filled conversations because he has none of Harris’s paralyzing caution. “He can be very cautious and calculating, as any politician with a 30-year track record would probably have to be,” Alex Clemens, the political strategist, told me. “But he also, on multiple occasions, including in this moment now, has shown a remarkable boldness in being able to say: I’m going off script.” (Trump’s military operation in Venezuela was not one of those times, however. Instead of posting a spicy tweet, Newsom released an official statement about the need for “democracy, human rights, and stability” that could have come from any Democrat.)

In the Ryan interview, Newsom said he was a fan of The Joe Rogan Experience—but “he won’t have me on the show, by the way.” Rogan left California during COVID, and is still energized by annoyance at its masking and school-closure rules. The governor has turned Rogan’s snub into another running feud, in posts baiting the “snack-sized podcaster.” Newsom is apparently betting that the next presidential election will be fought based on good vibes and naked aggression. “You would have never heard Gavin do these things—like troll Trump in the way he’s doing now,” Stanlee Gatti told me. But Newsom is “smart enough to know that’s the only way you can fight an idiot like Trump.”

The instant I mention this combative social-media strategy, Newsom knows where I’m going. “We didn’t like the Marie Antoinette?” he says, joshing me. He is referring to the haunting AI-generated image that he’d circulated of Trump decked out in pearls and a towering gray wig. Appealing to his press aide Bob Salladay, sitting quietly in the corner of the room, he adds: “Did we offend her?” The Trump image, Newsom suggests, has upset my “European mindset.”

I make a face to indicate that my problem is not, in fact, that I am a French monarchist. What bothered me, I say, was a post on X addressed to the right-wing influencer Chaya Raichik, better known as Libs of TikTok. Repeating a comment that Trump had recently made to a female reporter, the post from Newsom’s official account read: “Quiet, piggy.” Is it right to bring back misogyny to public life? “That’s good feedback, Bob,” concedes Newsom, looking precisely zero percent abashed. The piggy post was, he argues, just a “play” on Trump’s own words. Newsom insists that his posts are simply holding up a “reflective mirror” to the president, trying to show America what has become normalized.

Plus, Newsom adds with a mischievous look, it’s funny to watch “the propaganda networks, the Pravda networks, Fox and others, that seemed so taken aback by it, so deeply offended by such childish behavior on my part. Wash his poor mouth with soap!” Even those who think his posts are wrong can’t deny that they demonstrate aggression and ambition. If nothing else, this iteration of Newsom is not a snowflake.

In person, Newsom showed more depth than I expected from his hey-man-wassup podcast appearances and his sassy online clapbacks. He is self-aware, and he can be self-deprecating, too. “I know you’re saying, your lying eyes,” he told me, when I looked skeptical about his claim to have reduced homelessness in the state. He has even found a way to deal with his single biggest screwup—his COVID-era decision to attend a birthday party at the French Laundry, the three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Yountville where the prix fixe menu starts at $425 a person. (The gathering was for his friend, the lobbyist Jason Kinney, who’d led the campaign to legalize marijuana.)

That meal might be the single worst entertainment choice in American political history since Lincoln decided to see Our American Cousin. The French Laundry incident drove support for a recall election in 2021, although Newsom won by a margin of almost two to one.

The governor has come up with an unusual approach to the scandal: unconditional apology. When Ryan told Newsom that, before their conversation, he despised many of his actions, his guest concurred. “I’d despise me for the shit I read too—I despise me for the French Laundry,” he said, pointing emphatically at Ryan. “I beat the shit out of myself for that. And everyone who criticized me is goddamn right.” The abject contrition left Ryan with nowhere to go.

The most pleasant surprise of meeting Newsom was discovering that he has thought deeply about the history and future of the Democratic Party. He has referred to himself as a “Sargent Shriver Democrat,” after the architect of the War on Poverty and the founding director of the Peace Corps. (Shriver also benefited from connections with an extremely powerful family.) The hallway outside Newsom’s office is lined with photographs taken from the train that brought Robert F. Kennedy’s body from his funeral in New York City to his grave in Arlington National Cemetery. These offer an extraordinary portrait of the United States at a particularly unsettled moment: a cool ’60s couple on a motorbike; a row of kids in height order, lined up in their underwear to pay tribute; men with their hats doffed, held against their chest.

The photographs are a reminder of the decency of ordinary Americans, and a memento mori, a warning of the risks to which Newsom is exposing himself. He reveres Kennedy and frequently refers to his speeches; he used to be friendly with his son RFK Jr. until the latter went full MAGA. Even now, there’s a touch of wistfulness in how he talks about the younger Kennedy. When I bring up Newsom’s morning routine—lemon water, sit-ups, cold plunge, a regimen that reminds me of Christian Bale in American Psycho—I concede that it is healthier than my recent diet of hotel-breakfast bacon shot through with chemical preservatives. “See, this is where RFK and I agree—on ultra-processed foods,” he says.

On the day we met, Newsom had so far supplemented his lemon water with a smoothie and chicken salad. Looking at the lean figure in front of me, in a finely tailored tweed jacket, sneakers, and incongruous Millennial ankle socks, I resist the urge to ask if he tracks his macros. The outfit is Newsom’s usual style, taking him from podcast to potluck: unstuffy without being quite casual either. “I did send him a text the other day and said: Do I need to buy you a new shirt?” Gatti said. “Because it seems like he wears that blue—it looks like blue denim or something—I feel like he wears it all the time.” Newsom was indeed wearing it for our interview, having come straight from recording his end-of-year podcast. Maybe he has 90 identical ones.

Tom Nichols: MAGA world is so close to getting it

Several of my interviewees had likened Newsom to Bill Clinton. Newsom had retrieved his annotated copy of Clinton’s My Life from his office shelf after I told him that the title of his own memoir, Young Man in a Hurry, was oddly reminiscent of the last line of Clinton’s prologue: “Even when I wasn’t sure where I was going, I was always in a hurry.” Newsom’s title actually comes from a 2009 Economist article that described his time as mayor as “a stimulus package for the conservative movement,” but he was delighted at the unintentional echo: “I have a soft spot and a bit of a bias towards President Clinton, as you may or may not know.”

The two men share some of the same strengths—personal charm, ease with all kinds of people—and the same weaknesses for rich friends, the high life, and the ladies. A dog, maybe, but an alpha dog, masculine without being macho. Newsom’s personal history has more dents in the bumper than, say, blameless Pete Buttigieg’s does, but I’m not sure that voters care anymore—better a record of wild mistakes than one of perfect, cautious tedium.

Toward the end of our conversation, I asked Newsom for his thoughts on a set of proposals for the next president outlined by the legal scholar Cass Sunstein: restricting the pardon power, plus a strong presumption against personal lawsuits brought by the president, or prosecuting members of the previous administration.

“I’m suing Fox,” Newsom replied. “A $787 million defamation lawsuit, so you’re talking to the wrong person.” (The legal action, over a host who accused Newsom of lying, is another piece of trolling: The governor is seeking the same amount Fox News paid to Dominion Voting Systems for airing false claims that its machines were rigged in 2020.) As for the pardons, he had a batch on his desk right now, so “it’s not an academic exercise for me.” He thought that formally restricting the pardon power was less important than electing a president who wouldn’t abuse it. “It’s about temperance. It’s about wisdom, the Stoic values. It’s about justice. You can go through all of them, all four. Character has to be represented in the person we put in that office.” But Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in the name of national unity, I said. Would blue America accept a leader who drew a line under Trumpism, rather than promising to litigate its alleged offenses?

“There’s a sort of romantic version if you’re writing the script and you’ve got a nice soundtrack in the background,” Newsom said. “At the inaugural, the next president announces that he’s turning the page—” He caught himself. “Or she is turning the page on all of this. Throngs of boos, maybe, in the audience; I don’t know. ’Cause there’s a sense of vengeance and two can play this game, fight fire with fire.” At the same time, he thought that the country was exhausted. “There is an Isaiah part of all of this: We need whoever the next president is to be a ‘repairer of the breach.’ That should be a big part of the messaging for the next president. I hope they can maybe read the serenity prayer.”

These words might sound strange coming from a man who recently posted an AI-generated video of Trump in handcuffs. But I suspect that Gavin Newsom has a two-part strategy for reaching the presidency: wrestle with MAGA until the midterms, and then pivot to the high (and center) ground with kumbaya and jobs of the future for 2028. He admires Ronald Reagan’s final address as president, he said, a paean to immigration and the flaming torch of Lady Liberty. He must be longing to give a speech like that in a presidential campaign.

Until then, though, he is fighting a dirty war, one that does not observe the political equivalent of the Geneva Convention. Rather than demand respect from Republicans who won’t give it, he is getting right down in the muck with them, blasting Musk’s parenting and posting photographs of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein. Newsom’s communications director even called the singer Nicki Minaj a “stupid hoe” for criticizing the governor. This, to Newsom, is being strong; the right are the fainthearted schoolmarms now. His merchandise store has a page touting MAGA-branded kneepads, for “all your groveling to Trump needs—now in Republican red.”

Apple actually releases a decent amount of open source code. A lot of it is required by compliance, but other useful projects (like WebKit) are still maintained by them.

There&#39;s an ancient version of Bash that Apple maintains in order to avoid GPL v3. Perhaps that&#39;s useful to people who want to make an operating system for their device but don&#39;t want to comply with a very common open source license.

Apple is not obliged to release Darwin, as it is BSD licences, yet they do. That in itself is commendable.

This will lead to two things: more paywalls to replace the forgone ad revenue, and more service providers discontinuing service in Vietnam.

I suggest that this will create new, better advertisements.

One of the problems with advertising is little to no feedback on bad ads.  They negotiate with the media company, not the media consumer.   The media company will put up with far more than the consumer, but the consumer eventually leaves the media customer if they make bad advertisements.

The truth is internet advertisement has a HORRIBLE click through rate.  TV, Radio, Newspapers, Magazines, etc. all have better effects and that is why they charge more.  They are worth the extra money.

We all know that most people do not sit around and watch the 30 second or more advertisement on their phones.  We look away, check our subway stop, pay attention to the movie our parents/kids are watching in the same room, etc. etc.

5 seconds is a good deal for the advertisers.  We actually watch that.

So lets stop letting these morons think they are tricking us into watching long internet ads.  We are not, they are wasting their money and our time.

One of the problems with advertising is little to no feedback on bad ads.Can you think of a good ad? 
I certainly clicked on Google ads but I don&#39;t know that I have seen a tolerable video ad on the Internet. You&#39;d think that statistically a few of them would be tolerable or amusing. But the only ads I remember is when I&#39;d rather pay a little extra to a competitor than give money to a company whose obnoxious ad I saw.

The only effective form of advertising for me is giving out free samples of your product to reviewers. Of course, if your product is crap, or relies on a reality distortion field to sell, that isn&#39;t very effective either.

One of the problems with advertising is little to no feedback on bad ads.This won&#39;t help that. Whatever meaningful feedback it generates will be completely overwhelmed by people who feel that all ads are bad, that it is inherently to advertising, that advertising cannot be good, and the people who do it should be buried in a shallow grave with quicklime.Any other kind of feedback will be statistical noise.

It will lead to 10 ads that are each five seconds long and sequenced together.

How would one skip the ads on Times Square? [timessquarenyc.org]

This is why we couldn&#39;t beat them in that one weird old war.

Well it&#39;s one, two, three, what are we fighting for?Don&#39;t ask me but come on ladsDon&#39;t want unskippable ads!And it&#39;s five, six, seven, we&#39;re heading for those pearly gates,Look out, uh-oh, don&#39;t be a noobWe&#39;ve roused the wrath of YouTube!

            <div id="article-text">...the only way to know for sure is to go there, poke into it, and sniff around. Europa is subject to tidal heating which provides energy, and there may be under-water volcanoes or geysers that can provide nutrients from lower layers. Its neighboring moon, Io, is chalk full of volcanic activity.

Unfortunately, we can attempt no landing there.

Io and Europa are geologically very different bodies, though.

You may as well say, &quot;But Earth has liquid oceans!&quot;



Io is a terrestrial planet. Europa is an ice ball with considerably less rock to absorb energy. It&#39;s probably telling that there is no evidence whatsoever of non-ice tectonics, while it&#39;s neighbor, as you pointed out, looks like Vulcan&#39;s forge.



That all being said, one thing Europa is known to do, is circulate shit that lands on its surface into its subsurface ocean, and while it probably doesn&#39;t have any volcanic activity, as you pointed out- its neighbor is spewing its innards all over the inner Jovian system.If there are any chemicals in the rocky core of Europa that could be stirred into the water column, the continual circulation through the eons has probably pulled quite a bit out. It would cause erosion on the surface layers at the very least, and if it&#39;s violent enough, may even cause fissures that travel fairly deep, depending on how long any given strong current might last.Or at least that would be the &quot;hopeful&quot; take on its basic chemical possibilities.

Since the demise of Roe v. Wade, red-state lawmakers have been looking for political cover for unpopular criminal abortion bans, and a simple strategy has emerged: stressing that bans in theory afford access in exceptional cases that voters overwhelmingly support, such as medical emergencies. The goal of this maneuver is straightforward. For voters who are conflicted about abortion, a focus on exceptions makes bans moderate and reasonable. But a major decision on Tuesday by the Wyoming Supreme Court striking down the state’s abortion ban suggests that abortion exceptions are fast becoming a Catch-22 for the GOP—a potential political lifeline that can create real trouble in court.

To appreciate why abortion exceptions can create legal headaches for Republicans, it helps to understand the Wyoming litigation. A group of patients, doctors, and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the state’s abortion bans under Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution, passed as part of the backlash to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The amendment recognizes a right to make health care decisions. The plaintiffs argued that this right was fundamental and encompassed people’s decision to terminate a pregnancy. The state responded that abortion wasn’t health care—it was the intentional taking of human life—and that even if abortion were health care, the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life was enough to justify its ban. This focus on protecting life made strategic sense; all five justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court were appointed by Republicans, and polls suggest that even Americans who support legal abortion think fetal life has value, despite their opposition to the sweeping criminalization of decisions about pregnancy.

That’s where the plaintiffs pointed to the state law’s abortion exceptions: If the state really valued protecting fetal life, and if abortion wasn’t health care, the plaintiffs argued, these specific exceptions were a funny way of showing it.

Take the state’s exceptions for fatal fetal abnormalities, which apply only if a physician expects that a newborn’s death will occur within days of a live birth. The court asked how this exception made any sense. How did the state protect life by making women in other cases when death of the newborn was just as certain—but who had a longer timeline to sit with that doomed outcome—carry their pregnancies to term? Given that pregnancy could pose risks to abortion seekers, the justices thought the fetal-abnormality exception threatened patients’ health without advancing the state’s supposed goals.

The same was true of Wyoming’s exceptions for medical emergencies, which explicitly excluded mental health crises, such as depression or psychosis, during pregnancy. The state presented no evidence that mental health wasn’t an issue during pregnancy—and no wonder: Mental health conditions accompany a significant number of pregnancies and can lead to seriously adverse outcomes.

Even the state’s rape and incest exception was a problem. The court’s justices didn’t see any connection between the state’s supposed goal of protecting all life in the womb and allowing abortions in cases of sexual abuse, and neither should anyone else. If the state believes that life or even rights begin at fertilization, it’s hard to comprehend why that wouldn’t be true in instances of sexual assault too.

That Wyoming’s abortion exceptions were weird and incoherent shouldn’t be a great surprise. In recent years, any abortion-ban exception reflects an inherently odd compromise between the demands of anti-abortion lobbyists and the electoral needs of GOP lawmakers. Republicans want to win election. That requires keeping a lid on the most heartbreaking stories, narratives that can shape the vote well outside the state where a tragedy has occurred. Abortion opponents want as many abortions as possible stopped, with the exception of a vanishingly small number of serious threats to life.

Conservative lawmakers thus propose exceptions to make abortion bans seem less harsh. Exceptions, ultimately, are a mere messaging strategy, one that undermines the legal case for abortion bans.

That’s reflected in the oddball design of many exceptions. Medical-emergency exceptions, for example, are meant not so much to give physicians real discretion in addressing urgent conditions as to rule out certain cases (such as threats to mental health) that abortion foes dismiss as “abortion on demand.” Rape-and-incest exceptions, like Wyoming’s, often contain reporting requirements intended to ferret out patients who “cry rape,” a solution in search of a problem in a culture in which sexual violence is massively underreported and rarely prosecuted. In a big-picture sense, exceptions are intended to broadcast that abortion bans are far less harsh than they appear, but on closer examination, they’re designed as much to reassure conservative lawmakers that people won’t be able to get abortions anyway.

And exceptions don’t work—by design. Historically, very few patients have sought out abortions under exceptions. That trend has continued—so much so that red states like Texas and Kentucky have passed laws said to clarify that some abortions are justified under state law. That state of affairs suits conservative lawmakers, who seek the political benefits of exceptions with none of the real abortion access they might afford.

The Wyoming Supreme Court’s ruling in State v. Johnson sends a message that this have-it-both-ways strategy on exceptions won’t always work as Republicans expect. The court saw the very same inconsistencies of exceptions as a sign that they didn’t deliver on the state’s purported goals.

It’s not clear what will come next in fights about abortion exceptions. More challenges like Johnson might come before state supreme courts, given that a number of conservative states, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, and Florida, have similar health amendments in their constitutions. But Republicans are doubling down on exceptions as a strategy: In Missouri, for example, voters will decide on whether to repeal a reproductive rights amendment passed in 2024. GOP lawmakers have tried to package the repeal amendment as allowing abortion in exceptional cases, like medical emergencies.

Republicans may think this strategy is working; some polls suggest that supporters of abortion rights are less passionate about the issue than they once were. That likely has much more to do with conservatives’ struggles to enforce abortion bans—abortion seems more, not less, common in many ban states since the fall of Roe—than with exceptions. But even when voters are willing not to look hard at what an exception really says and does, the Wyoming decision shows that the same might not be true of courts.

The Trump administration’s justifications for bombing Venezuela and arresting its president shifted in real time this weekend. Was this a national security–related counternarcotics operation, an oil heist, or a regime-change play to topple a dictator?

That lack of clarity—combined with the administration’s propensity to, well, tell a lot of lies—only added to the mass confusion over what’s really going on. After all, Donald Trump’s Venezuela adventure isn’t an isolated incident, and it’s best understood in proper historical context: the long tail of U.S. intervention in Latin America.

To help make sense of what just happened, and to get answers on what might happen next, I turned to Tiziano Breda. He’s a senior analyst covering Latin America and the Caribbean at ACLED, the independent conflict-monitoring organization that tracks political violence and protests worldwide. Breda has spent more than a decade studying Latin American politics and security.

In our conversation, he unpacks how this operation fits into the long arc of U.S. intervention in the region, the internal dynamics of Venezuela’s ruling “Chavista” coalition, the role of oil, and why the most dangerous consequence of this moment may not be what happens next in Caracas, but what it signals across the world. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: There’s so much in flux right now. What are the most important things we still don’t know about what’s happening between the United States and Venezuela?

Tiziano Breda: There are at least three variables that remain unclear. The first is how this will play out inside Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed. What has this generated within the Chavista power structure—in the government, the military, and across different sectors of society? What comes next depends on factors like whether Delcy Rodríguez [Venezuela’s acting president] can ensure continuity for the Chavistas while at the same time becoming somewhat more lenient toward U.S. interests.

The second is how this strike is being received in the United States. There has been backlash from Congress. The Trump administration has framed it as a law enforcement operation, but lawmakers say they were bypassed and are questioning the legality of the operation. The key question is how this lands with a Trump support base that is, in principle, uninterested in foreign interventions.

And third, at the international level, it’s still unclear how other major powers are interpreting this—whether they oppose it or see an opportunity. For countries like Russia and China, the question is whether this represents the loss of an ally, a precedent that could be applied in their own spheres of influence. For China in particular, it would mean not recovering the billions of dollars it still has as credit with Venezuela.

This didn’t come out of nowhere. There were months of escalating tensions. How does this moment fit into the longer U.S.–Venezuela standoff? Were you surprised when Trump announced the U.S. captured Maduro?

When Trump took office, his administration was mostly focused on immigration. Marco Rubio struggled with Richard Grenell over whose voice would be more influential in the White House on Venezuela. For the first few months Grenell seemed to have the upper hand: There were prisoner exchanges, deportation flights, Chevron’s license was renewed. But in 2025, Rubio established himself as a key strategic adviser on Venezuela. There was a noticeable shift: military buildup in the Caribbean, harsher rhetoric and labeling organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, allegations tying Maduro to some of them.

That framing was used to justify strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels—at least 34 so far with over 110 confirmed fatalities—not only in the Caribbean, but also in the Pacific. When that didn’t produce cracks within Maduro’s administration, we saw an escalation: oil tankers seized or chased, and a blockade on Venezuelan oil. That caused much more damage to the Maduro government’s ability to keep revenues afloat, yet there were still no cracks in Maduro’s network of alliances. So Trump was left with two options: either back down and strike some kind of deal or escalate. There had already been a CIA strike in late December, but I did not expect an operation of this kind.

The U.N. has already said this violates international law. Is there any real ambiguity here?

I’m not an expert on international law, but it’s my understanding that the U.S. does have the right to try someone in the United States for crimes that may have affected the U.S., such as drug trafficking. Thousands of drug traffickers have gone through this process. But I’m much less sure that this means the U.S. has the authority to go and extract Maduro from another country. Usually, the United States would request the extradition of a person believed to have committed a crime in the U.S. I’d say there are serious deficiencies in the legality of the operation.

The closest precedent, at least in Latin America, is the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, to capture and extract President Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. That operation was on a much larger scale and far more costly in terms of lives, duration, and scope. But it occurred in the context of the Cold War—a moment in history that preceded the era of multilateralism, international governance, and the development of international human rights norms. I’m concerned, seeing a return of this practice in 2026. It suggests much of what was built after that period is now unraveling, or being dismantled by the United States.

So what does the future of Venezuela look like? Rodríguez seems to be in control. Rubio is saying that she’s illegitimate. Do you see regime change on the horizon? Not in the short term, unless Rodríguez is unable to do two things. She needs to avoid taking a confrontational stance toward the United States, and instead strike deals and make concessions in the oil sector. Simultaneously, she needs to project an image of someone who remains loyal to Chavismo principles—respect for national sovereignty, resistance to excessive U.S. imperial practices, and so on. If she manages this balancing act, avoiding further U.S. strikes while preventing fractures within the Chavista ranks—both in the military and in social networks—Venezuela can stabilize in the short term. But if either of these fails, I think more violence is likely.

The United States has declared they intend to run the country. How will that complicate Rodríguez’s ability to stabilize Venezuela?

The U.S. is looking to ensure that this removal leads to more functional agreements with the Venezuelan government—guaranteeing U.S. companies can get in more freely, invest, settle, and sell all the oil they can pump. A full-fledged regime change does not seem to be the main goal of the Trump administration in the short term. They are aware that the [Venezuelan, anti-Maduro] opposition may have popular support, but they do not have the buy-in of the military in particular. Installing a government without military support would carry the risk of throwing the country into chaos.

Is there something about the way that the Venezuelan government is set up that will make it particularly challenging for Rodríguez to consolidate?

Like all governments and political forces, the Maduro government—the Chavistas—has its own internal currents and branches. Maduro, and particularly Cilia Flores, are relevant here. Their removal matters because Maduro and Cilia Flores had managed to pacify the different factions within Chavismo and build a system in which elites could extract wealth from Venezuela.

For example, the military benefited from revenues from the gold-mining sector. The security sector, some would say, participated in illegal drug trafficking, and of course benefited from oil and shipping. There was a balance, and wealth was distributed among military, economic, and political elites in a way that kept the system stable. Rodríguez may try to replicate this, but she will be dealing with a very different level of U.S. pressure than Maduro faced. There may also be Maduro loyalists who obstruct her government. So even if the overall architecture remains in place, simply replacing the person at the top will have repercussions across the entire government.

What role does oil actually play in all of this? I look at a country like Saudi Arabia and think, Wow, they got lucky they have so much oil. Why was this not necessarily possible for a place like Venezuela?

The key difference between Maduro and Chávez is that Maduro politicized the oil sector too heavily. When Chávez was in power, Venezuela benefited from a boom in energy prices in the mid-2000s. He also appointed people with technical expertise to manage the oil sector. When Maduro came to power in 2013, in a quest to consolidate his authority, he replaced almost all the Chavistas he didn’t trust—including the minister of oil—and replaced them with loyalists who lacked knowledge of the sector. That lack of understanding began to create problems with maintenance, delays, production failures, and so on.

Then you had the plummeting of oil prices about 10 years ago, which hurt Venezuela’s revenue. Even before the U.S. sanctioned the oil sector in 2019, under the first Trump administration, the sector was already collapsing due to corruption and overall mismanagement. They could still maintain significant production—almost a million barrels a day—but that was down from 3 million about 15 years earlier. With that, they had enough money to sustain the elites, but the rest of society and the broader economy collapsed. That’s why you had around 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country, as the government itself remained intact.

Up until last week, Nicolas Maduro was challenging the United States to invade, publishing videos of his military conducting drills. I know a little bit about his background, that he was originally a bus driver. What can you tell me about his character?

The role of Cilia Flores [Maduro’s wife, who was also arrested] is often overlooked. Some people refer to her as the power in the shadows, operating behind the scenes. Maduro did not reach his position alone. Flores was a key figure in liaising with the different branches of the Chavismo project. She has been head of the National Assembly, a deputy, and a minister. Her political trajectory was similar to Maduro’s, even though it was Maduro who was appointed by Chávez as his political heir. Maduro relied heavily on Cilia Flores, who played a key role in holding his government together.

Maduro also made use of humor and self-parody as a political tactic. He presents himself as a funny, silly, good guy. He even created a cartoon version of himself called “Súper Bigote,” or “Super Mustache.” I can’t think of another leader who has leaned so heavily into laughing at himself. He uses that strategy to conceal the authoritarian nature of his government, to soften accusations of massive human rights violations, suppression of dissent, waves of political arrests, extrajudicial killings, and so on.

And then you see the images of him being detained in the United States. He has a big grin, giving two thumbs up. What explains that?

There was also an attempt to keep the character going, to play on the empathy of the audience, watching a guy who, in another context, might greet you with a thumbs-up and say “Happy New Year.” He appears certain of his innocence, as though he believes he will be released once the truth comes out. While the aim of the United States might have been to show that a man who had been in power since 2013—so for over a decade—who had seemed untouchable was being brought down to the level of a common criminal.

I haven’t seen much from inside Venezuela. How are Venezuelans reacting inside the country?

At ACLED, we have so far recorded only two protests inside Venezuela, and both were in favor of Maduro. It’s not only that there are no protests, there has also been a decrease in traffic and economic activity over the past couple of days. Inside the country, the government has imposed a state of emergency and deployed military forces to the streets, which has disincentivized mobilization. Uncertainty is also playing a key role. There have been mixed messages coming from the United States—the sidelining of María Corina Machado [prominent opposition leader and recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize], the attempt to reach an agreement with Rodríguez, who is part of the same system as Maduro, and the broader fear that if this doesn’t work out, it could trigger chaos within the Chavista ranks and lead to violence. So I think people are avoiding the public sphere.

And what about abroad? How are Venezuelans in the diaspora reacting to this?

The vast majority of Venezuelans abroad have celebrated Maduro’s removal from power, though not as many agree with the way it happened through the bombing of Caracas. Most Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years did so either because of political persecution or because of the economic collapse caused by the Maduro administration.

It’s strange to see people celebrating the bombing of their own country.

It is. But it’s a testament to the level of discontent and anger toward an administration that has effectively dismantled the country’s economy. Twenty years ago, Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America. Today, roughly a quarter of the population has been forced to leave because the economy collapsed. The relief—if not outright celebration—among many Venezuelans reflects that deep discontent with the Maduro administration.

How are other leaders and peoples in Latin America reacting to this?

There has been a mixed reaction. Leftist governments like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have strongly condemned the U.S. action. On the other hand, more right-wing governments like Argentina, Ecuador, and the newly elected president of Honduras have been more supportive, and in some cases even enthusiastic about the operation. The divisions have been quite clear along ideological lines.

For people particularly in countries that have been most affected by the influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees—Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile—the arrival of Venezuelans has strained public resources, and in some cases it has been instrumentalized by xenophobic political figures, creating a stigma.

Maduro is widely perceived as the main cause of Venezuelan migration and is deeply unpopular. There was polling showing that, across Latin America, and particularly in the countries most affected by Venezuelan migration, many people were already in favor of major intervention in Venezuela, even before this happened.

The U.S. seems to be configuring the reasoning for capturing Maduro in real time, offering conflicting information. What do you think is really driving the U.S. here, and what’s bullshit?

There are three reasons. First, reasserting U.S. dominance in the hemisphere, especially actors seen as being in cahoots with the U.S.’s main global competitors, Russia and China. Second, widening U.S. access to energy and other resources. Venezuela is rich in gas, minerals, and gold, and expanding U.S. access to those sectors is strategically important for the American economy. Third is migration. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans live in the United States, and millions more across the region. By removing what is perceived to be the country’s main problem—Maduro—and projecting the image that the U.S. will now invest in Venezuela, the administration is trying to create a picture that things have improved and encourage Venezuelans living in the U.S. without legal status to return.

The BS part is drug trafficking, which is paradoxically the legal rationale being used to bring Maduro to justice. He’s being charged with drug trafficking, terrorism, and weapons offenses. But the narrative that Maduro himself is a central drug-trafficking threat—and that attacks on drug vessels or even Maduro’s trial will significantly reduce the flow of drugs to the U.S. or elsewhere—doesn’t really hold up.

This is a return to a more assertive U.S. approach toward Latin America. It’s something that had waned over the years and been replaced by a greater emphasis on regional cooperation through institutions like the Organization of American States, and by U.S. soft power projected through development projects. This attack marks a clear end to that era and a return to one in which the United States is willing to use its full power—economic, diplomatic, and military—to ensure that its preferences materialize in the region. It’s somewhat anachronistic, but it’s a renewed version of the Monroe Doctrine, which held that the U.S. has a responsibility to influence and direct political, economic, and military developments in the hemisphere, and to keep external forces from undermining its interests.

Does the speed at which Donald Trump pivoted to Greenland and Mexico reveal anything about how he might be thinking about Venezuela?

Trump may feel emboldened because it has cost the United States little in terms of human lives and equipment, which he emphasized repeatedly during his press conference on Saturday. Let’s see what the U.N. Security Council says and what comes next, but for now the international cost also appears limited. Whether more action happens in the immediate future will depend on how the situation in Venezuela unfolds. If it triggers domestic turmoil, violence between different factions of Chavismo, or broader social unrest, then it becomes less likely that this approach would be applied elsewhere. Paradoxically, if it works, there is a risk that it could be repeated in other contexts.

For those hoping that Gen Z would usher in a new era of progressive politics in America, the past two years have been a whipsaw. In 2024 there was great panic over young voters’ drift toward Donald Trump. But in 2025, after young voters in New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia helped deliver Democratic wins, there was a reassessment. In light of these liberal victories, many put forward amended evaluations, stating that Gen Z is both more participatory and progressive than it has been given credit for, and that concerns about Democratic erosion among young men, spurred by the influence of the “manosphere,” have been exaggerated. In fact, Gen Z was lauded for being the most progressive generation ever based on recent measures of racial attitudes from the 2024 Cooperative Election Study dataset, a nationally representative survey of over 60,000 Americans.

So which is it? Is Gen Z a bastion of progressives who are immune to the manosphere’s toxicity? Or is 2025 a blip, and is Gen Z bucking the long-running trend of younger generations moving left?

The short answer is that it’s complicated, and neither of those dueling narratives gets to the truth.

The slightly longer answer is this: According to the best available data, on issues of race, members of Gen Z are, on average, far more progressive than any of their older counterparts. But when it comes to attitudes toward gender, Gen Z members are no more progressive than the rest of us.

It’s a sobering finding with large-scale implications, both for the future of U.S. politics and for our understanding of how the first generation to grow up online is processing the modern media ecosystem.

It’s also particularly telling about the manosphere— a corner of the digital landscape that features communities dedicated to men’s issues ranging from things like self-help, dating, and fitness to explicitly misogynistic forums defined by grievances toward feminism and women. Although the manosphere content often cited by media and scholars is not necessarily racially regressive, it is distinctly gender regressive, and that appears to be taking a toll on Gen Z.

OK, those are big claims. So how do I know this? I’m an academic whose work has focused explicitly on the importance of identity in American politics—things like race, gender, and class—and how we can use surveys to understand its influence. I’m going off not just vibes here; my conclusions are based on that same 2024 survey, which, as noted, drew from more than 60,000 Americans.

Among questions in which the survey asks how much one agrees or disagrees with statements like “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class” and “Whites get away with offenses that African Americans would never get away with,” members of Gen Z are unique. Of all age groups, they show the lowest levels of what scholars call racial resentment, a standard survey index that combines multiple questions to measure racism. However, on measures of ambivalent sexism, via statements such as “Women seek to gain power by getting control over men” and “Women are too easily offended,” Gen Z–ers are strikingly no different from their grandparents. Let’s break it down.

The figure above shows that Gen Z’s level of sexism is only slightly below average, and negligibly lower than the Silent Generation’s. Sexism is measured using respondents’ level of agreement with two statements, mentioned earlier, about women seeking power over men and being too easily offended. Generational scores are then standardized so that they demonstrate how each generation compares with the overall average across all respondents in the CES. Values closer to “high” indicate groups that are more sexist than average, while values closer to “low” indicate groups that are less sexist than average.

This gender finding stands in sharp contrast to racial attitudes. Racial resentment is measured using five survey items about structural racial inequality and is also depicted relative to the overall average. On race, each older generation consistently displays higher resentment compared with the generation that succeeded it. Gen Z is notably lower than average on racial resentment.

The takeaway is not that Gen Z–ers are uniformly progressive, but that their progressivism is uneven. It is real and pronounced based on race but far more tenuous when it comes to gender.

Gen Z’s lack of progress on gender issues is all the more stark when you break down the differences in responses across genders.

One can look at how men and women across age differ in levels of racism and sexism. The first figure shows that younger generations are slightly less sexist than older generations (though this data is in no way as stark as that of racism). However, if you look at this by men and women in different generations, this slightly lower level of sexism is driven entirely by women in those generations. Men across each age group are above average in their level of sexism, and there is no generational difference in level of gender progressiveness.

These trends, unsurprisingly, differ by political party identification. Republicans exhibit the highest level of both sexism and racial resentment for all age cohorts. Interestingly, younger Republicans are actually more sexist than their elders, suggesting a potential regression in attitudes toward women across generations. This further lends support to the narrative that young people on the right are being influenced by sexist content online. Overall, Democrats and independents show rising racial progressiveness across age—but no similar generational shift on sexism.

If the narrative that Gen Z is uniquely progressive were true, we would expect Gen Z–ers to be more progressive than older generations by outright rejecting sexist statements. Older cohorts tend to hover around mild tolerance, so a genuinely more progressive generation (Gen Z Democrats included) should move decisively beyond that baseline. It doesn’t.

It is easier and more comfortable to conclude that Gen Z is pretty great and to advise people to stop panicking—to embrace a comforting narrative that the youth are here to save us. It is also reasonable to applaud reductions in racism that have taken shape over generations.

But dwelling too long on that can foster misplaced faith and ill-timed complacency.

The data reveals that concerns over young people, especially young men, are not unfounded. Gender-focused research supports the lived experience of what women already know: There is a rising tide of gender-based antagonism both online and offline. It does us no favors to conflate the important gains in racial progress among Gen Z with the real evidence of the impact of the manosphere and red-pill communities.

Beyond the findings presented here, research from scholars like Michael Tesler, John Sides, and Colette Marcellin, as well as from Melissa Deckman, supports this broader pattern of gender attitudes. According to their work, young Republicans, men and women alike, are gravitating toward traditional gender roles, and young men overall are becoming more conservative. This shows that gender attitudes broadly are an effective terrain for Republican appeals. Gender attitudes may be a bridge issue that allows the GOP to find new voters without conceding ground on other issues.

Young Republicans, the ones who are more sexist than their grandparents, are increasingly setting the tone and strategy for their party. And this new cohort has focused on reaching young voters in the media environments they already inhabit with campaign strategies that focus on entertainment-forward social media and generationally relatable messages.

In practice, this looks like using masculinity-based appeals to reach young voters, particularly in spaces that sit outside the conventional conservative-media ecosystem. From an attitudinal perspective, this strategy may be well suited to the moment. The lack of clear progress of Gen Z on gender attitudes leaves an opening in which appeals grounded in masculinity and skepticism toward feminism can resonate without triggering partisan backlash. If Republicans continue to organize their outreach around this dimension, the strategy may prove durable over time.

Over the next few decades, these attitudes toward both racism and sexism will shape not just elections, the focus of current commentary, but institutions and policy. A generation that is progressive on race but not on gender will not be able to implement a fully egalitarian society. There will be uneven progress, with movement forward on issues of racial inequality but stagnation and resistance toward inroads into gender inequality. This will manifest across institutions, producing a political world that can accommodate racial inclusion while continuing to normalize unequal gender relations in families, workplaces, and governance.

President Donald Trump’s military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is flatly illegal under international law and almost certainly illegal under federal law—an unauthorized use of force against a foreign nation that pushes executive power past its breaking point. Yet there is no real chance that the courts will curb it, even as the mission evolves into a possible occupation of Venezuela and an expansion of hostilities to its neighbors. Nor is there any signal that Congress will impose restraints on what appears to be the dawn of a new conflict overseas, surrendering its constitutional war powers to Trump without objection. And even if Congress does try to assert its authority to oversee (or end) military action in South America, it will face an uphill battle in a judiciary that persistently favors the commander in chief.

This inversion of our constitutional order sets a perilous precedent that even many celebrating Maduro’s fall may come to regret. It marks the death knell of the post–World War II settlement that, however imperfect, wrestled the anarchy of war into a framework designed to condition armed aggression on legal justification. The executive branch’s consolidation of power now reverberates far beyond the United States’ shores as a saber-rattling president abandons any pretense that the law can constrain his resort to military force. Indeed, the legal theories the administration has floated to defend its actions draw on a historical source Trump once disavowed: the arch-interventionist claim that the U.S. has an inalienable right to police the world.

It is difficult to tally all the ways in which the Maduro operation was illegal, but start with a point that few dispute: This act violated international law. Trump’s invasion of Venezuela to capture its president cannot be squared with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which bars member nations from deploying “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” This principle—the most important rule of international law today—should bind the United States, which ratified the charter in 1945. And it clearly prohibits the American government from invading another country to make an arrest.

Yet Mike Waltz, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, did not even pretend that the administration complied with Article 2(4) in his address to the U.N. Security Council on Monday. Instead, Waltz rejected the premise that this rule should apply to Venezuela at all, because Maduro was an “illegitimate narco-terrorist” and “fugitive from justice.” Of course, if a country can disregard the U.N. Charter whenever it concludes that another nation’s leaders have given up their claim to “territorial integrity or political independence,” then the charter means nothing. Arguably worse was Waltz’s insistence that Venezuela’s vast “energy reserves” also justified the action, a motive Trump has laid bare from the start. It should go without saying that the charter does not, under any circumstances, permit one nation to invade another to secure control over its natural resources.

So what is the government’s legal defense of its military incursion into Venezuela? The administration purports to be following the Panama precedent of 1989—when President George H.W. Bush ordered the military invasion of Panama to arrest its dictator, Manuel Noriega, ostensibly so he could stand trial in the U.S. But this episode was not approved by Congress (which found out just hours before) or the U.N. (which condemned it) or a federal court (which never passed on its legality). Instead, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel justified the aggression in a secret memo signed by William Barr, who would go on to serve as attorney general for the first Bush and Trump.

In that memo, Barr claimed that the president has inherent constitutional authority to conduct extraterritorial arrests for violations of U.S. law. Even if those arrests require complex military incursions into foreign nations, he wrote, they remain within the president’s inherent powers and do not require congressional approval. Barr further asserted that these arrests did not have to comply with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. That provision, he wrote, does not actually bind the executive branch because it is not “self-executing,” freeing the commander in chief to disregard it.

This conclusion was obviously wrong: Even if the charter cannot be enforced by federal courts, it remains binding on the executive branch and is a law that the president has a constitutional duty to faithfully execute. The memo was so absurd, in fact, that the DOJ did everything in its power to conceal it, as New York University law professor Ryan Goodman has documented. After Congress demanded to see Barr’s memo, the department refused, even failing to comply with a subpoena ordering its disclosure. When Barr eventually testified about its contents under oath, he omitted its assertion that the president can “override” the U.N. Charter (a legal justification that made up a mere four paragraphs). The Clinton administration finally released the memo in 1993, and in the years since, legal experts have derided it as “deeply counterintuitive and indefensible,” “fundamentally flawed,” “preposterous,” and utterly “bereft of citation to supporting authority.”

But embrace, for a moment, the nihilism of Barr’s memo and assume that international law imposes no legitimate constraints on the president’s use of force. Even then, Trump’s actions in Venezuela would still be illegal—or, most generously, an egregious distortion of the constitutional war powers. It is Congress, after all, that has the authority to declare war and must authorize use of military force. The president is the commander in chief, the civilian leader of the armed forces, but he holds no independent power to commence hostilities. Needless to say, Congress has neither declared war on Venezuela nor authorized military force within its borders.

From where, then, did Trump derive authority to invade Venezuela? As Harvard Law professor Jack Goldsmith has explained, the administration evidently contrived it from its desire to arrest Maduro on federal charges. The logic goes like this: The DOJ sought to take the dictator into custody on charges of drug trafficking. It could do so only by storming Venezuela. That operation would require protection from the military. And as a matter of “unit self-defense,” these accompanying troops had a right to bomb, shoot, and otherwise overwhelm any threats to the mission through lethal force. This rationale is quintessential bootstrapping: The alleged goal of trying Maduro in the U.S. gives Trump permission to launch a hostile incursion into a sovereign nation, whose ramifications may well give rise to a broader regional conflict.

Georgetown Law professor and Slate contributor Steve Vladeck has laid out the danger of this shameless maneuver: It subverts the constitutional order by allowing the president to set off offensive military operations under the pretext of carrying out an arrest warrant on foreign soil. If troops face any resistance, they can escalate with further use of force, sliding quickly toward war—all without authorization from the legislative branch. So the Trump administration’s apparent rationale is less of a loophole than a complete end run around Congress’ war powers with no limiting principle in sight.

Despite all this, no one seriously thinks that any federal court will slow or stop Trump’s attacks in Venezuela and its neighbors. Americans seem to have consigned ourselves to the reality that legal constraints on the commander in chief’s operational decisions are entirely theoretical, with no meaningful mechanism for enforcement. Congress has handed over to the president more and more of its authority over foreign affairs. The Supreme Court has persistently forbidden federal judges from second-guessing the executive branch’s use of military force. (That’s why the Trump administration’s legal defense comes not from a court decision but from a self-serving opinion produced by the Department of Justice.) And the rest of the world has no means to secure accountability for the United States, which does not even recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

So Trump, already a “unitary executive” at home, becomes a kind of ersatz emperor abroad, bound by no law of nations, no treaty or charter, no checks but those he elects to honor. The post–World War II consensus, as enshrined in the U.N. Charter, rejected this kind of unbridled aggression as an invitation to perpetual conflict. Trump, in turn, rejects that consensus. It may be tempting to ignore the consequences of this radical new doctrine when it is wielded against an illegitimate dictator like Maduro. But Trump is already threatening action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and even Mexico, a liberal democracy with a legitimately elected president. The end point, it seems, is whatever this president says it is. That theory of American dominance does not merely push legal limits. It subordinates law to the logic of conquest.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last fall, Jakub Ciolek reported two denial-of-service bugs in Argo CD, a popular Kubernetes controller, via HackerOne&#39;s Internet Bug Bounty (IBB) program. Both were assigned CVEs and have since been fixed. But instead of receiving an $8,500 reward for the two flaws, Ciolek says, HackerOne ghosted him for months.

The open source bug bounty program finally contacted Ciolek on Tuesday, but only after The Register reached out to HackerOne asking about the status of his reward payment and the IBB program in general.

HackerOne&#39;s IBB is a crowdfunded bug bounty program that encourages researchers and maintainers to find and fix vulnerabilities in open source software by offering pooled cash payouts. Any organization that relies on open source code to run its technology or chains (in other words: everyone) can contribute to the bounty pool.

Once CVE-tracked vulnerabilities are fixed, the program deducts the funds automatically and issues rewards, with 80 percent of the bounty going to the hacker who reported the bug, and 20 percent to the open source project to help fund the fix.

That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to work, anyway.

When researchers are instead met with silence - even after CVEs are issued and fixes are shipped - it undermines confidence in the entire model

&quot;When researchers are instead met with silence - even after CVEs are issued and fixes are shipped - it undermines confidence in the entire model,&quot; Ciolek told The Register. &quot;A simple notice saying &#39;the program is inactive&#39; would go a long way. Ghosting researchers does the opposite.&quot;

The two high-severity denial-of-service flaws, CVE-2025-59538 and CVE-2025-59531, affect Argo CD, a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. If exploited, these issues could allow a remote attacker to crash vulnerable instances without any authentication.

The open source project&#39;s maintainers fixed both vulnerabilities in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19, released on September 30, and credited Ciolek with reporting the flaws.

Since October, Ciolek said he tried multiple times to reach someone at HackerOne to find out when and if he&#39;ll get a payout, or if the IBB program has been paused, despite still being listed as active on the website. All of these inquiries were met with radio silence, according to Ciolek. He&#39;s not some noob either – he&#39;s got some 20 bug disclosures under his belt and earned two payouts from this bounty program last year.

&quot;I submitted the reports to HackerOne on October 30, 2025, as required by the IBB process,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;Since then, I&#39;ve repeatedly tried to get confirmation or an update from HackerOne.&quot;

This includes sending messages via the platform on November 14, November 19, and December 15, he said. He also emailed the official IBB address (ibb@hackerone.com) on December 15, and reached out to an employee on December 22.

&quot;None of these attempts received a response,&quot; Ciolek said. &quot;According to HackerOne&#39;s own IBB page, the last resolved report appears to be from roughly eight months ago.&quot;

On Tuesday, however, he did receive an email from HackerOne thanking him for his patience, confirming the program remains active, and noting his bug reports remain &quot;pending reward processing due to a temporary operational backlog.&quot;

HackerOne told Ciolek it expects to resume its regularly scheduled rewards payout by the end of the first quarter or sooner.

The bug bounty platform did not respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries.

While it looks like Ciolek will receive a monetary award for his time and effort, the lack of communication to researchers still presents a problem.

&quot;Bug bounty programs run on trust and clarity,&quot; Ciolek said. &quot;If a program is paused, defunded, or otherwise inactive, that&#39;s completely understandable – but it needs to be communicated.&quot;

&quot;I want to stress that I don&#39;t do vulnerability research purely for money,&quot; he added. &quot;Most of my findings come without bounties attached. But bounties matter: they help offset the time spent auditing, documenting, and responsibly disclosing issues, and they make it easier for researchers to justify working on open-source projects that don&#39;t otherwise have funding.&quot;

Ciolek also wonders if AI slop is at least partly to blame.

&quot;I suspect platforms are also dealing with increased noise - including low-quality LLM-based or automated submissions,&quot; he said. &quot;But that makes responsiveness to valid, high-signal reports even more important, not less.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The data platform Snowflake is putting Google&#39;s Gemini to work inside its Cortex AI, aiming to give customers access to a foundational model within the boundaries of their data environment across supported clouds, the company told The Register.

Customers use Snowflake to store nearly any operational data, including financial records such as ERP data, CRM records including tickets and transactions, IoT and sensor data, API calls and responses, website user activity, and even content such as PDFs, document files, images, videos, and audio. Cortex AI allows users to pick the model of their choice, now including Gemini, to process that glacier of information using an LLM to get business insights.

“By running Gemini natively in Snowflake, customers can use Gemini models across all supported clouds via cross-region inference, regardless of whether their Snowflake environments run on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud,” Dwarak Rajagopal, VP of AI Engineering and Research at Snowflake, told The Register via email.

Snowflake’s phased rollout is part of its AI model-agnostic strategy, which he said should ensure customers can use best-in-class models across the Cortex stack without re-architecting data or workflows.

“Our philosophy is model choice without compromise – customers shouldn’t have to trade off innovation, governance, or simplicity to use the best models available,” Rajagopal said.

Cortex AI already supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, Meta, and Mistral. With Cortex AI, users can access those models directly in SQL or via APIs, analyze multimodal data, and then build AI use cases.

While the company is not disclosing pricing, it&#39;s apparently consistent with Snowflake’s “broader consumption model,” Rajagopal said.

“Customers only pay for what they actually use, which lowers risk, encourages innovation, and makes it easier to move AI from experimentation into production with confidence,” he said, adding that Snowflake wants customers to get to work inside the platform “to start small, experiment freely and scale AI usage based on real value” rather than sunk costs.

Snowflake customers can begin using a public preview of Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash through Cortex AI Functions as of Tuesday. Support is coming soon for Snowflake Intelligence and Snowflake Cortex Agents, which customers use to build AI agents that tap into company data. ®

            <h2>Brave refurbishes Rust adblocking engine for reduced memory footprint</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/brave_refurbishes_rust_adblocking_engine/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Brave Software has reworked its browser&#39;s Rust-based adblock engine to make it significantly more memory efficient and perhaps more secure. So you get fewer ads now with fewer MB of RAM.

According to Shivan Kaul Sahib, VP of privacy and security for Brave, company software engineers have been able to reduce memory consumption by around 75 percent since the reengineering began last year.

&quot;The upgrade represents roughly 45 MB of memory savings for the Brave browser on every platform (Android, iOS and desktop) by default, and scales even higher for users with additional adblocking lists enabled,&quot; said Sahib in a blog post.

The benefits of reduced memory consumption include improved battery life and smoother multitasking, while also leaving more memory for other applications.

Brave&#39;s initial refactoring effort, as of June 2025, saw the memory footprint shrink from 150 MB to 121 MB. By October 2025, memory usage went from 119 MB to 108 MB. Presently, Brave puts its browser&#39;s memory footprint at 104 MB in version 1.85.118, down from 162 MB in version 1.79.118, released May 2025.

When The Register examined Brave version 1.85.118 under macOS Tahoe (26.1), the browser memory footprint upon reinstallation showed 121 MB in the built-in Task Manager. After fiddling with settings to ensure the browser&#39;s Leo AI assistant was completely disabled and restarting, the footprint dropped to 106 MB.

We note, however, that Brave&#39;s own screenshot shows an increase in the memory footprint of the GPU process, from 52.2 MB to 81.9 MB between the two versions being compared.

&quot;That is unrelated to the adblock engine memory improvements,&quot; Sahib told The Register in an email. &quot;Such fluctuations in browser resource consumption across browser runs are extremely common; even the screenshot doesn&#39;t show exactly 45 MB of memory reduction, it actually shows a bigger decrease!

&quot;Performance measurement is heavily dependent on statistical averaging across multiple runs (which is what our improvement numbers indicate) and we don&#39;t have any evidence of a GPU footprint regression internally.&quot;

Brave has been able to eke out greater memory efficiency by incorporating FlatBuffers, a cross-platform serialization library initially created by Google for game development. It allows access to serialized data without unpacking or parsing – extra steps that add overhead.

&quot;This architectural transition allowed us to move the roughly 100,000 adblock filters shipped by default from standard, heap-allocated Rust data structures (such as Vecs, HashMaps, and structs) into a specialized, zero-copy binary format,&quot; explained Sahib in his post.

Company engineers have also been integrating other improvements like stack-allocated vectors for better memory management, tokenizing common regex patterns for better filter matching performance, resource sharing among adblock engines, and optimized resource memory storage.

Sahib said Brave&#39;s adblock-engine has led to better performance and battery life on mobile devices, pointing to a series of related blog posts.

&quot;The upshot is that blocking ads and trackers significantly improves user experience around page loading since fewer resources have to be downloaded,&quot; he said. &quot;Brave has also built BatteryLab Device Evaluations for browser performance measurement across mobile devices.&quot;

Beyond the performance improvements, Rust has helped make Brave more secure.

&quot;Rust makes entire classes of security and reliability bugs impossible,&quot; said Sahib. &quot;Chromium (and so Brave) follows a Rule of Two for safely handling untrusted input from the Internet, and using a memory-safe language like Rust (for adblocking, or QR code generation) is a great way to increase trust in the safety of the browser.&quot;

Brave is not alone in its affinity for Rust code, popular these days because it manages to perform well while offering memory safety guarantees. Mozilla, where Rust was created, has implemented Rust code in Firefox and more so in its browser engine spin-off project Servo. Google is supporting the use of Rust in Chromium. And Microsoft is applying Rust more broadly.

Brave is also working on a variation of its browser called Brave Origin. It will require a one-time fee (but not on Linux) in exchange for the absence of sponsored images, Brave Rewards, Brave Wallet, Brave VPN, Leo, and telemetry. Security updates will be offered.

Sahib said Brave isn&#39;t yet ready to share a release date for Brave Origin. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/boston_dynamics_atlas_production/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 Remember when Elon Musk predicted that there would be thousands of Optimus robots at Tesla factories by the end of 2025? Well, that didn&#39;t happen, but competitor Boston Dynamics has just announced that its humanoid robot, Atlas, is going to the big time.

Not only is Boston Dynamics beginning commercial production of the final version of Atlas, but it&#39;s also solidified plans to deploy tens of thousands of Atlas units at Hyundai Motor Group manufacturing facilities. Hyundai, Boston Dynamics&#39; majority shareholder, will start with deployment of Atlas at its Robot Metaplant Application Center in the coming months. Boston Dynamics noted that Hyundai&#39;s $26 billion investment in US manufacturing announced last year will also include a robotics factory able to produce 30,000 bots a year, many of which will presumably be Atlas units based on its context in the Atlas press material.

In addition to its planned Hyundai deployments this year, Boston Dynamics also announced a partnership with Google DeepMind at CES that will see the pair working out how to integrate Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas to, according to Boston Dynamics, &quot;give the robot greater cognitive capabilities.&quot;

Those two commitments mean that all the Atlas units slated for production this year are spoken for, but Boston Dynamics noted it&#39;s planning to add additional customers in early 2027. We asked if Boston Dynamics had any customers lined up for 2027, but it declined to name any.

We&#39;ve known the all-electric, commercial version of Atlas was coming since 2024, when Boston Dynamics retired the old version in favor of a prototype that looks generally like what the robotics leader unveiled at CES this week.

Speaking of 2024, Boston Dynamics seemed to take direct aim at some other humanoid robot manufacturers when it cited its late entry into the game.

&quot;Boston Dynamics only announced its intention to build a commercial humanoid in 2024, after it became clear that recent AI advances had accelerated the pace of how robots could be trained and deployed into real-world applications,&quot; the company said in a press release.

You may recall Tesla AI Day 2021, when Elon Musk embarrassingly trotted out a guy in a morph suit to demonstrate his dream of humanoid robots able to serve as replacements for human labor. By the following year, Optimus hadn&#39;t advanced all that much. Fast-forward to 2025, and Musk was predicting Optimus version 3 prototyped by the end of the year.

Not only did that not happen, but Musk&#39;s claim Tesla would produce 5,000 to 10,000 Optimus robots in 2025 butted up hard against the embarrassing reality that Optimus isn&#39;t only behind the curve, but likely doesn&#39;t have any autonomous capabilities at all.

Atlas, on the other hand, is now in production and has software that allows it to not only be tele-operated via VR or controlled by a tablet, but also lets it function autonomously.

&quot;Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children – useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling,&quot; Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said of the Atlas production launch.

The robot has two batteries that it&#39;s able to hot-swap on its own, it&#39;s able to operate in temperatures as low as -4° F to as hot as 104° F (-20° C to 40° C), is IP67 rated, has 56 degrees of freedom, is padded and has minimal pinch points to reduce the risk of injury to humans operating in the same space as it, and was designed with simple components that can be swapped out for field repairs with minimal time and effort.

Atlas is supposedly able to learn autonomously from its environment, and can push its newfound knowledge to other Atlas units in a company&#39;s fleet. Atlas also has 360-degree vision to help it spot people before they get too close to its working space, and is designed to pause whenever it could put a person in danger, then continue its work once they&#39;re clear.

As to it making a leap forward in humanoid robotics with this announcement, Boston Dynamics told us we shouldn&#39;t be surprised.

&quot;Over a decade ago, we were one of the only companies on the planet putting real R&D into humanoid robots. Now it seems like every week a new company pops up with big plans to make humanoids,&quot; a company spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We don’t take it lightly, and if we were going to make a commercial humanoid, we had to be convinced we have a solid plan not only to build something cool, but to build something useful.&quot;

The hydraulic version of Atlas that the company retired in 2024 had been under development since 2013, and by the end of its run, was capable of doing some impressive stunts.

&quot;Our commercialization track record with Spot and Stretch gives us confidence that our commercialization with Atlas will be successful,&quot; the company added, noting that its customers are hungry for new Boston Dynamics robots &quot;because they know what to expect.&quot;

Tesla didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

&quot;We take the security of our networks and protection of our customers&#39; and employees&#39; information seriously and are rigorous in securing our networks and monitoring threats,&quot; Rodriguez Miller said.

On Sunday night, a cybercrime crew called Crimson Collective said in its Telegram channel that it had, &quot;in our hands,&quot; more than one million residential users&#39; details including: customer/account master records containing names, emails, phone numbers, billing and service addresses; session and user IDs; payment history and methods linked to accounts including the last four digits of customers&#39; credit cards; order records and other information.

&quot;If anyone has someone working at Brightspeed, tell them to read their mails fast!&quot; the post seen by The Register said.

A day later, the crims published samples of the allegedly stolen files on the same channel.

While they wouldn&#39;t say how they gained access to the broadband provider&#39;s systems, a Crimson Collective spokesperson told The Register that it was a &quot;sophisticated attack&quot; that also allowed them to disconnect every user from service.

We can&#39;t verify this claim, so take it for what it is.

The spokesperson also claimed that Brightspeed&#39;s security team ignored the group&#39;s emails sent before the breach was disclosed, and that the crew has since set a sale price of three bitcoin. If no one is interested in buying the dataset, Crimson Collective plans to dump all of the information online in a week.

Crimson Collective is a newish extortion crew that claimed to have broken into Red Hat&#39;s private GitLab repositories in the fall, exfiltrating about 570 GB of compressed data, some of which Nissan later said affected around 21,000 of its customers.

Shortly after Red Hat confirmed the intrusion, Crimson Collective announced it had teamed up with the ShinyHunters-linked Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters collective to extort the IBM-owned biz. ®

Updated: Following publication, Crimson Collective amended their claims to clarify they disconnected users from ISP coverage, not mobile coverage.

            <div id="article-text">Not even Legos are safe from the inexorable march of smart technology, as the Danish construction toy stalwart introduced a new tech-in-a-brick Smart Play system at CES this week.

Lego brick sets based around Smart Bricks will be packed with things like light and motion sensors, a speaker, lights, a wirelessly rechargeable battery and other components. According to Lego, that means builds that include a four-by-two Smart Brick are able to &quot;react uniquely depending on how it&#39;s moved, twisted, and turned.&quot;

&quot;You might hear our SMART Brick roaring like a jet plane or flushing like a toilet,&quot; Lego explained in a rundown of how the system could work.

There&#39;s a catch, though: Smart Bricks don&#39;t do a darn thing unless they&#39;re placed close to an accompanying Smart Minifigure or flat 2-by-2 sized Smart Tag, both of which appear, based on an image shared by Lego, to have some form of NFC chip in them.

Lego explained that it chose to design its own internal hardware for the Smart Play system instead of relying on an existing design, resulting in a &quot;bespoke, silicon ASIC chip&quot; for Smart Play that is &quot;smaller than just one standard Lego stud and highly specialized to the task.&quot;

As explained in Lego&#39;s blog posts, tags can do things like tell a Smart Brick that it&#39;s now part of an aircraft, boat, or other vehicle, or that it&#39;s attached to the back of a dinosaur or animal. They&#39;re also embedding the chips into Smart Minifigures, which are like the standard Lego people and characters, but programmed with their own personalities.

&quot;Each Smart Minifigure reacts differently to the world around them,&quot; Lego explained, &quot;through their own sounds, moods and reactions, which are played back to you via the SMART Brick.&quot;

Put a nervous minifigure on a spaceship, and they might freak out, Lego said.

&quot;Every SMART Play Minifigure reacts uniquely to any given play scenario,&quot; the company added.

Of course, this being the modern era of Lego, a new product launch wouldn&#39;t be complete without licensing it out to a brand, and what Lego-licensed IP is more recognizable than Star Wars?

Sure, kids will eventually be able to build Smart Brick-enabled cars, airplanes, and dinosaurs. For now, however, they&#39;ll be exclusively able to play with Smart Legos in a galaxy far, far away.

Three Smart Play sets were announced at CES: Darth Vader&#39;s TIE Fighter, Luke Skywalker&#39;s X-Wing, and Emperor Palpatine&#39;s Throne Room, which also comes with an A-Wing. Smart tags in the trio of kits include the aforementioned craft, along with lightsaber duel sounds, an Imperial laser turret, transport ship, R2-D2, and the like. Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Emperor Palpatine, and Princess Leia Smart Minifigures all feature, too, naturally.

The sets will be available for preorder beginning January 9, and will start shipping in March.

Lego bricks with onboard custom ASICs seem like a builder&#39;s dream come true – especially with Lego&#39;s professed goal of encouraging open-ended play. Given that, it would seem natural for Lego to release some kind of development kit for the Smart Play system to enable advanced Lego lovers to design their own Smart Tags and Minifigures.

Alas, nothing like that has been announced so far.

For now, Lego is foregoing unlimited user creativity in favor of releasing Star Wars-branded sets – when I was a kid I had nothing but a bunch of random multi-colored bricks and the imagination to build my own starships, this aging Vulture screams while shaking his fist.

The only clue to the future of what DIY enthusiasts can expect from Lego Smart Play comes in the form of a cryptic statement at the end of a press release. &quot;LEGO SMART Play™ will continue to expand through new updates, launches and technology – with the LEGO Group set to reveal more additions in the future.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Some of Apple’s latest models, including the Apple Watch Series 11 and SE 3, are starting to see major discounts.

Some of Apple’s latest models, including the Apple Watch Series 11 and SE 3, are starting to see major discounts.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

In September, Apple launched its latest fleet of smartwatches, including the Apple Watch Series 11, the SE 3, and the Ultra 3. Each wearable offers something a little different (their prices indicate their breadth of features), and we’re already starting to see big price drops. Additionally, we’re still recommending some recent predecessors in Apple’s portfolio, including the Series 10 and Ultra 2, for which discounts are fairly common.

But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 26, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models. That means those still using a Series 5 or older — including the original Apple Watch SE — are getting left behind in terms of features.

The new Apple Watch Series 11 is a fairly iterative update of the Series 10, meaning those who already own Apple’s last-gen flagship may not necessarily feel compelled to upgrade. That being said, the newest model does tout a more power-efficient 5G modem and a more scratch-resistant display, as well as an additional 6 hours of battery life over the Series 10. It’s also the slimmest Apple Watch to date and the first to offer FDA-cleared hypertension notifications out of the gate, which you can also now leverage on the Series 9 and Ultra 2.

If you’re looking to be an early adopter, however, you can pick up the Apple Watch Series 11 in the 42mm configuration with GPS at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $299 ($100 off), which is its best price to date. If you prefer the larger 46mm / GPS model, it’s currently available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for an all-time low of $329 ($100 off).

If you’re looking for a real deal — and you’re not particularly tempted by what the Series 11 offers — the Series 10 still holds its own. The last-gen smartwatch packs the same S10 SiP chip that’s in the Series 11, as well as support for fast-charging, a gorgeous wide-angle OLED display, and a design that’s still significantly slimmer and lighter than previous models. It also features both depth and water temperature sensors, along with an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature and the aforementioned hypertension notifications, courtesy of watchOS 26.

Thankfully, the Series 10 remains on sale at Walmart in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $249 ($150 off), while the larger 46mm GPS variant is available for an all-time low of $279 ($80 off) at Walmart.

While the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 introduce a handful of iterative updates, the new Apple Watch SE 3 represents a significant upgrade over its 2022 predecessor. The entry-level watch features the same speedy S10 chip found in Apple’s flagship models, for one, letting you take advantage of Apple’s double tap feature, wrist flick gestures, and on-device Siri. The SE 3 also (finally) adds an always-on display, 5G connectivity, support for fast-charging, and audio playback so you can listen to music or podcasts directly from your wrist.

On the health front, the SE 3 introduces a wrist-temperature sensor for retrospective ovulation tracking, along with breathing disturbance alerts, sleep apnea notifications, and a new Sleep Score that breaks down time spent in each stage. What you won’t find are the Series 11’s EKG functionality, blood oxygen monitoring, or hypertension notifications — those are exclusive to the Series and Ultra models.

In terms of deals, the Apple Watch Series 3 is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in its 40mm base configuration with GPS for $219 ($30 off), which is about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the larger 44mm model at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $249 (also $30 off).

If you don’t need the latest upgrades, the last-gen SE remains a solid buy if you can pick it up at a significant discount. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which still holds up well, but has fewer sensors (meaning fewer features), no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to Apple’s newer watches. Those omissions might take it out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after.

Right now, the best deal on the last-gen SE can be found at Walmart, where you can pick up the 40mm model with GPS starting at $129 ($120 off), its best price to date. The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available at Walmart starting at $159 ($120 off), which remains an all-time low.

Unsurprisingly, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 offers the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch available thus far. It features a larger, wide-angle OLED display with a 1Hz refresh rate and thinner bezels, as well as both satellite and 5G connectivity. Better yet, battery life has been extended from 36 hours to 42 hours — a marginal improvement, but one that allows you to squeeze out a bit more life when necessary.

As far as deals are concerned, the Ultra 3 recently dropped to an all-time low of $699.99 ($100 off). That said, it’s currently only available at Amazon with either an Ocean Band, a Trail Loop, or an Alpine Loop starting at $779.99 (a mere $19 off).

If the latest Ultra isn’t what you’re after, you can save some money by opting for an Apple Watch Ultra 2, which isn’t vastly different than Apple’s latest top-of-the-line model. The wearable runs on the older S9 SiP and features Apple’s second-gen ultra wideband chip, but that may not matter to you since it still offers precise GPS tracking, a range of diving-friendly sensors, and long-lasting battery life.

Right now, you can pick up the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at Amazon with an Alpine Loop or a Trail Loop starting at $549 ($250 off), which is its best price to date. Alternatively, you can grab it with an Ocean Band at Best Buy for $599 ($200 off), which remains a sizable discount.

            <div id="article-text">Biden’s national security adviser tried to stop Nvidia from selling high-end chips to China. In a wide-ranging interview with The Verge, Sullivan predicts the consequences of Trump reversing that policy.

Biden’s national security adviser tried to stop Nvidia from selling high-end chips to China. In a wide-ranging interview with The Verge, Sullivan predicts the consequences of Trump reversing that policy.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about Big Tech, Big Government, and the big paradigm shifts that result from their collision. Not a subscriber yet? It’s a new year, so why not treat yourself?

In 2022, Jake Sullivan, then national security adviser under President Joe Biden and a powerful figure in the White House’s foreign policy team, assembled an interagency planning exercise out of the Situation Room: What were all the possible circumstances and outcomes of an AI arms race between the US and China — from trade wars to real wars, possibly even the arrival of AGI — and how would the federal government respond?

The details and results of that simulation are classified, but on Sunday, I spoke to Sullivan and asked if he could at least describe one outcome: Did they ever run a scenario where the AI industry’s profit interests were driving foreign policy instead of the government?

His candid response surprised me. “I confess that we did not factor in the possibility that we would actually be rolling back our export controls.”

Sullivan, now a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is definitively pro-artificial intelligence and pro-innovation. But he thinks about AI in a way that a former national security adviser would: as a means to gain a geopolitical advantage against adversaries like China. His decision at the time was to place tight controls on the high-end chips that American companies were allowed to sell to China, extending a policy that dates back to the Cold War: Don’t sell high-end tech to America’s foreign enemies. Despite extreme backlash from tech companies, Sullivan was confident his policies would remain in place once Biden left office, telling Bloomberg in a January 2025 interview that “by and large,” tech CEOs accepted the need for those export controls, and that he wasn’t worried about incoming President Donald Trump cutting deals with them to loosen trade restrictions.

But that is, of course, exactly what happened. Over the past year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang slowly won over Trump, eventually persuading him to let Nvidia sell the H200 — its second-most powerful chip — to the Chinese market, with the US government taking a 25 percent cut. With America’s most advanced chips flooding into a market known for brazen IP theft, Sullivan is deeply alarmed that AI companies are literally delivering the United States’ technological advantage to a country that openly wants to surpass America. But even though the AI arms race is often compared to the nuclear arms race during the Cold War, there’s one crucial difference. The government funded nuclear research for the primary purpose of national defense, but tech companies are funding AI research for the primary purpose of making untold amounts of money. “Maybe that was a failure of imagination on my part,” admitted Sullivan.

Below, Sullivan and I have wide-ranging conversation about the current state of Trump’s AI policy, the lessons that Nvidia should take away from Tesla’s failures in the Chinese market, what he would have done if DeepSeek had been unveiled while he was still National Security Advisor, and — given that it was barely a day since the United States’ shocking abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro — if the Trump administration would cite increased AI data center power consumption as a pretext for seizing Venezuela’s oil industry. (His assessment: “I would not put it past them.”)

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tina Nguyen: You’ve spent years warning about the risks of China overtaking America in the AI race. But then Trump comes in, rolls back the entirety of Biden’s AI executive order, and makes America’s AI policy friendlier to the industry. Republicans in Congress and the White House would argue that lifting regulations on trade and development would achieve the same goal of beating China in the AI race. What are your thoughts on that?

Jake Sullivan: Well, one of the most important moves that we made during the Biden administration was to impose export controls on the sale of advanced chips to China for use for training of frontier AI models. And the fact that President Trump is now permitting the sale of some of these chips, in particular the H200, is just a gift to China, whose main constraint at the moment is not power, not money, not talent. It’s chips. And we are now basically filling that hole for them. I see no way in which that could possibly be anything other than an advantage to China, in the race between the US and China at the frontier of AI.

And it goes beyond just the frontier, because the compute constraint for China also goes to their ability to serve their models globally — to become the AI backbone upon which the world runs. Prior to this decision, China was having trouble building data centers outside of China because they couldn’t produce enough of their own chips to do so. Now, they can have Tencent and Alibaba and other companies essentially building data centers using American chips to serve Chinese models to the rest of the world.

I do not see how that works on anyone’s terms to benefit the United States — and especially on the terms set out by David Sacks and Donald Trump, who want to see the world run on an American technology stack.

A couple days ago, the US announced that it would allow TSMC to import US-made equipment into their Chinese factories. I believe the argument they’re making is, “Oh, we’re basically using American technology to manufacture chips in China.”

In general, my view is that export controls, both on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on the most advanced AI chips, is necessary to protect America’s national security and advance America’s edge, vis-a-vis China in AI. And I don’t believe that it will come at a long-term commercial cost to the United States, because the demand for this equipment and the demand for these chips is so great that there will be a growing market in the rest of the world for American firms, whether it’s Nvidia or one of the American chip equipment makers. So I don’t buy the argument that we have to allow them to sell some of the most advanced technology into China to make sure that they can earn sufficient returns to continue to grow their companies.

Just to give you one example: Nvidia, in 2022, objected to the export controls that we put into place and said, If you put these export controls on the A100 and the H100 chips, we are going to lose a lot of money. At that point, Nvidia’s market cap, I believe, was south of $400 billion. Fast forward three years: Those controls have been in place the whole time and Nvidia’s market cap is now in the multiple trillions of dollars.

It’s the most valuable company in the world at this point.

Exactly. And why? Because the demand outside of China is so great, and will continue to be great long into the future. So I have a real concern about the willingness of this administration to trade very short-term commercial gains for what I think will be a long-term cost. History over the course of the past few decades has been littered with cases of American companies wanting to sell into China to make immediate profits, only to learn later that once China mastered the technology and then poured money into the industry, [the companies] ended up getting screwed over time.

I mean, that’s basically what happened to electric vehicles, right?

Exactly. The idea had been that Tesla and Elon Musk thought, Get me a foothold into the Chinese market. Play nice with the Chinese government. This will give me access to a billion-plus people, and at the end of the day, it will help Tesla.

Logically, there’s some basis to believe that. But the life of policy is not logic, but experience. And experience has taught us repeatedly that what happens is: We go into the Chinese market. The Chinese find ways to essentially use the presence of the US there — whether through technology transfer, outright theft, or just brutal competition — and end up surpassing, and then ultimately evicting, the American tech or the American product from their market. We saw that happen with electric vehicles. I think we’re going to end up seeing it with respect to these advanced AI compute technologies, because China is determined — and has said this from the very top for many years, long before these export controls were ever put into place — that they intend to end their dependence on American chip technology, and to try to become a major competitor to American chip technology globally.

“[T]hey can have Tencent and Alibaba and other companies essentially building data centers using American chips to serve Chinese models to the rest of the world”

So what you’re saying is that the companies themselves will also see a long-term detrimental effect from selling to China?

My view is that in the short term, they will be able to book more orders. In the long term, they are contributing to a competitor that is going to squeeze them over time. I can’t make exact predictions about the future, and I’m not sitting in these boardrooms and I’m not seeing exactly what’s happening. But I would just say we have seen many, many examples of companies thinking that this is going to be a long-term success story, only to find ultimately that their entry into the Chinese market hurt their capacity over time.

Now, one thing I will note in particular. I think Nvidia is looking at chip demand globally and has a concern that it now has competition outside of China: Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium, potential other entrants into the GPU market. And so it’s thinking, What do we do about this? Part of their answer to that threat, that some of the other hyperscalers in particular will not be sourcing Nvidia chips in the future, is to think: We need the Chinese market for this reason. I see that logic. I ultimately have questions about whether that will work for Nvidia. But what I know for certain is that it will not work for the United States of America, from our national security and national interest perspective, to allow Nvidia to sell these advanced chips to China.

I was reading an interview that you did with Time magazine last year, and you mentioned that during your time in the White House, you ran a war room simulation about the China/US AI race. To the extent that you’re able to talk about it, did you ever run a scenario where the private sector’s interests won out over government?

I confess that we did not factor in the possibility that we would actually be rolling back our export controls. We were operating scenarios presuming continuity of the export control policy. Now maybe that was a failure of imagination on my part, but having seen the first Trump administration — where they actually pursued a policy consistent with what the Biden administration very much built up on and expanded in our time in office — I was not expecting to see this administration come in and make these moves. And frankly, it’s come as something of a surprise to me. I think it’s come as a surprise not just to critics of the Trump administration, but many [of his] supporters in Congress, Republicans in Congress, who are stunned to have seen the Trump administration making moves along these lines.

Now that you’re a private citizen, could you possibly game out the results of this scenario?

There’s a few things happening now that deeply concern me. We’ve just talked about the chip controls issue, both with respect to the chips and to the manufacturing equipment that makes the chips.

The second thing that concerns me is the private sector. Many elements of the private sector are saying to the Trump administration, Get entirely out of the game of safety and security alignment issues. We want a regulation-free, completely laissez-faire, let-’er-rip approach. And that has been reflected in the public statements and the public policy of the Trump administration. My concern is that we may end up in a circumstance in which China is dominating the global conversation over standards, with the United States virtually absent from the table. I think that is another area in which China could actually seek gains in its ability to become a dominant global AI player, where the United States is simply absenting itself, in part, at the behest of a private sector saying, Hey, the government shouldn’t be involved in this whole question of standards or regulation or safety or the like.

The third area that concerns me is when it comes to the question of talent and America’s ability to attract the best talent from around the world. This administration is taking a series of steps that is putting up a “not welcome” sign. It is going to make it harder for us to get the very best engineers and very best minds when it comes to AI going forward. I think that that is going to put us at a disadvantage as well.

And then the final area is: America’s long-term innovation edge has always been built on basic research, and this administration is slashing the budget for basic research. I think that that is problematic because if you rely entirely on the private sector to do all of your innovation, they can do amazing things, and our AI companies have done amazing things, and I have huge respect for the breakthroughs that they have made. But you also need research at universities, with National Science Foundation grants, that are looking not for a commercial advantage, but just for very basic scientific breakthroughs. It is that kind of research that ultimately leads to the greatest revolutions over time. Slashing that money and relying entirely on, basically, the big technology companies to do the work for innovation — I think [this] is problematic from the point of view of the US. It is disrupting a formula that has worked for us time and time again over multiple decades.

One of the things I focus on is Trump’s transactionalism with Big Tech, and what he wants from AI companies in return for doing them this massive regulatory favor.  You’re seeing OpenAI’s leaders donate to MAGA super PACs that boost him and his candidates. Now Trump is asking them to prevent “woke AI,” attacking Colorado’s approach to prevent algorithmic discrimination. What are your thoughts about the AI industry itself becoming partisan?

I think it’s dangerous for any industry to wear the jersey of one political party or the other. When I was national security adviser, I worked hard to have good relationships with the leaders of all the major frontier AI companies. I think I succeeded in doing that, even though it was obviously widely reported that there were tensions between the administration and many of those companies. I think it’s important for senior government officials to develop good relationships, to understand where these companies are coming from. These companies are, in my view, a national asset of the United States. It is good that we have the most cutting-edge technology companies in the world, but it is also right and proper for the US government to ensure that there are proper regulations, norms, guardrails in place, both to protect the safety of Americans and to protect our national security.

If an entire industry decides we’re going all in with one administration or one political party, or cutting deals, both political and financial, with an administration, it worries me that that is going to end up eroding what is one of America’s greatest strengths, which is that we don’t have this kind of entanglement of the private sector with our government, in ways that other countries have seen and have suffered from. So I would hope that the technology industry would think about the long term, and about the need to have good relationships with political actors across the spectrum, and to stay out of trying to make big bets on what exactly is going to happen in American politics, since none of us can can predict that, by any stretch of the imagination.

So this is a bit of a hypothetical, but if you had still been national security adviser when DeepSeek was unveiled, what would have your response been?

I think that the Chinese government actually played a role in hyping the DeepSeek release in order to send a message through their propaganda, relentlessly — and sadly, somewhat effectively — to voices in the West, basically saying: Resistance is futile. Your export controls cannot work. Give up on them. The whole chip strategy has not succeeded. That is what they tried to do. And that is nonsense.

You know how we know that is nonsense? If I had still been national security adviser, I would have been pointing this out at every chance I got: DeepSeek’s CEO himself has repeatedly said that their main constraint is chips. Their main constraint is compute. What has made it difficult for them since that release at the beginning of last year, to continue to march forward at the pace they want to march forward, is they have not had access to high-end American GPUs. President Trump is now making it easier for them.

I would have been stressing that there is more hype here about what this means for America’s compute advantage than there is reality. And in fact, the DeepSeek release, in a way, reinforced the need for effective, enforced, and in some instances, expanded American export controls when it comes to high-end GPUs.

“I think it’s dangerous for any industry to wear the jersey of one political party or the other”

Do you think the Trump administration has done anything right in the AI race against China?

Well, first, I think they have put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the AI revolution that we’re in the midst of. I think they have properly recognized that this is an incredibly important moment. They have put a lot of high-level policy attention behind it. They are not neglecting it. I think the choices they’re making aren’t great, but I’m glad to see them elevating and prioritizing the issue.

Second, they have largely abandoned the safety agenda. I think it is wrong and history will judge it as having been wrong. But one area where the AI Action Plan did, in fact, continue the Biden administration’s approach, was on safety when it comes to the risk of bio-uplift: the potential for convergence between AI and bioweapons in ways that could harm the security of the American people and people everywhere around the world. So I think that that has been a good thing for them too. And there have been these interesting initiatives like the Pax Silica, an effort to work with some friends and partners of the United States on chip technology, on other aspects of AI science and tech. I think that work is valuable work and should continue, and I want to see a further doubling down on engaging with allies, friends, partners in Europe, Asia, and other places as we go forward.

But [overall], I think the administration has taken steps to reduce America’s innovation edge, increase China’s access to advanced compute, and erode America’s leadership role in terms of the standard setting necessary for being the global leader on AI. So I don’t have a very good story to tell, I’m afraid, although some of these steps, I think, deserve praise.

Given how rapidly the situation is changing, I only have one Venezuela question, but I do want to loop it into the context of AI data centers and energy consumption. The International Energy Agency projects that by 2030, the US’ total energy consumption is going to rise by 10 percent, probably more, due to the demand for AI data centers. Forty percent of it is likely going to come from fossil fuels. What are things to keep in mind as Venezuela gets taken over by America and possibly has its oil seized?

First, the idea that we would engage in military action, with the primary purpose appearing to be increasing preferential access for American oil companies to a foreign country’s oil — that, I find disturbing, and frankly, a little bit bizarre.

The chief issue that I see in the United States right now, when it comes to the power necessary for the AI revolution going forward, is about creating generation and transmission capability and improving our grid. It’s not about pumping more oil out of the ground. And frankly, China’s gotten the memo that the Trump administration has completely refused to read. Over time, the [dropping] price point of clean energy — including solar and other forms of clean energy technology — [is] going to mean that, as this goes forward, betting big on heavy crude from Venezuela as part of an answer to an AI energy challenge? I must say, I don’t find that particularly convincing. I haven’t heard them make that argument, but I don’t think it holds a lot of water.

It seems like something they would totally just throw out there.

If you want a nice, relaxing change of pace, my suggestion is that you go read our live coverage of CES this week. We’ve got a team reporting from the expo floor in Vegas, editor-in-chief Nilay Patel is taping a live episode of Decoder, and I’ve already found my new favorite consumer electronic of 2026:

Happy New Year, everybody! See you next week.

Amazon is currently discounting many of its e-readers, particularly last-gen models.

When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doomscrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.

Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.

In fact, two new Scribes have just hit the market: a snazzy color model called the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and a black-and-white mid-tier model called the Amazon Kindle Scribe 32GB. A new entry-level Scribe without a front light will also be available soon, though Amazon has yet to provide a specific release date.

Meanwhile, many of Amazon’s last-gen e-readers are still available (and at nice discounts).

Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference.

The most recent entry-level Kindle — which starts at an MSRP of $109.99 — was introduced in 2024. It boasts a bright 94-nit display, fine contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns than the 2022 version. It also comes in a “matcha” green, just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.

In the past, Amazon’s ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $79.99 ($30 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, you can buy the base-model Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $89.99 ($20 off), which is a pretty good discount.

Amazon’s most recent entry-level Kindle features a 6-inch, 300ppi display, support for USB-C charging, and up to six weeks of battery life. It’s also brighter than previous models and offers noticeably faster performance.

Amazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The latest Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.

In terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.

Previously, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target at its full price of $129.99.

Amazon’s Kindle Kids is identical to the standard Kindle — meaning it packs a 300ppi display and support for USB-C charging — but comes with a case, an extended two-year warranty, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.

The latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched in 2024, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.

During events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $124.99. Sadly, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).

Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review.

The seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite features a larger display and faster performance than Amazon’s entry-level ebook reader. You can also buy it in a bundle with a cover and a USB-C charger.

Like other Kindles, the newest Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations — including an ad-free Signature Edition that’s identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that automatically adjusts when needed.

In the past, the Signature Edition has been discounted to $149.99 ($50 off). Currently, however, it is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual price of $199.99. You can also pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off). It’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in black, green, or pink for $257.97 ($25 off).

The premium Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition offers the same design and performance as the standard model but with more storage and support for wireless charging.

Amazon’s step-up Kindle Paperwhite bundle includes a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, a wireless charging dock, and your choice of either a fabric or plant-based cover.

Amazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers optional parental controls. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.

Although the Kindle Paperwhite Kids has been known to occasionally drop to $129.99 ($50 off) during special sales events, it’s currently only available for its usual price of $179.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.

Amazon’s kid-friendly Paperwhite is the same as the standard Paperwhite, but it’s ad-free and comes with the added benefits of a two-year hardware protection plan, six months of Amazon Kids Plus, and a choice of three kid-friendly covers.

The third-gen Kindle Scribe, which launched late last year, is even bigger than its 10.2-inch predecessor. It offers an 11-inch display with 300ppi resolution, 32GB of storage, and the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the last Scribe, Amazon introduced a new Active Canvas feature — letting you scribble notes directly on ebook pages — as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting. The latest version adds a Premium Pen, a front light, and slimmer bezels than its second-gen cousin.

Amazon’s third-gen Scribe is currently selling for $499.99 at Amazon, which is the typical MSRP. A less expensive version should also be available soon; it drops storage to 16GB and removes the front light, but still includes the premium pen. It will be priced at $429.99 at launch.

The third-gen Kindle Scribe 32GB is even bigger than its 10.2-inch predecessor; it offers an 11-inch display with 300ppi resolution and the same great battery life that Kindles are known for.

The recently launched Kindle Scribe Colorsoft adds color to the mix, while offering the same dimensions as the third-gen Scribe, along with front lighting, the ability to take and upload notes, and great battery life. However, our reviewer noted that the colors aren’t particularly vibrant and that there’s minimal ghosting. She also found the device’s thinness somewhat limiting, making it more challenging to use in certain situations, such as one-handed bus riding. The new Scribe Colorsoft comes with 32GB of storage for $629.99; if you want 64GB, it will run you $679.99.

The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon’s first note-taking e-reader with a color screen. It features an 11-inch display, a slimmer design, an improved interface, an updated stylus, and a new AI-powered search feature that can quickly summarize documents.

If you want to save a bit of cash, you can pick up the second-gen (but still excellent) Kindle Scribe, which is on sale with 16GB and a Premium Pen for $279.99 ($120 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also get the 32GB version for $10 more at Amazon and Best Buy. And you can also pick up the 16GB Scribe at Amazon as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and a plant-based leather cover starting at $444.97 ($55 off).

The 2024 Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes. It’s faster than its predecessor and offers a host of new features, including one that lets you jot notes directly in your book.

Amazon’s base Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle comes with a 16GB Kindle Scribe, a Premium Pen, a power adapter, and a cover in the color of your choice.

Toward the end of 2024, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.

More recently, Amazon introduced a cheaper Colorsoft, one that comes with only 16GB of storage. It lacks wireless charging and an auto-adjusting front light, but it’s otherwise identical to the first-gen model. The 16GB model has a full retail price of $249.99; it went down to $169.99 on Black Friday, though you can still get it now for $199.99 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. The 32GB Signature Edition, meanwhile, is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual asking price of $279.99.

That said, you can save some money at Amazon on the step-up model if you buy it as part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black, pink, or green. If you want a more premium experience, Amazon also sells it with a leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off).

The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display. It also boasts 32GB of storage, waterproofing, and support for wireless charging.

The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first color e-reader. It comes with wireless charging, IPX8 water resistance, and 32GB of storage. It retails for $279.99 by itself, but Amazon also sells it as part of a bundle that contains a wireless charging dock and one of two covers.

In July of 2025, Amazon announced a kid-friendly version of the Colorsoft with 16GB of storage and an MSRP of $269.99. Like the Signature Edition, the Kindle Colorsoft Kids offers a seven-inch color display and IPX8 water resistance, but it lacks wireless charging. The ad-free ebook reader also comes with one of two covers, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, an extended two-year warranty, and optional parental controls.

Although it fell to $189.99 ($80 off) as recently as November, the Colorsoft Kids is currently only available for $219.99 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.

Like the standard model, Amazon’s kid-friendly Colorsoft comes with a seven-inch color display and waterproofing. The 16GB e-reader also offers parental controls, a two-year warranty, a protective cover, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus.

            <div id="article-text">A viral influencer video on daycares in Minneapolis shows that under the Trump administration, content begets policy.﻿

A viral influencer video on daycares in Minneapolis shows that under the Trump administration, content begets policy.﻿

Just a day after publishing a 40-minute video alleging fraud at Minnesota daycare centers, Nick Shirley had the vice president’s attention.

In Shirley’s video, he and another man identified only as “David” roam Minneapolis with cameras and microphones, demanding entrance to daycare centers they say are operated by members of the local Somali community. With scant evidence, Shirley accuses the centers of sweeping fraud, tying it to previous federal fraud cases pursued by Joe Biden’s administration in Minnesota. The men knock on doors, argue with workers who refuse them entry, and conduct man-on-the-street-style interviews, asking people if they’ve ever seen children at the centers.

The fraud Shirley claims he’s found remains elusive. Following his video, state officials visited nine businesses featured and found they were “operating as expected,” with children present at eight and one center that wasn’t yet open. State officials told reporters that previous investigations into some of the centers did not uncover evidence of fraud; four investigations are ongoing, they said. Officials also said that one of the childcare centers Shirley visited had been closed since 2022.

None of this stopped the video from going viral, however, or catching the eye of President Donald Trump’s administration. “This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer Prizes],” JD Vance said on X of Shirley, a 23-year-old right-wing content creator who fashions himself as a citizen journalist. Shirley’s post on X has 138 million “views” — the number of times a post was shown to X users — and more than 3 million views on YouTube. A few days after Shirley posted the video, federal agencies had launched a childcare fraud tipline, promising to prosecute violators “to the FULLEST extent of the law.”

There has never been a better time to be a far-right content creator

Within days, Shirley’s video had been used to trigger a national news cycle. Donald Trump’s administration said it would freeze federal childcare funding to Minnesota, where local childcare centers reported threats, break-ins, and frightened families in the wake of the video. Thousands of federal agents would be deployed to Minneapolis, the administration said. Shirley’s daycare stunt is one of many: In a previous video, he paid day laborers $20 to hold pro-Biden signs in front of the White House. And his work — along with that of countless other influencers — is grist for a content mill that now has a direct audience at the highest levels of power.

There has never been a better time to be a far-right content creator. The right has built an empire of online personalities, shows, and outlets that reach millions of people across platforms, centered on Elon Musk’s X: a place where influencers, government officials, and foreign grifters commingle, overseen by a billionaire owner that aligns with them politically. Shirley and others like him are able to elicit maximum attention and reaction — from officials with a penchant for posting, like Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, and by extension from everyone else reacting to the news. Viral content becomes official government policy.

The line between influencer and politician is a thin one. The Intercept reported that “David” from the video was David Hoch, who previously ran for Minnesota attorney general and called Muslims “demons” on now-deleted social media accounts. In the video, Hoch says the information he has is “100 percent accurate coming directly from research done by people at the state capitol”; The Intercept reported on ties between Hoch and a Republican staffer who appears in emails shown in Shirley’s video. Minnesota state Rep. Lisa Demuth — a Republican running for governor — also claimed to have worked with Shirley to “expose fraud.” Shirley initially denied knowing who Demuth was and accused her of “clout chasing” before quickly pivoting and wishing her luck on her campaign. Shirley did not immediately respond to questions about whether he, Hoch, or his team had communicated with state and federal officials while producing the video.

A viral post can bestow both algorithmic success and a rapid response from the federal government. In October 2025, Savanah Hernandez, a Turning Point USA-aligned content creator, posted a short video on X showing merchants on Canal Street in New York City. “One of the migrants explained to me that they’re operating ‘without a license’ and if the police catch them, they’ll confiscate all of their items,” Hernandez wrote. “Perhaps @ICEgov should go check this corner out.” Shirley had earlier done the same schtick, in a YouTube video titled “I Confronted Dangerous Migrant Scammers in NYC | Canal Street.”

A few days after Hernandez’s post, dozens of federal agents swarmed the area in a raid targeting street vendors. The Department of Homeland Security said on X it had arrested nine immigrants; four US citizens were also reportedly held without federal charges. (Hernandez and Shirley both participated in a White House-hosted event on antifa in October.)

Shirley’s video from Minneapolis takes a well-worn YouTuber format and applies it to a high-profile situation that has been in the news for years. Shirley uses dramatic music to set the tone and an unpolished filming style to make viewers feel like they’re there — that because they did not see any children present, there must be massive fraud happening. Nuance, details, confirmation, or follow-up doesn’t suit a format that is measured primarily by whether you get enough watch time to be able to monetize your video.

Influencers have supplanted cable news talking heads as megaphones for politicians’ messages and platforms. They are cheap, fast, and savvy — drop a clickbait video on platforms like X, which can then act like a tornado maker for right-wing fury. Influencers know that information doesn’t need to be new, true, or fair. It just needs to hit at the right time and be boosted by the right people, at which point it might even get picked up by traditional news outlets, as the daycare story did. The Trump administration knows the influencer game well because its ranks are filled with them. That the president and senior staff have X tabs open on a giant screen in a war room tells us where they believe politics and governing take place.

In December, Axios published a chart visualizing search interest throughout 2025 for dozens of trending news cycles: Jeffrey Epstein, Charlie Kirk, RealID, Cracker Barrel. Most of these topics peak when news hits and then trickle off — but some endure for months with intermittent surges, like searches for Gaza, inflation, Labubus, and KPop Demon Hunters. If you rely on social media algorithms for your livelihood, audience, or to maintain power, you must stay on trend at all times and develop an ability to see a wave before it crashes.

If we made a chart for 2026 news cycles, “Somali daycare fraud” may very well be one of these flashes in the pan that surges and then disappears. Whatever other viral news events this year brings, we should expect to see the influencers — elected and not — swarm and milk them dry before carrying on to the next crisis. Each event will be the “the worst fraud in human history.” Merch will follow. The feds will not be far behind.

            <div id="article-text">CES used to be a car show. Now its another stop on the AI hype train.

CES used to be a car show. Now its another stop on the AI hype train.

It says a lot about the current moment when one of the world’s largest EV sellers shows up at the world’s biggest electronics show to announce not a new, more affordable model or a cool futuristic concept car, but a humanoid robot. And one we’ve seen already.

Hyundai’s decision to use its CES keynote to tout Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot sends a pretty clear message about how the auto industry is absorbing the bad news about EVs in the United States in 2025, and where it thinks things are heading in the new year. EVs are out, and AI and robotaxis are in.

In addition to Hyundai, Mercedes announced its plans to roll out its Nvidia-powered Level 2++ driver assist feature in the US later this year. Also coming in 2026 is Uber’s new Lucid Gravity robotaxi, which was also on display at CES. And Nvidia, the world’s biggest chipmaker and arguably the company most responsible for the current AI bubble, announced a new family of open-source models called Alpamayo, which it says will power new autonomous and driver-assistance features.

CES has always been a hotbed for robots and other assorted AI ephemera, but it also used to be the hottest car show around. It’s where Chevy announced its first mass-market EV, the Bolt, and where everyone from Honda to BMW to Ram would gather to show off future battery-powered concepts. You could see color-changing cars, shape-shifting vans, and even a few flying cars if you were lucky.

This year, the only thing with four-wheels to make its debut was Sony and Honda’s new Afeela SUV prototype. The regular Afeela was there too, five years after its initial debut and still just short of production.

It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given the current dour mood around EVs. Growth in global sales is expected to slow significantly in 2026, as China winds down some EV subsidies, Europe wavers on its ban on the sale of gas cars, and the US reverses much of its own policies to get more people to buy EVs. Automakers across the board are reining in their EV plans, pivoting instead to hybrids and extended-range EVs.

Meanwhile, AI continues to suck all the air out of the room. Car companies seem to think that in order to be taken seriously by Wall Streets’ overly exuberant investors they need to have an AI strategy, or a chatbot, or even a humanoid robot. It’s not enough to just sell cars anymore.

Maybe someday CES will reemerge as a car show. Maybe when the auto industry is feeling less anxious about global trade and rising manufacturing costs, it’ll be ready to give us a glimpse of the future again.

AI spider routers are out, polyhedral dice routers are in.

The first Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips made a surprise appearance at CES 2026, and could launch this year, only a couple of years after Wi-Fi 7 debuted. So, if you don’t already have a Wi-Fi 7 router — and many of us don’t — you might want to consider holding off on upgrading.

Rather than focusing on speed upgrades, Wi-Fi 8 promises improved stability. It offers the high speeds and bandwidth of Wi-Fi 7, but with improved power efficiency, higher throughput, and better peer-to-peer communication between devices. Wi-Fi 8 is also better at maintaining fast, stable connections when users are moving devices around, or moving them further away from their router. As a result, Wi-Fi 8 users will experience less “dropping out” or freezing and better streaming and gaming performance.

If this week’s CES announcements are any indication, we’ll be able to try out Wi-Fi 8 for ourselves within the year.

Asus went from last year’s AI spider router covered in antennas to the ROG NeoCore, a Wi-Fi 8 concept router with no antennas at all. The polyhedral mock up The Verge’s Sean Hollister got a look at this week resembles a 20-sided die with a hollow bottom. According to Asus, the production model will offer the same data speeds as Wi-Fi 7, but with higher throughput and lower latency, so it can move more data with fewer bottlenecks and less lag.

“The plastic mockup broke when I picked it up,” reported Hollister from the Asus booth. “Perfect,” responded Nilay Patel, Editor in Chief of The Verge.

Broadcom also announced some Wi-Fi 8 gear at CES, including the BCM4918 APU and two new dual-band radios, the BCM6714 and BCM6719. All three devices are intended for powering residential Wi-Fi 8 routers and service provider gateways.

Similarly, on Monday, MediaTek announced its family of Wi-Fi 8 chips, Filogic 8000, which it says will power “premium and flagship devices leveraging Wi-Fi 8 technology,” everything from enterprise access points to smartphones, laptops, TVs, and smart home devices. The first gear featuring a Filogic 8000 chip is expected to launch later this year.

These new routers and chipsets are arriving only a few months after TP-Link demonstrated the first Wi-Fi 8 prototype connection in October. Despite brands going full steam ahead with Wi-Fi 8, the official IEEE 802.11bn specification hasn’t actually been finalized yet. The current IEEE timeline predicts that the Wi-Fi 8 standard won’t be ratified until mid to late 2028. Yet, Asus says its first Wi-Fi 8 routers are slated to launch this year. Early hardware would be based on a draft version of the spec, and would likely need a firmware update down the road to match up with the final specification.

“What you are seeing at CES around Wi-Fi 8 reflects industry excitement for the next generation of Wi-Fi,” Kevin Robinson, CEO of the non-profit Wi-Fi Alliance, said in a statement to The Verge. “Wi-Fi Alliance is in the early stages of selecting Wi-Fi 8 features, and it is common for the Wi-Fi ecosystem to begin its work on silicon, reference designs, early product development, and technology previews ahead of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED availability.”

            <h2>Powering up (and saving) the planet</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”

Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.

“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”

MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).

But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.

Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of MIT Technology Review.)

Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” MIT Alumni News, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.

“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”

The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.

“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”

The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”

“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.

Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”

MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.

About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.

With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.”

In Wang’s view, getting big results depends on taking a big-picture, holistic approach that will require unprecedented levels of collaboration. “MIT faculty have always treasured their independence and autonomy,” she says. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to let 1,000 flowers bloom. And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?”

To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”

Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”

Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.

“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”

“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”

Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”

Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.

Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.

“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”

Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”

Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.

“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”

Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.

But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The New York Times reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.

Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”

Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”

While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.

Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”

MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at climateproject.mit.edu.

While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”

“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”

Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”

            <div id="article-text">Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.

An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.

Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.

Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.

“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to SpaceCamp, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.

The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.

“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in Top Gun. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”

A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.

Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”

At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”

“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”

The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”

So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”

Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called Nine Lives, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show Wired Science, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.

Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.

Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”

Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”

Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”

There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 1022 stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.

“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”

Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.

Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.

Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”

Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of Daring to Rest: Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.

Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.

On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light.”

“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”

Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.

Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”

The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”

With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science.

“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”

That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.

Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”

            <h2>Dennis Whyte’s fusion quest</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since nuclear fusion was discovered in the 1930s, scientists have wondered if we could somehow replicate and harness the phenomenon behind starlight—the smashing together of hydrogen atoms to form helium and a stupendous amount of clean energy. Fusing hydrogen would yield 200 million times more energy than simply burning it. Unlike nuclear fission, which powers the world’s 440 atomic reactors, hydrogen fusion produces no harmful radiation, only neutrons that are captured and added back to the reaction. Instead of radioactive wastes with long, lethal half-lives, fusion’s by-product is helium, the most stable element—and a year’s worth from a fusion plant wouldn’t supply a party balloon business.

Dennis Whyte’s part in the fusion quest began in graduate school, in a lab belonging to the electric utility Hydro-Québec, just outside Montreal. There he was shown a device built to replicate stellar fusion on an earthly scale. It was a doughnut-shaped hollow chamber, big enough for a lanky physicist like him to stand inside, based on a design conceived in 1950 by the future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, who also developed hydrogen bombs for the Soviet Union. It was called a tokamak, a word derived from a Russian phrase meaning “ring-shaped chamber with magnetic coils.”

The idea is straightforward: Fill the doughnut with hydrogen gas, and then heat that gas until it turns to electrically charged plasma. In this ionic state, plasma would be held in place by magnets positioned around the tokamak. Achieving fusion on Earth without the immense pressure of a star’s interior, scientists calculated, would require temperatures nearly 10 times hotter than our sun’s center—around 100 million degrees Celsius. So the trick would be to suspend the hot plasma so perfectly in a surrounding magnetic field that it wouldn’t touch inner surfaces of the chamber. Such contact would instantly cool it, stopping the fusion reaction.

The good part about that was safety. In a failure, a fusion power plant wouldn’t melt down—just the opposite. The bad part was that gaseous plasma wasn’t very cooperative—any slight irregularity in the chamber walls could cause destabilizing turbulence. But the concept was so tantalizing that by the mid-1980s, 75 universities and governmental institutes around the world had tokamaks. If anyone could get fusion—the most energy-dense reaction in the universe—to work, the deuterium in a liter of seawater could meet one person’s electricity needs for a year. It would be, effectively, a limitless resource.

Besides turbulence, there were two other big obstacles. The magnets surrounding the plasma needed to be really powerful—meaning really big. In 1986, 35 nations representing half the world’s population—including the US, China, India, Japan, what is now the entire European Union, South Korea, and Russia—agreed to jointly build the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a $40 billion giant tokamak in southern France. Standing 100 feet tall on a 180-acre site, ITER (the acronym also formed the Latin word for “journey”) is equipped with 18 magnets weighing 360 tons apiece, made from the best superconductors then available. If it works, ITER will produce 500 megawatts of electricity—but not before 2035, if then. It’s still under construction. The second obstacle is the biggest: Many tokamaks have briefly achieved fusion, but doing so always took more energy than they produced.

After earning his doctorate in 1992, Whyte worked on an ITER prototype at San Diego’s National Fusion Facility, taught at the University of Wisconsin, and in 2006 was hired by MIT. By then, he understood how huge the stakes were, and how life-changing commercial-scale fusion energy could be—if it could be sustained, and if it could be produced affordably.

MIT had been trying since 1969. The red brick buildings of its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, where Whyte came to work, had originally housed the National Biscuit Company. PSFC’s sixth tokamak, Alcator C-Mod, built in 1991, was in Nabisco’s old Oreo cookie factory. C-Mod’s magnets were coiled with copper to serve as a conductor (think of how copper wire wrapped around a nail and connected to a battery turns it into an electromagnet). Before C-Mod was finally decommissioned, its magnetic fields, 160,000 times stronger than Earth’s, set the world record for the highest plasma pressure in a tokamak.

As Ohm’s law describes, however, metals like copper have internal resistance, so it could run for only four seconds before overheating—and needed more energy to ignite its fusion reactions than what came out of it. Like the now 160 similar tokamaks around the world, C-Mod was an interesting science experiment but mainly reinforced the joke that fusion energy was 20 years away and always would be.

Each year, Whyte had challenged PhD students in his fusion design classes to conjure something just as compact as C-Mod, one-800th the scale of ITER, that could achieve and sustain fusion—with an energy gain. But in 2013, as he neared 50, he increasingly had doubts. He’d devoted his career to the fusion dream, but unless something radically changed, he feared it wouldn’t happen in his lifetime.

The US Department of Energy decided to scale back on fusion. It informed MIT that funding for Alcator C-Mod would end in 2016. So Whyte decided he would either quit fusion and do something else or try something different to get there faster.

There was a new generation of ceramic “high-temperature” superconductors, not available when ITER’s huge magnets were being wrapped in metallic superconducting cable, which has to be chilled to 4 kelvin above absolute zero (–452.47 °F) for its resistance to current to fall to zero. Discovered accidentally in 1986 in a Swiss lab, the new ceramic superconductors still needed to be cooled to 20 K (–423.7 °F). But with far smaller power requirements, their output was so much greater that a year later the discoverers won a Nobel Prize.

The potential applications were limitless, but because ceramic is so brittle, coiling it around electromagnets wasn’t feasible. Then one day Whyte ran into research scientist Leslie Bromberg ’73, PhD ’77, in the hallway holding a fistful of what resembled unspooled tape from a VCR cassette. “What’s all that?” he asked.

“Superconducting tape, new stuff.” The filmy strips were coated with ceramic crystals of rare-earth barium copper oxide. “It’s called ReBCO,” Bromberg said.

ReBCO’s rare-earth component, yttrium, is 400 times more common than silver. Could superconducting tape, Whyte immediately wondered, be wound like copper wire to make much smaller but far more powerful magnets?

The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards.

He assigned his 2013 fusion design class to see. If the students managed to double the strength of a magnetic field surrounding hot plasma, he knew, they might multiply fusion’s power density sixteenfold. They came up with an eye-­opening design they called Vulcan. It yielded five peer-reviewed papers—but whether layers of wound ReBCO tape could stand the stress of the current needed to hold plasma suspended while being superheated to ignite a fusion reaction was unknown.

For two years, his classes refined Vulcan. By 2015, with ReBCO more consistent in quality and supply, he challenged his students—11 male and one female, including an Argentine, a Russian, and a Korean—to outdo what 35 nations had been attempting for nearly 30 years.

“Let’s see if ReBCO lets us build a 500-megawatt tokamak—the same as ITER, only way smaller.”

If superconducting tape could let them make a fusion reactor to fit the footprint of a decommissioned coal-fired plant, he told them, it could plug right into existing power lines. To then make enough carbon-­free energy to stop pushing Earth’s climate past the edge, its components would have to be mass-­producible, so any competent contractor could assemble and service them.

The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards. Divided into teams, the students set about figuring out how thin-tape electromagnets could be made robust, and how to capture neutrons expelled from fusion reactions so their heat could be used for turning a turbine—and so they could be harnessed to breed more tritium for the plasma. That’s crucial, because natural tritium is exceedingly rare. Since ReBCO-wrapped magnets would be so much smaller, shrinking the dimensions of one component rippled through everything else. One team’s innovations fed another’s, and parts of the design started to link together. As excitement spread through PSFC, members of earlier classes, now postdocs or faculty members, pitched in. Whyte’s students, some with doctoral dissertations due, were putting in 50-hour weeks on this, reminding him of why he’d dreamed of fusion in first place.

Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics.

And then, at the semester’s end, out popped their design. Just over 10 feet in diameter, it actually looked like a prototype power plant. While ITER had massive shielding, their tokamak would be wrapped in a compact blanket containing a molten-salt mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride to absorb the heat of the neutrons escaping from the fusion reaction. Those neutrons would also react with the lithium to breed more tritium.

The blanket’s heat would be tapped for electricity—except one-fifth of the heat energy would remain in the plasma, meaning the reaction was now heating itself and was self-sustaining, producing more energy than was needed to ignite it. Net fusion energy had been achieved.

The ReBCO magnets, although just a 40th the size of ITER’s, could deliver a magnetic field strength of 23 tesla (a hospital MRI machine typically operates at 1.5 tesla). That was more than enough to achieve a fusion reaction, yet it would require less electricity than its copper-clad C-Mod predecessor by a factor of 2,000. Everything was designed for easy maintenance, and parts could be replaced without having to dismantle the entire reactor.

Most important, the calculated energy output was more than 13 times the input.

Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics. He calculated the cost per watt and was astonished. Suddenly their goal wasn’t just building a much smaller ITER. It was being commercially competitive.

Stunned, he told his wife, “This can actually work.”

They called it ARC, for “affordable, robust, compact.” “Buildable in a decade,” Whyte predicted.The peer-reviewed article his 12 students published in FusionEngineering and Design estimated it would cost around $5 billion. In 2015, that wasn’t much more than the cost of a comparably sized coal-fired plant, and one-eighth ITER’s price tag.

That May, Whyte gave a keynote about ARC at a fusion engineering symposium in Austin, Texas. Four of his students attended. When he described their plan for a workable reactor by 2025, in just 10 years, conferees were astounded—everyone else was talking decades. Afterward, the MIT contingent went to lunch at Stubb’s Bar-B-Q. It was clear that with the climate eroding and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that yet-­uninvented technologies were needed to keep temperatures from soaring into dreaded realms, they had to do this. But since the DOE had pulled its funding, how could they?

On a napkin, Whyte started listing what they’d need to do and what each step might cost. Over ribs, they crafted a proposal to spin off a startup to raise venture capital to finance a SPARC (for “soon-as-possible ARC”) demo fusion reactor to show that this could really happen. Then they’d build a commercial-scale ARC.

Forming a company would free them from academic and government funding cycles, but they were plasma physicists, most still in their 20s, without business backgrounds. Nevertheless, Whyte and Martin Greenwald, deputy director of the PSFC, agreed to join them, and in 2018 Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS, was born. Three of his former students would run the company, and three would remain at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which—in a profit-sharing agreement—would be CFS’s research arm.

They opened shop up the street, in The Engine, MIT’s “tough tech” startup incubator, and gained the attention of climate-concerned backers like Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeff Bezos. But they weren’t the only ones competing for fusion funds, and it became a race to see who could make commercial-scale fusion first.

The CFS team may have been young, but because of its partnership with MIT and its more than a hundred experienced fusion scientists, it had a running start.

By the end of 2021, Commonwealth Fusion Systems had raised more than $2 billion and was breaking ground on 47 acres outside Boston for a commercial fusion energy campus, to build SPARC by 2025—and commercial-scale, mass-­producible ARC by 2030.

Gaining and actually sustaining net energy is perpetually called fusion’s yet-unreached “holy grail,” but by September 2021, the CFS team of CEO Bob Mumgaard, SM ’15, PhD ’15 (a coauthor of the Vulcan design), chief science officer Brandon Sorbom, PhD ’17 (lead author of the 2015 fusion design class’s breakthrough paper), Whyte, and their 200 CFS colleagues were confident they could do it—if their magnets held. For three years, straight through the pandemic, they’d worked in PSFC’s West Cell laboratory, the cavernous former Oreo factory that had housed Alcator C-Mod, furiously solving problems like how to solder thin-film ReBCO tape together into a structure strong enough to withstand 40,000 amps passing through it—enough to power a small town.

The completed SPARC would have 18 magnets encircling its plasma chamber, but for this test they’d built just one. It was composed of 16 layers, each a D-shaped, 10-foot-high steel disk grooved like an LP. On one side, the grooves held tight spirals of ReBCO film, 270 kilometers in all—the distance from Boston to Albany. “Yet all that ReBCO holds just a sprinkling of rare earth,” said Sorbom. “That’s the magic of superconductors: A tiny bit of material can carry so much current. By comparison, a wind turbine’s rare-earth neodymium magnets weigh tons.”

On each disk’s flip side, the grooves channeled liquid helium to cool the superconductor for zero resistance. (The design dates to history’s first high-field magnet, built at MIT in the 1930s, which used copper conductors and water for coolant.) Each layer was built on an automated assembly line. “The idea,” said Mumgaard, “is to make 100,000 magnets a year someday. This can’t be a scientific curiosity. This needs to be an energy source.”

Although covid-19 had waned, an outbreak could foil everything, so they maintained coronavirus protocols, moving computer terminals outside beneath a tent to avoid crowding within. Others worked virtually. For a month, dozens worked eight-hour, continuous shifts. Some operated the electromagnetic coil, encased in stainless steel in the middle of the room, which over a week had to be gradually supercooled from room temperature of 298 K down to 20 K before slowly ramping up to full magnetic strength. Others constantly compared real-time data with redundant models. As the temperature dropped, the internal connections, welds, and valves contracted at different rates, so they watched for leaks.

On September 2, 2021, the Thursday before Labor Day, they started ramping up by a few kiloamps, stopping frequently to check what the current was revealing, how the cooling characteristics had changed, and how the stresses on the ReBCO coil increased as the magnetic field strengthened to record heights.

Two nights later, they cranked the amperage toward their goal: a 20-tesla magnetic field, powerful enough to lift 421 Boeing 747s or contain a continuous fusion reaction. They’d been aiming for 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, the 5th. At 3:30, the large screen in the design center showed that they’d reached 40 kiloamps, and the magnetic field had reached 19.56 tesla.

At 4:30 a.m., they were at 19.98 tesla. Things got very quiet. At 5:20 a.m., every redundant on-screen meter read 20 tesla, and nothing had leaked or exploded—except under the tent, where champagne corks were popping.

Five years earlier, on its final four-­second run, C-Mod’s copper-conducting magnet had consumed 200 million watts of energy to reach 5.7 tesla. This took 30 watts—less energy by a factor of around 10 million, Whyte told reporters—to produce a magnetic field strong enough to sustain a fusion reaction. The joints that transferred current from one layer to the next actually performed better than expected. That was the biggest unknown, because there was only one way to test them: in the magnet itself. They looked spectacular.

After five hours, the team ramped down the power. “It’s a Kitty Hawk moment,” Mumgaard said.

            <div id="article-text">Jaden Chizuruoke May ’29 worked with teammates Rihanna Arouna ’29 and Marian Akinsoji ’29 to design the chemically powered model car whose framework he is building in this scene from the Huang-Hobbs BioMaker Space, where students have a chance to work safely and independently with biological systems.

The assignment to build the car—and the layered electrochemical battery that powers it—came in a class called “Hands-On Engineering: Squishy Style Making with Biology and Chemistry” taught by the lab’s director, Justin Buck, PhD ’12. “It is definitely one of my favorite classes,” says May, who appreciates that after being trained, students are given the freedom to figure out how to tackle each task in a project.

Located in the basement of Building 26, the BioMaker Space welcomes novices and expert mentors alike, offering workshops in such things as bacterial photography, biobots, lateral flow assay, CRISPR, and DNA origami.

For May, the makerspace has been a hub for collaboration. “I could never have done anything in that lab without my peers and counselors helping me, and the emphasis placed on teamwork is what makes the class feel both welcoming and exciting,” he says, adding that he made some of his first friends at MIT there: “It has been a great introduction to campus.”

May says he’s thinking of double majoring in Course 10-ENG (energy) and Course 21W (writing)—but the class has gotten him interested in biology, too.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As MIT navigates a difficult and constantly changing higher education landscape, I believe our best response is not easy but simple: Keep doing our very best work. The presidential initiatives we’ve launched since fall 2024 are a vital part of our strategy to advance excellence within and across high-impact fields, from health care, climate, and education to AI and manufacturing—and now quantum. On December 8, we launched Quantum at MIT, or QMIT—the name rhymes with qubit, the basic unit of quantum information—to elevate MIT’s long-standing strengths in quantum science and engineering across computing, communication, and sensing.

More than 40 years ago, MIT helped kick off what is widely considered the second quantum revolution as host of the first Physics of Computation Conference at Endicott House, bringing together physics and computing researchers to explore the promise of quantum computing. Now we’re investing further in that promise.

Like all MIT’s strategic priorities, QMIT will help ensure that new technologies are used for the benefit of society. Faculty director Danna Freedman, the Frederick George Keyes Professor of Chemistry, is leading the initiative with a focus that extends beyond research and discovery to the way quantum technologies are developed and deployed. QMIT will enable scientists and engineers to co-develop quantum tools, generating unprecedented capabilities in science, technology, industry, and national security.

Although QMIT is a new initiative, it grew naturally from the Center for Quantum Engineering (CQE), created in 2019 to help bridge the gap between PIs at MIT and Lincoln Laboratory. A key to QMIT’s success will be integration with Lincoln Lab, with its deep and broad expertise in scaling and deployment.

And CQE has already gotten us started with industry collaborations through its Quantum Science and Engineering Consortium (QSEC), which brings together companies—from startups to large multinationals—that can help us realize positive, practical impact. We’re even envisioning a physical home for quantum at the heart of campus, a space for academic, industry, and public engagement with quantum systems.

As we set out for this new frontier, QMIT will allow us to shape the future of quantum, with a focus on solving “MIT-hard” problems. We hope that as the initiative evolves, our alumni and friends will be inspired to join us in supporting this exciting new effort to build on MIT’s quantum legacy.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <h2>Engineering’s AI reality check</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.
