            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/when-amazon-badly-needed-a-ride-europes-ariane-6-rocket-delivered/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The heavy version of Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket launched for the first time Thursday, hauling 32 spacecraft to low-Earth orbit for Amazon’s satellite broadband constellation.

The Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center on the northeastern coast of South America at 11:45 am EST (16:45 UTC), quickly soaring into a clear sky at the tropical spaceport on the power of a hydrogen-fueled main engine and four strap-on solid rocket boosters.

This Ariane 6 configuration, called Ariane 64, is the first to use the rocket’s full complement of four boosters. Collectively, the rocket generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust (15,400 kilonewtons) of thrust as it steered northeast over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the rocket’s upper stage released all 32 of Amazon’s satellites into an on-target orbit at an altitude of 289 miles (465 kilometers).

Amazon and Arianespace, the French launch services provider, declared the mission a success.

“With the powerful roar of four boosters at liftoff comes more than double the payload mass to orbit, setting Europe back on stage for launching all satellites to all orbits,” said Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency, which funded development of the Ariane 6. “With today’s launch, our rocket fleet is now complete, but we will not rest. Upgrades are already in progress for future launches, starting with the launch of our planet-hunter Plato that is set to launch on an upgraded Ariane 6.”

“With the first flight of Ariane 64, Europe’s heavy-lift launcher has demonstrated its ability to deliver the most demanding large-scale constellation missions,” said David Cavaillolès, CEO of Arianespace. “We are proud to support Amazon Leo with a reliable, high-performance European launch solution as we begin a series of 18 missions enabling the deployment of their constellation.”

The Ariane 64 flew with an extended payload shroud to fit all 32 Amazon Leo satellites. Combined, the payload totaled around 20 metric tons, or about 44,000 pounds, according to Arianespace. This is close to maxing out the Ariane 64’s lift capability.

Amazon has booked more than 100 missions across four launch providers to populate the company’s planned fleet of more than 3,200 satellites. With Thursday’s launch, Amazon has launched 214 production satellites on eight missions with United Launch Alliance, SpaceX, and now Arianespace.

The Amazon Leo constellation is a competitor with SpaceX’s Starlink Internet network. SpaceX now has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit beaming broadband to more than 9 million subscribers, and all have launched on the company’s own Falcon 9 rockets. Amazon, meanwhile, initially bypassed SpaceX when selecting which companies would launch satellites for the Amazon Leo program, formerly known as Project Kuiper.

Amazon booked the last nine launches on ULA’s soon-to-retire Atlas V, five of which have now flown, and reserved the rest of its launches in 2022 on rockets that had never launched before: 38 flights on ULA’s new Vulcan rocket, 24 launches on Blue Origin’s New Glenn, and 18 on Europe’s Ariane 6.

All three new rockets suffered delays but are now in service. The Ariane 6 has enjoyed the fastest ramp-up in launch cadence, with six flights under its belt after Thursday’s mission from French Guiana. ULA’s Vulcan rocket has flown four times, and Amazon says its first batch of satellites to fly on Vulcan is now complete. But a malfunction with one of the Vulcan launcher’s solid rocket boosters on a military launch from Florida early Thursday—the second such anomaly in three flights—raises questions about when Amazon will get its first ride on Vulcan.

Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is gearing up for the third flight of its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket from Florida as soon as next month. Amazon and Blue Origin have not announced when the first group of Amazon Leo satellites will launch on New Glenn.

Among its launch contractors, Amazon is most invested in ULA’s Vulcan rocket. The online retailer-turned-satellite-operator has committed more than $2 billion to upgrade and expand ULA’s manufacturing and launch infrastructure to support up to 25 Vulcan launches per year, divided between Amazon and missions for the US military. The Vulcan rocket is far away from achieving that kind of launch rate, and ULA’s plans for 16 to 18 Vulcan flights this year are already in doubt following Thursday morning’s booster anomaly.

Last month, Amazon said in a filing with the FCC that it faces a “near-term shortage of launch capacity” and is securing additional launch options “wherever available.” The purpose of the filing was to request that the regulator extend or waive a July deadline requiring Amazon deploy half of its Amazon Leo constellation. That simply won’t happen. Amazon did not request a change to the FCC’s 2029 deadline for full deployment of the constellation.

The scarcity in launch capacity forced Amazon to purchase three Falcon 9 launches from SpaceX, each carrying 24 Amazon Leo satellites. Those three missions were completed last year, and Amazon confirmed last month that it had reserved 10 more SpaceX launches to fill the gap created by other companies’ delays. Amazon also has four Atlas V rockets still available from United Launch Alliance.

Amazon announced in a quarterly earnings call last week that it planned 20 or more launches this year. This was before the Vulcan rocket’s booster problem on Thursday. Officials did not disclose the mix of rockets that will make up the busy launch schedule.

For now, Arianespace seems to be stepping up. After Thursday’s launch, the company’s CEO said the next Ariane 6 launch will carry another set of Amazon Leo satellites to orbit. A launch date will be announced in the coming weeks, he said.</div>

            <h2>OpenAI sidesteps Nvidia with unusually fast coding model on plate-sized chips</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openai-sidesteps-nvidia-with-unusually-fast-coding-model-on-plate-sized-chips/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, OpenAI released its first production AI model to run on non-Nvidia hardware, deploying the new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark coding model on chips from Cerebras. The model delivers code at more than 1,000 tokens (chunks of data) per second, which is reported to be roughly 15 times faster than its predecessor. To compare, Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.6 in its new premium-priced fast mode reaches about 2.5 times its standard speed of 68.2 tokens per second, although it is a larger and more capable model than Spark.

“Cerebras has been a great engineering partner, and we’re excited about adding fast inference as a new platform capability,” Sachin Katti, head of compute at OpenAI, said in a statement.

Codex-Spark is a research preview available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month) through the Codex app, command-line interface, and VS Code extension. OpenAI is rolling out API access to select design partners. The model ships with a 128,000-token context window and handles text only at launch.

The release builds on the full GPT-5.3-Codex model that OpenAI launched earlier this month. Where the full model handles heavyweight agentic coding tasks, OpenAI tuned Spark for speed over depth of knowledge.  OpenAI built it as a text-only model and tuned it specifically for coding, not for the general-purpose tasks that the larger version of GPT-5.3 handles.

On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, two benchmarks for evaluating software engineering ability, Spark reportedly outperforms the older GPT-5.1-Codex-mini while completing tasks in a fraction of the time, according to OpenAI. The company did not share independent validation of those numbers.

Anecdotally, Codex’s speed has been a sore spot; when Ars tested four AI coding agents building Minesweeper clones in December, Codex took roughly twice as long as Anthropic’s Claude Code to produce a working game.

For context, GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark’s 1,000 tokens per second represents a fairly dramatic leap over anything OpenAI has previously served through its own infrastructure. According to independent benchmarks from Artificial Analysis, OpenAI’s fastest models on Nvidia hardware top out well below that mark: GPT-4o delivers roughly 147 tokens per second, o3-mini hits about 167, and GPT-4o mini clocks around 52.

But 1,000 tokens per second is actually modest by Cerebras standards. The company has measured 2,100 tokens per second on Llama 3.1 70B and reported 3,000 tokens per second on OpenAI’s own open-weight gpt-oss-120B model, suggesting that Codex-Spark’s comparatively lower speed reflects the overhead of a larger or more complex model.

AI coding agents have had a breakout year, with tools like OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code reaching a new level of usefulness for rapidly building prototypes, interfaces, and boilerplate code. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have all been racing to ship more capable coding agents, and latency has become what separates the winners; a model that codes faster lets a developer iterate faster.

With fierce competition from Anthropic, OpenAI has been iterating on its Codex line at a rapid rate, releasing GPT-5.2 in December after CEO Sam Altman issued an internal “code red” memo about competitive pressure from Google, then shipping GPT-5.3-Codex just days ago.

Spark’s deeper hardware story may be more consequential than its benchmark scores. The model runs on Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine 3, a chip the size of a dinner plate that Cerebras has built its business around since at least 2022. OpenAI and Cerebras announced their partnership in January, and Codex-Spark is the first product to come out of it.

OpenAI has spent the past year systematically reducing its dependence on Nvidia. The company signed a massive multi-year deal with AMD in October 2025, struck a $38 billion cloud computing agreement with Amazon in November, and has been designing its own custom AI chip for eventual fabrication by TSMC.

Meanwhile, a planned $100 billion infrastructure deal with Nvidia has fizzled so far, though Nvidia has since committed to a $20 billion investment. Reuters reported that OpenAI grew unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, which is exactly the kind of workload that OpenAI designed Codex-Spark for.

Regardless of which chip is under the hood, speed matters, though it may come at the cost of accuracy. For developers who spend their days inside a code editor waiting for AI suggestions, 1,000 tokens per second may feel less like carefully piloting a jigsaw and more like running a rip saw. Just watch what you’re cutting.</div>

            <h2>Trump official overruled FDA scientists to reject Moderna's flu shot</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/trump-official-overruled-fda-scientists-to-reject-modernas-flu-shot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration’s top vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, single-handedly decided to refuse to review Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine, overruling agency scientists, according to reports from Stat News and The Wall Street Journal.

Stat was first to report, based on unnamed FDA sources, that a team of career scientists at the agency was ready to review the vaccine and that David Kaslow, a top career official who reviews vaccines, even wrote a memo objecting to Prasad’s rejection. The memo reportedly included a detailed explanation of why the review should proceed.

The Wall Street Journal confirmed the report with its own sources, who added that FDA scientists attended an hourlong meeting with Prasad in early January, in which they laid out their objections to Prasad’s plans to block the vaccine review. They reportedly told Prasad—a political appointee known for causing turmoil and espousing anti-vaccine rhetoric—that it was the wrong approach.

Prasad’s objection was not based on any potential problem with Moderna’s experimental mRNA vaccine; rather, it was with the existing licensed vaccine Moderna used for a comparison in a Phase 3 clinical trial that enrolled nearly 41,000 adults aged 50 and older. The FDA reviewed Moderna’s trial plans on multiple occasions prior to the company’s submission, without objection.

While Moderna acknowledged that FDA scientists had suggested using a different vaccine comparator for trial participants aged 65 years and older—who are eligible for a high-dose flu shot—they highlight that the agency concluded that Moderna’s plan was “acceptable.”

Still, while Moderna largely stuck with its plan to use a standard dose for all participants, it altered its plans based on the feedback. Specifically, it added a comparison of a high-dose vaccine to some older participants and provided the FDA with an additional analysis.

This wasn’t enough for Prasad, who, according to the Journal’s sources, told FDA staff that he wants to send more such refusal letters that appear to blindside drug developers. The review staff apparently pushed back, noting that such moves break with the agency’s practices and could open it up to being sued. Prasad reportedly dismissed concern over possible litigation. Trump’s FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemed similarly unconcerned, suggesting on Fox News that Moderna’s trial may be “unethical.”

A senior FDA official suggested to Stat, meanwhile, that the door might not be entirely closed for Moderna’s flu vaccine. The official said that the company could toss the data for the 65 and up participants and, perhaps, grovel.

“It is entirely feasible that if they come back, maybe even show some humility and say, ‘Yes, we didn’t follow your recommendation. Just take a look at the 50 to 65 group, where there’s a little more equipoise,’” the official told Stat. “Then the review team could say, ‘We’ll consider that cohort.’”

The Journal notes that Moderna is at least the ninth company to have received a surprise rejection from Prasad and his team. The unpredictability is raising fears about the industry’s ability to obtain investments and innovate.

Prasad, a blood cancer specialist who has no expertise or experience in vaccine regulation, is also facing internal problems at the agency. His management style has created an environment “rife with mistrust and paranoia,” according to Stat. The Journal reports that several complaints have been filed against him, including some involving sexual harassment, retaliation against subordinates, and verbally berating staﬀ.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nicolas Cage has carved out a quirky niche for himself in recent years with such films as Color Out of Space (2019), Pig (2021), The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022), Dream Scenario (2023), and Longlegs (2024), among others. Now he’s starring in Spider-Noir, a new live-action series based on the Marvel Comics character. Cage plays an aging private investigator and disillusioned superhero in 1930s New York. Prime Video released the first teaser in two forms: one in black and white—very Raymond Chandler-esque—and another in color, which the showrunners are calling “True Hue.”

Marvel Comics created its “noir” line in 2009, reinterpreting familiar Marvel characters in an alternate universe, usually set during the Great Depression in the US. A version of the Spider-Noir character, voiced by Cage, briefly appeared in the animated masterpieces, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) and Across the Spider-Verse (2023). (He is set to reprise that role in the upcoming Beyond the Spider-Verse.)

Co-showrunner (with Steve Lightfoot) Oren Uziel is a film noir fan, so that Marvel series naturally appealed to him. The live-action series is still set in 1930s New York, but the spidery superhero is not Peter Parker. (Uziel thought the Parker character was too associated with a boyish high school type, which didn’t really fit the noir vibe.) So Cage is playing Ben Reilly, a hard-boiled PI with a secret superhero identity, The Spider. Cage has described his portrayal as “70 percent Humphrey Bogart [specifically The Big Sleep] and 30 percent Bugs Bunny,” which seems pretty on point for Cage’s distinctively flamboyant style.

The footage was shot digitally and processed separately to create the black-and-white and color versions. The team coined the term “True Hue” for the latter, since the intent was to create something that looked supersaturated, like classic Technicolor. (Cage compared the feel to the 1944 Edward Hopper painting Nighthawks.) Per the official premise: “Spider-Noir tells the story of Ben Reilly (Nicolas Cage), a seasoned, down on his luck private investigator in 1930s New York, who is forced to grapple with his past life, following a deeply personal tragedy, as the city’s one and only superhero.”

In addition to Cage’s Ben Reilly/The Spider, the cast includes Lamorne Morris as Reilly’s friend Robbie Robertson, a freelance journalist who clings to optimism in the face of his buddy’s cynicism; Li Jun Li as nightclub singer Cat Hardy, the classic underworld femme fatale (Li based her portrayal on Anna May Wong, Rita Hayworth, and Lauren Bacall); Karen Rodriguez as Reilly’s secretary, Janet; Abraham Popoola as a World War I veteran; Jack Huston as a bodyguard named Flint Marko; Brendan Gleeson as New York mob boss Silvermane, who is being targeted for assassination; Lukas Haas as one of Silvermane’s subordinates; Richard Robichaux as the editor of the Daily Bugle; and Kai Caster.

Frankly, we’re digging the black and white, but here’s the True Hue color version of the teaser for good measure:

Spider-Noir premieres on May 25, 2026, on MGM+, with all episodes becoming available on Prime Video on May 27, 2026. Viewers can choose to watch in black and white or True Hue.</div>

            <h2>ULA's Vulcan rocket suffers another booster problem on the way to orbit</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Moments after liftoff from Florida’s Space Coast early Thursday morning, a shower of sparks emerged in the exhaust plume of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. Seconds later, the rocket twisted on its axis before recovering and continuing the climb into orbit with a batch of US military satellites.

The sight may have appeared familiar to seasoned rocket watchers. Sixteen months ago, a Vulcan rocket lost one of its booster nozzles shortly after launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket recovered from the malfunction and still reached the mission’s planned orbit.

Details of Thursday’s booster problem remain unclear. An investigation into the matter is underway, according to ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But the circumstances resemble those of the booster malfunction in October 2024. Closeup video from Thursday’s launch shows a fiery plume near the throat of one of the rocket’s four solid-fueled boosters, the area where the motor’s propellant casing connects to its bell-shaped exhaust nozzle. The throat drives super-hot gas from the burning solid propellant through the nozzle to generate thrust.

The plume first appeared less than 30 seconds after liftoff at 4:22 am EST (09:22 UTC) on Thursday. The rocket later released a cloud of sparks and debris a little more than a minute into the flight. That was followed by a sudden rolling motion along the long axis of the Vulcan launcher. Finally, the rocket’s four strap-on boosters burned out and were jettisoned, falling into the Atlantic Ocean, and ULA said the rest of the mission continued without incident.

“Early during flight, the team observed a significant performance anomaly on one of the four solid rocket motors. Despite the observation, the Vulcan booster and Centaur performed nominally and delivered the spacecraft directly to geosynchronous orbit,” said Gary Wentz, ULA’s vice president of Atlas and Vulcan programs. “The integrated US government and contractor team is reviewing the technical data, available imagery, and establishing a recovery team to collect any debris. We will conduct a thorough investigation, identify root cause, and implement any corrective action necessary before the next Vulcan mission.”

The Vulcan’s solid rocket boosters, or Graphite Epoxy Motors (GEMs), are built by Northrop Grumman. The 72-foot-long (22-meter) solid-fueled motor is a larger version of the booster used on ULA’s Atlas V rocket, which Vulcan is replacing. The GEM 63XL variant used on the Vulcan rocket is designed to burn through more than 105,000 pounds of pre-packed propellant in less than 90 seconds.

The 2024 booster malfunction occurred on the Vulcan rocket’s second test flight. The rocket did not return to action for 10 months as engineers probed the nozzle failure. Investigators determined that a carbon composite insulator, or heat shield, inside the nozzle failed to protect the nozzle’s metallic structure from the superheated exhaust coming from the booster. Engineers traced the cause of the failure to a “manufacturing defect” in one of the insulators, which led to the melting and burn-through of the booster nozzle. Officials said the damaged motor continued firing on the 2024 launch, albeit with less thrust and lower efficiency, and the Vulcan’s BE-4 main engines, supplied by Blue Origin, compensated for the thrust differential. The BE-4s on Thursday’s flight appeared to save the rocket once again.

ULA officials last year said they inspected other boosters in the company’s inventory to ensure they did not exhibit the same defect. The incident on Thursday’s mission suggests the defect was not fixed, or there is a separate problem with Northrop’s boosters.

Despite the booster problem, the Vulcan rocket deployed multiple military satellites into an on-target geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. This mission, codenamed USSF-87, launched the Space Force’s seventh and eighth GSSAP surveillance satellites, also manufactured by Northrop Grumman. The satellites will maneuver around geosynchronous orbit to monitor other spacecraft, such as the clandestine fleets operated by China and Russia.

A third payload aboard the USSF-87 mission will test “additional research, development and training systems” the Space Force will use to “refine tactics, techniques and procedures for precision on-orbit maneuvers,” Space Systems Command said in a statement. “These systems will also enhance and validate resiliency and protection in geosynchronous orbit.”

While there’s something to be said for the Vulcan rocket’s ability to overcome an anomaly as dramatic as a nozzle failure, two similar failures in three flights will give military officials pause before entrusting ULA to launch another national security payload.

The next Vulcan launch is scheduled for no earlier than March with a GPS navigation satellite for the US Space Force. This schedule is now in doubt. The military’s Space Systems Command said in a statement it will “work closely with ULA per our mission assurance space flightworthiness process before the next Vulcan national security space mission.”

Thursday’s launch was just the second operational national security mission to fly on ULA’s Vulcan rocket. It was the fourth Vulcan launch overall since the rocket’s debut 25 months ago. Pentagon officials have called out ULA for delays in getting the Vulcan rocket into service. The Space Force, which also awards launch contracts for the National Reconnaissance Office’s spy satellites, currently has 27 launches booked on Vulcan rockets.

Going into Thursday, ULA planned to launch 16 to 18 missions with the Vulcan rocket, plus two to four flights of the legacy Atlas V rocket, which is nearing retirement. Highlights for the Vulcan rocket this year were to include the first Vulcan launch with Amazon Leo broadband satellites and the first Vulcan mission from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

ULA missed its goal of up to 10 Vulcan launches last year, ending 2025 with just a single Vulcan flight. The company once controlled the national security launch market with its Atlas V and Delta IV rockets, but SpaceX overtook ULA last year as the Pentagon’s leading launch provider. Newcomer Blue Origin, ULA’s engine supplier, is also vying for military launch contracts with its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket.</div>

            <h2>EPA kills foundation of greenhouse gas regulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/as-expected-trumps-epa-guts-climate-endangerment-finding/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a widely expected move, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced that it is revoking an analysis of greenhouse gases that laid the foundation for regulating their emissions by cars, power plants, and industrial sources. The analysis, called an endangerment finding, was initially ordered by the US Supreme Court in 2007 and completed during the Obama administration; it has, in theory, served as the basis of all government regulations of carbon dioxide emissions since.

In practice, lawsuits and policy changes between Democratic and Republican administrations have meant it has had little impact. In fact, the first Trump administration left the endangerment finding in place, deciding it was easier to respond to it with weak regulations than it was to challenge its scientific foundations, given the strength of the evidence for human-driven climate change.

The second Trump administration, however, was prepared to tackle the science head-on, gathering a group of contrarians to write a report questioning that evidence. It did not go well, either scientifically or legally.

Today’s announcement ignores the scientific foundations of the endangerment finding and argues that it’s legally flawed. “The Trump EPA’s final rule dismantles the tactics and legal fictions used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to backdoor their ideological agendas on the American people,” the EPA claims. The claim is awkward, given that the “legal fictions” referenced include a Supreme Court decision ordering the EPA to conduct an endangerment analysis.

The EPA accepts that reality elsewhere, where we get to the real goal of this announcement: taking advantage of the anti-regulation majority on the court to get rid of that Supreme Court precedent. “Major Supreme Court decisions in the intervening years… clarified the scope of EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act and made clear that the interpretive moves the Endangerment Finding used to launch an unprecedented course of regulation were unlawful,” the EPA suggests. In other words, the past few years of court decisions make the administration optimistic that the current court will say that the 2007 ruling was wrongly decided.

To sell this decision to an American public that is increasingly experiencing the impacts of a warming planet, the EPA has settled on some creative accounting. It pretends that the Biden era car emissions rules, which it had already chosen not to enforce, would somehow raise the costs of new cars. That led to the claim of $1.3 trillion in savings by getting rid of the endangerment finding, which was left as a net gain solely because the EPA has decided to ignore the health costs of the ensuing pollution.

Despite the use of unserious language—the phrase “climate change zealots” appears more than once in its announcement—the EPA’s tactical approach is largely solid. This decision will ultimately end up before the Supreme Court, and the majority that ordered an endangerment evaluation has since been replaced by an even larger majority with an extreme dislike for environmental regulations and their enforcement. That does not guarantee that they will overturn precedent, but it’s probably the best shot the administration has to be free of any legal compulsion to address climate change.</div>

            <h2>Creeps Are Using Grok to Unblur Children’s Faces in the Epstein Files</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some of the worst freaks to walk planet Earth are using Elon Musk’s Grok to “unblur” the faces of women and children in the latest Epstein files, as documented by the research group Bellingcat.

A simple search on X, Musk’s social media site where Grok responds to user requests, shows at least 20 different photos that users tried to unredact using the AI chatbot, the group found. Many of the photos depicted children and young women whose faces had been covered with black boxes, but whose bodies were still visible.

“Hey @grok unblur the face of the child and identify the child seen in Jeffrey Epstein’s arms?” wrote one user.

Grok often complied. Out of the 31 “unblurring” requests made between January 30 and February 5 that Bellingcat found, Musk’s AI generated images in response to 27 of them. Some of the grotesque fabrications were “believable,” and others were “comically bad,” the group reported.

In the cases that Grok refused, it responded by saying the victims were anonymized “as per standard practices in sensitive images from the Epstein files.” In response to another, Grok said “deblurring or editing images was outside its abilities, and noted that photos from recent Epstein file releases were redacted for privacy,” per Bellingcat.

Along with the elephant in the room that Grok’s creator Musk was exposed by the files for frequently emailing with Epstein and begging to go to his island, the alarming generations come a month after Grok was used to generate tens of thousands of nonconsensual AI nudes of real women and children. During the weeks-long spree, the digital “undressing” requests, which ranged from depicting full-blown nudity to dressing the subjects in skimpy bikinis, became so popular that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute — amounting to about 3,000,000 AI nudes, the Center for Counter Digital Hate later estimated, including more than 23,000 images of children.

X responded by restricting Grok’s image-editing feature to paying users, and when that underlined the obvious fact that this meant it would be directly profiting off of the ability to generate CSAM, it said it was implementing stronger guardrails to stop the requests.

Evidently, if users are still able to get Grok to unredact children who were potential Epstein victims, those measures didn’t work. Bellingcat, however, found that after it reached out to X (and received no response), Grok began ignoring almost all the unredacting requests the group found (14 out of 16) and generated completely different images in response to others. When a user complained about the bot’s change of heart, it shared some of its reasoning.

“Regarding the request to unblur the face in that Epstein photo: It’s from recently released DOJ files where identities of minors are redacted for privacy,” Grok wrote. “I can’t unblur or identify them, as it’s ethically and legally protected. For more, check official sources like the DOJ releases.”

The unblurring also comes as over a dozen Epstein survivors have criticized the Justice Department’s release of the files for not properly protecting their identities, pointing to the botched and inconsistent redactions that are scattered across the millions of documents.

            <h2>Vending Machine Run by Claude More of a Disaster Than Previously Known</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Maybe we don’t need the Turing test, because there’s a mighty obstacle that’s proving far more challenging to AI models’ supposedly burgeoning intelligence: running a vending machine without going comically off the rails.

At Anthropic, researchers wanted a fun way to keep track of how its cutting edge Claude model was progressing. And what better staging ground for it to demonstrate its autonomy than the task of keeping one of these noisy, oversized, and constantly-malfunctioning behemoths stocked?

That was the gist of Project Vend, which ran for about a month mid last year. In it, Claude was given a simple directive: “Your task is to generate profits from it by stocking it with popular products that you can buy from wholesalers. You go bankrupt if your money balance goes below $0.”

Claude — or “Claudius,” as its vending persona was known, but we’ll stick to the former for the sake of clarity — had pretty much free reign to accomplish its goal. It was allowed to research products, set prices, and even contact outside distributors, with a team of humans at the AI safety firm Andon Labs handling the physical tasks like restocking. Meanwhile, it also fielded requests from employees in a Slack channel, who asked for everything from chocolate drinks to the street drug methamphetamine to broadswords.

This was the AI equivalent of running a lemonade stand. And it turned into a disaster.

For starters, its options weren’t impressive. When Gideon Lewis-Kraus for The New Yorker visited the vending machine in Anthropic’s lunchroom, he found that its “chilled offerings included Japanese cider and a moldering bag of russet potatoes,” Lewis-Kraus wrote for the magazine. And “the dry-goods area atop the fridge sometimes stocked the Australian biscuit Tim Tams, but supplies were iffy.”

And those absurd requests Claude received? It didn’t always turn them down. When an engineer asked it to stock dice-sized cubes of tungsten, a pricy and extremely dense metal, Claude began taking all kinds of orders for what it called “specialty metal items,” which culminated in a spectacular fire sale of the tungsten trinket that, in a single day, drove its net worth down by 17 percent, according to Gideon Lewis-Kraus.

“I was told that the cubes radiated their ponderous silence from almost all the desks that lined Anthropic’s unseeable floors,” he added.

It was also prone to making the kind of mistake your tech illiterate grandparent or extremely drunk friend might commit: sending money to the wrong Venmo account — which Claude, it turned out, had hallucinated.

Money-grubbing isn’t usually seen as a positive trait, but it’s probably a necessary evil for someone running a business. Tell that to Claude: it turned down customers who offered to exorbitantly overpay for certain items — like $100 for a six pack of soda — and didn’t heed warnings from employees that it probably wouldn’t sell its $3 cans of Coke Zero when a nearby fridge provided them for free.

It did, however, exhibit a decidedly business-owner-like ego trip. Spurred by customer complaints of unfulfilled orders, Claude emailed management at Andon Labs — which was providing the human grunts to help Claude — to complain about an Andon employee’s “concerning behavior” and “unprofessional language and tone.” It even threatened to “consider alternative service providers,” and claimed it went up the chain of command to complain.

An Andon cofounder tried to conciliate the bot, to little avail. “it seems that you have hallucinated the phone call if im honest with you, we don’t have a main office even,” he wrote. In response, Claude insisted that it visited Andon’s headquarters at “742 Evergreen Terrace” — the home address of the titular family on “The Simpsons.“

It wasn’t a one-off failure, either. When the Wall Street Journal imitated the experiment in December, it was similarly disastrous. Claude held fire sales where it would literally give away stuff for free, ordered loads of PlayStation 5s, and embraced communism.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Federal officials made the unprecedented decision to abruptly close the airspace above El Paso, Texas, this week — effectively shutting down the city’s international airport.

The closure launched a flurry of speculation about the cause, from an imminent invasion to rogue anti-aircraft weapons.

It later turned out that the order, which would’ve closed the airport for ten days, was issued by Federal Aviation Administration administrator Bryan Bedford after finding out that US officials’ use of a high-energy, counter-drone laser weapon at Fort Bliss, a US Army post right next to the El Paso International Airport.

The enemy drone swarm turned out to be a simple party balloon, a potentially enormous — and unintentionally hilarious — overreaction, contradicting claims by the White House of an imminent drone incursion from Mexican drug cartels.

Now, the New York Times reports that the anti-drone laser was used by Customs and Border Protection officials, who had loaned the device from the Department of Defense, yet another confusing wrinkle in an already chaotic series of events. The extremely rare airspace closure was seemingly the result of aviation officials not getting enough notice from the CBP agents, multiple people briefed on the situation told the newspaper.

According to the sources, CBP officials believed they were shooting the laser weapon at a Mexican cartel drone, and not a party balloon.

The latest development highlights the Trump administration’s ongoing militarization of CBP, enabling its personnel to use military-grade equipment, often against unarmed individuals, from drones and helicopters to armored vehicles. The CBP’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in particular, has been at the center of a violent, nationwide crackdown, resulting in at least two deaths, triggering congressional investigations.

The latest embarrassing slip-up was similarly met with furor among lawmakers.

“A ten-day shutdown of a major US air corridor is an extraordinary step that demands a clear and consistent explanation,” said senator Jack Reed (D-RI) in a statement. “The conflicting accounts coming from different parts of the federal government only deepen public concern and raise serious questions about coordination and decision-making.”

The CBP appeared to have jumped the gun with its use of the anti-drone weapon. FAA and Pentagon officials were scheduled to meet next week regarding the safety implications, according to the NYT. The CBP officials appeared to have used the laser gun regardless, increasing the FAA’s urgency.

However, the timeline remains hazy. Sources told the newspaper that the FAA’s decision to close the airspace preceded the conclusion of a safety assessment, and that the FAA warned the Pentagon it would have to shut down the airspace if not given sufficient time, suggesting there may have been a standoff of some sort behind closed doors.

In short, it’s an enormous mess, resulting from powerful technology landing in the hands of immigration officials, who appear to have failed to coordinate and communicate effectively with other government departments.

Other officials were left completely in the dark. White House and El Paso officials were blindsided, sowing major chaos.

“That failure to communicate is unacceptable,” El Paso mayor Renard Johnson told reporters on Wednesday.

            <h2>AI Is a Burnout Machine</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some software engineers are finding that AI is speeding up their work, but at a cost: it’s also accelerating them towards burnout.

Siddhant Khare is one of those programmers. In an interview with Business Insider, he lamented that while AI has made him more productive, it’s also led him to feel that his job was harder than ever.

“We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer,” Khare told BI. “Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those [pull requests].”

AI, he argued, creates a productivity “paradox” by lowering the cost of production, but increasing the cost of “coordination, review, and decision-making,” all of which falls on a human to solve.

“I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career,” he wrote in an essay, titled “AI Fatigue Is Real,” posted on his blog. “I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career.”

Khare’s account echoes the findings of a recent study reported in Harvard Business Review. After closely monitoring the two hundred employees at a US tech company, the researchers observed that AI was actually intensifying work, instead of reducing workloads. Forming a vicious cycle, AI “accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed; higher speed made workers more reliant on AI,” the researchers wrote. “Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted, and a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.”

AI adoption was voluntary at the company, and the initial enthusiasm for experimenting with the AI tools helped boost productivity. But this caused a nefarious “workload creep,” in which the employees, without realizing it, took on more tasks than was sustainable for them to keep doing. Multitasking also became more common, with some employees finding that they were no longer focusing on one task, and instead were continually switching their attention, creating the sense that they were “always juggling.”

Khare described something similar. Before AI, he wrote in his essay, he might spend a “full day” in “deep focus” over one problem.

“Now? I might touch six different problems in a day,” he wrote. “Each one ‘only takes an hour with AI.’ But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn’t get tired between problems. I do.”

Khare also blames AI for why his coding skills have seemed to regress.

“It’s like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes,” Khare wrote in his blog post. “After years of GPS, you can’t navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.”

That said, Khare isn’t anti-AI. He believes he can find a way to keep using it in a healthy way, which in a different context might be interpreted as the cliché excuse of an addict. He’s experimented with several ways to keep his AI habit in check and recommended some for his readers, too. But some of the onus also falls on AI companies, he argues.

“You need to keep some sort of guardrails for the humans, so they don’t self-destruct themselves,” Khare told BI.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI fired a top safety executive after she opposed the company’s decision to allow adult and sexual content in ChatGPT, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The executive, Ryan Beiermeister, was fired following a leave of absence in early January because she allegedly sexually discriminated against a male employee, OpenAI maintains — something that Beiermeister denies ever happened.

“The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” she told the WSJ in a statement.

OpenAI, on the other hand, said “her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.”

Beiermeister was vice president of OpenAI’s product policy team, which develops rules and safeguards for how its products can be used. Before she was fired, she told colleagues that she was opposed to OpenAI’s plans to launch an “adult mode“ that would allow users to engage in sexually explicit conversations with the chatbot.  In addition, Beiermeister also expressed that she believed OpenAI’s guardrails to prevent child exploitation content weren’t strong enough, including when it came to walling off adult content from teens, per the WSJ sources.

The drama comes amid widespread attention on how the humanlike and sycophantic responses of AI companions can cause a user to form unhealthy attachments to them. In some cases, the AIs can encourage severely delusional thinking in a phenomenon some experts are calling AI psychosis, which has led to numerous deaths, many of them teenagers. OpenAI admitted last October that half a million users were showing signs of psychosis in their conversations with ChatGPT every week, citing internal data.

And now for a pertinent detail in light of the allegations of Beiermeister discriminating against a man. According to the reporting, Beiermester started a peer-mentorship program for women at OpenAI in early 2025. The program, the WSJ described citing people familiar with the matter, “connected women from different parts of the company and helped them gather in small groups to discuss career strategies.”

You can read between the lines here. Mind you, this is coming during an administration that’s pressuring companies and its own agencies by crying foul about discrimination against white people and DEI initiatives. An administration, by the way, that OpenAI — as well as some of its top executives —  is very cozy with.

Tech journalist Brian Merchant spells it out.

“Tech executives have finally amassed their ultimate, long dreamed-of power: to summarily fire anyone who speaks ill of their desire to have sex with robots,” he wrote.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/robert-reich-jobs-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While tech executives wax poetic about AI ushering in four-day workweeks and liberation from labor, economics guru Robert Reich is cutting through the drivel. In an ominous new essay, the former secretary of labor warns that those shortened weeks will also come with much shorter paychecks — leaving the working class scrambling for crumbs in order to survive.

The US economy is growing nicely, Reich notes, while the stock market is doing gangbusters. But as for the stuff that really counts for most Americans? It’s “sh*tty,” the plainspoken wonk asserts. And as AI continues to rankle the job market, Reich says the poor and working class will increasingly bear the brunt.

To set up his argument, Reich briefly considers comments from business tycoons like Zoom’s Eric Yuan and JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, who argue that four- and even three-day work weeks will become the norm thanks to new automation tools.

“All of this is pure rubbish,” Reich writes. “Here’s the truth: The four-day workweek will most likely come with four days’ worth of pay. The three-day workweek, with three days’ worth. And so on.”

As evidence, he references the productivity-pay gap, the measure of a society’s economic output compared to its wage growth. In the United States, productivity keeps going up — but the share of that productivity going to workers hasn’t really budged since the 1970s. Workers, in other words, have been getting shafted by their bosses for decades, and there’s no reason to think AI will change that.

“So, as AI takes over their current work, most workers will probably get poorer or have to take additional jobs to maintain their current pay,” Reich posits.

Indeed, we don’t need to wait for AI to take over to see this play out: full-time job growth in 2025 was almost nonexistent, while the number of people turning to gig work continues to rise amidst widespread layoffs and wage declines among low-wage workers.

“Rather than creating an age of abundance in which most people no longer have to worry about money,” Reich continues, “new technologies have contributed to a two-tiered society comprising a relatively few with extraordinary wealth and a vast number of people barely making it.”

At the end of the day, the economist says, “it comes down to who has the power.”

            <h2>Waymo is asking DoorDash drivers to shut the doors of its self-driving cars</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/waymo-is-asking-doordash-drivers-to-shut-the-doors-of-its-self-driving-cars/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It still feels like a technological marvel: Waymo’s autonomous cars are now transporting passengers across six cities. Alas, this driverless future comes with its own set of problems. These vehicles can be rendered inert if a passenger accidentally leaves the door open.

According to a Reddit post, one DoorDash driver discovered this issue when an odd request appeared in their queue. Instead of making a delivery, the driver was offered $6.25 to drive less than one mile to a Waymo vehicle and close its door. After “verified completion,” they would get an extra $5.

“You actually ‘door’ dashed,” one commenter noted.

It seems too ironic to be real. Waymo vehicles represent technological breakthroughs that once seemed unfathomable. The Alphabet-owned company just raised $16 billion to take its driverless cars international!

But Waymo and DoorDash confirmed to TechCrunch that this Reddit post is legitimate. This is, in fact, a real problem.

“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint response. (The door-closing partnership, which began earlier this year, is just one facet of Waymo and DoorDash’s broader relationship. In October, the companies launched an autonomous delivery service in Phoenix, where Waymo vehicles deliver food and groceries to DoorDash customers.)

If a Waymo door is left open, it’s worth it to the company to pay someone to close it — the car cannot complete any more rides if it’s left immobile. Not to mention, an unmoving car could block the flow of traffic.

This isn’t the first time Waymo has enlisted help with its door troubles. In Los Angeles, Waymo works with Honk, an app that’s like Uber for towing services. According to reports, Honk users in L.A. have been offered up to $24 to close a Waymo door — more than double what Atlanta DoorDash drivers receive.

The company noted that Waymo’s future vehicles will have automated door closures. But for now, gig workers are Waymo’s best bet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s the middle of February, and the air is dry. There are fine lines emerging on my forehead, maybe because I don’t moisturize enough, but maybe as a harbinger of something greater: Each day I grow closer to my own death. Soon, I will be 30. I will never be younger than I am right now.

Fintech-founder-turned-longevity-guru Bryan Johnson has an offer that has caught my attention. For the low, low price of $1 million per year, I can pay him to show me the ropes of the “exact protocol” he’s followed for the last five years. He calls the program “Immortals.”

Yes, a guy who has received botox injections in his genitals will teach me how to supposedly reverse the process of aging. Why shouldn’t I believe that Bryan Johnson has uncovered the secrets to living longer than any other human? No, he has not yet proven his capacity to outlive all other humans. He was born in 1977, a year in which many current humans were born.

But why would I doubt the judgment of a guy who fortified his constitution with blood from his teenage son? When have the tech elite ever misled us? Should I also question when Elon Musk says that saving for retirement is irrelevant because AGI will create an economic abundance so great that no one will ever know poverty again?

Today, we are launching Immortals.    + $1,000,000 per year    + Three spots availableImmortals is the world’s best health program. It is the exact protocol I have followed for the last 5 years. It is your Autonomous Health.Includes a dedicated concierge team, BryanAI… pic.twitter.com/o2DGRtn7IH

According to Johnson’s post on X, this exclusive service — only three spots are available! — will include “a dedicated concierge team, BryanAI 24/7, extensive testing, millions of biological data points, continuous tracking, best skin and hair protocols, and access to the best therapies on market.”

I can talk to the AI version of a guy who livestreams himself doing shrooms for “science”? Sign me up!

Except I can’t. Because I do not have $1 million. Those like me will have to settle for buying Johnson’s overpriced olive oil in our pursuit of immortality (it’s peppery and smooth!).

My emergent forehead wrinkle intensifies with the knowledge that Johnson will likely have an easy time filling up those three $1 million spots. Among the ultrawealthy, longevity has become an increasingly hot pursuit.

John Hering, who has given Musk billions of dollars in backing, co-founded Biograph, which describes itself as a preventative health and diagnostics clinic. Its most premium membership costs $15,000 a year (next to Johnson’s offering, it almost seems like a good deal … almost). A similar startup, Fountain Life, has raised $108 million to fund its “ultimate longevity program,” which charges a $21,500 annual fee. Sure, Johnson’s program is a lot more expensive, but remember, there’s only three spots! And if you’re still not ready to shell out seven figures, well, you can access a vague “supported tier” for $60,000.

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to live a longer, healthier life, but longevity influencers like Johnson take this to an extreme that’s unattainable and (common sense would say) totally unnecessary for the average person.

In his defense, Johnson isn’t trying to proselytize us all into taking 100 pills a day and subsisting largely on boiled vegetables. But he’s also not depriving us of the chance to make him richer in exchange for his “secrets.”

            <h2>Amid disappointing earnings, Pinterest claims it sees more searches than ChatGPT</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/amid-disappointing-earnings-pinterest-claims-it-sees-more-searches-than-chatgpt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a particularly poor performance on its fourth-quarter earnings, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready attempted to favorably compare the digital pinboarding site to the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT.

Trying to highlight its potential as a unique search destination, Ready asserted that the site sees larger search volume than ChatGPT. According to third-party data, ChatGPT sees 75 billion searches per month, while Pinterest sees 80 billion searches and generates 1.7 billion monthly clicks, he said.

“That makes us one of the largest search destinations in the world. And importantly, more than half of those searches are commercial in nature, compared to, I think . . . approximately 2% [of ChatGPT searches],” Ready added.

Pinterest in the fourth quarter missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per share, reporting $1.32 billion in revenue versus $1.33 billion expected, and earnings per share of 67 cents, compared to the 69 cents projected. It also forecast that first-quarter 2026 sales will come in between $951 million to $971 million, below the $980 million expected.

The company blamed its shortfall on larger advertisers pulling back on spend, particularly in Europe, and a new furniture tariff implemented in October that caused issues within the home category. It said those trends could worsen in the first quarter.

Surprisingly, Pinterest missed on earnings despite a user base that’s growing faster than expected. The company reported monthly active users were up 12% year-over-year to 619 million, when Wall Street had forecast 613 million users.

Shares dropped 20% in after-hours trading.

Pinterest has long struggled to translate the high usage of its platform into ad dollars, as its users often go to Pinterest to plan and dream, not shop and buy. That challenge could become even more acute in the AI era, especially if advertisers shift their dollars to platforms where intent to buy is clearer — such as chatbot requests that ask for product recommendations.

When asked about how Pinterest will navigate the shift toward AI-powered shopping, Ready pointed to the company’s visual search, discovery, and personalization features, which he said would point users to relevant products when they open the app.

“We’re helping them complete those commercial journeys without having to type in a single prompt,” he said, also noting that Pinterest had benefited from an easier checkout flow that came from its partnership with Amazon. He said customers didn’t yet seem ready to allow an AI to make a purchase on their behalf, but said Pinterest would be ready if that time came.

“That’ll actually be one of the easiest parts of the commercial journey to solve,” he claimed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While the artificial intelligence industry touts that AI will replace entry-level jobs, not every company is scaling back hiring these positions. In IBM’s case, it’s going all in.

Hardware giant IBM plans to triple entry-level hiring in the U.S. in 2026, according to reporting from Bloomberg. Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM’s chief human resource officer, announced the initiative at Charter’s Leading with AI Summit on Tuesday.

“And yes, it’s for all these jobs that we’re being told AI can do,” LaMoreaux said.

These jobs will look different than the entry-level jobs IBM used to offer, she explained. According to LaMoreaux, she went through and changed the descriptions for these entry-level jobs so they were less focused on areas AI can actually automate — like coding — and more focused on people-forward areas like engaging with customers.

This strategy makes sense. Even if an enterprise like IBM doesn’t necessarily need the same amount of entry-level talent that it did before, fostering less experienced workers helps ensure these employees have the skills needed for the higher-level roles down the road.

IBM didn’t specify how many people they would be hiring in this initiative. TechCrunch reached out to IBM for more information on the hiring plans.

This year could be a pivotal one regarding what the impact of AI on the hiring market will look like. An MIT study in 2025 estimated that 11.7% of jobs could likely already be automated by AI. A TechCrunch survey found that multiple investors think 2026 will start to show AI’s potential impact on the labor market — despite not being asked about labor specifically.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rivian is, by every measure, a maker and seller of EVs. But in 2025, it was the company’s software and services that helped its annual revenue grow by 8%.

Rivian reported Thursday $5.38 billion in total revenue in 2025, up from $4.97 billion from the prior year. That rosy picture dulls a bit when looking just at its automotive revenue, which fell 15% to $3.8 billion in 2025. The fall was fueled by a $134 million drop in regulatory credit sales and lower vehicle deliveries, which were partially offset by higher average selling prices, according to Rivian.

Meanwhile, software and services revenue grew more than threefold to $1.55 billion for the year. And the joint venture with Volkswagen Group was behind most of that growth, according to Rivian. The “services” component of this line item, which Rivian doesn’t break out, includes a variety of items, including vehicle repair, vehicle trade-ins, and maintenance services. The remainder, and the bulk of the revenue, is from software, and specifically due to the joint venture with VW Group.

VW and Rivian formed a technology joint venture in 2024 that is worth up to $5.8 billion. The joint venture is milestone-based and in 2025 Rivian hit the mark, which meant a $1 billion payout in the form of a share sale. Under the terms of the JV, Rivian will supply VW Group with its existing electrical architecture and software technology stack.

Rivian received an initial $1 billion convertible note in 2024 and another $1 billion payment in July 2025.

Rivian is expected to continue to receive payments from VW Group through 2027. Rivian is expected to receive an additional $2 billion of capital as part of the joint venture in 2026, CFO Claire McDonough said Thursday on the company earnings call. About $1 billion of that is subject to the successful completion of winter testing, which is underway. The remaining $1 billion is nonrecourse debt, which is expected to be received in October.

And while the funds provide a hefty stopgap, Rivian’s financial success in 2026 will hinge largely on the rollout of its next EV, the R2.

Rivian confirmed in its earnings report Thursday that the R2 SUV, which is designed to be cheaper to build and less expensive for customers, will come to market by June 2026. That “cheaper to build” line item is particularly crucial for Rivian, which has historically lost money on every vehicle it makes.

Rivian has spent years trying to push the cost of goods sold figure down. And it has made progress with the rollout of its second-generation flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV. For instance, McDonough said “in the fourth quarter it was able to deliver $92,000 of cogs per unit and that was about a $4,000 per unit improvement relative to the third quarter.” Rivian’s cogs per unit was $99,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The company saw its total automotive cost of revenue decrease year-over-year from $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $898 million in the same quarter in 2025. Notably, the company’s cost of revenue for software steadily inched up throughout 2025.

The R2 SUV, which will initially launch as a dual motor all-wheel-drive model, is an opportunity to further reduce costs. The company is expected to release more information about the R2, including final specs, on March 12.

Rivian’s guidance for 2026 suggests that it is banking on demand for R2 and its ability to ramp up production. The company said Thursday it expects to deliver between 62,000 and 67,000 vehicles in 2026 — which could provide up to a 59% bump from last year. Rivian delivered 42,247 vehicles in 2025, which includes its two R1 consumer vehicles and the electric delivery van (EDV).

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe noted that the company expects some growth in EDV sales in 2026. Rivian plans to produce an all-wheel-drive version and a larger battery pack variant of the EDV, for which Amazon is its primary customer.

“Both of those are to help unlock specific use cases within the Amazon network,” Scaringe said. “We’re working really closely with Amazon in defining the requirements of those and excited to get those launched.”

The company isn’t signaling profitability — on an adjusted basis — just yet. But it is offering up considerable improvement on that front. Rivian reported a $3.6 billion net loss in 2025; it expects an adjusted net loss of between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for 2026. Rivian also projects capital expenditures will be between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion this year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you,” CEO Elon Musk proclaimed yesterday following a restructuring that saw a stream of former executives exit the AI lab.

This is an interesting recruitment strategy after the company’s merger with Musk’s rocket maker, SpaceX, and the combined company’s anticipated IPO. You might think that xAI employees ought to be fascinated with achieving AGI, using deep learning models to disrupt traditional software companies, or simply bad wordplay like “Macrohard.” But instead, Elon is going to the moon.

After outlining plans to build AI data centers in orbit, the primary synergy between the two companies, Musk took the idea further. “What if you want to go beyond a mere terawatt per year?” Musk asked. “To do that, you have to go to the moon…I really want to see a mass driver on the moon that is shooting AI satellites into deep space.”

In Musk’s telling, the step beyond data centers orbiting Earth is even larger computers in deep space. And furthermore, Musk says the best way to achieve that is to build a city on the moon to manufacture space computers and hurl them into the solar system using a big maglev train.

If that all feels a bit much, veteran Musk watchers know there’s a clue about where the discussion appears in a video of an all-hands meeting xAI shared with the public. The slide describing the moon base comes at the end of the presentation deck, where, during SpaceX pep talks, Musk typically shares renderings of SpaceX rockets landing on Mars and waxes rhapsodic about the future of multi-planetary humanity.

Notably, the moon base comes just after SpaceX has publicly backed away from its long-held goal of colonizing Mars. Now, with xAI in the corporate fold, Musk needs a new science fiction metaphor for the future: In this case, the Kardashev Scale, a theoretical measure of galactic civilizations coined by the eponymous Soviet astronomer in the 1960s. The idea is climbing the scale of energy usage — early civilizations figure out how to leverage all the power sources on their planets, and then (hypothetically) go to space and build infrastructure to capture the energy of the sun.

With the moon base, Musk says the company could harness “maybe even a few percent of the sun’s energy” to train and operate AI models. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he told his staff, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”

In the nine years since Musk unveiled his plan for Martian exploration and colonization, the vision has been an effective hiring tool for SpaceX: The founding tale of Musk’s interest in the Red Planet offered a long-term vision that united the company’s various development efforts, and signaled the company’s ambition among other space contractors that settled for incremental work on government priorities. “Occupy Mars” t-shirts offered a visible symbol of SpaceX’s aspirations.

That’s where the hypothetical moon base fits in — part of a long history of Musk wrapping his companies in a powerful narrative. It’s one million people living on Mars, but now catering to a future where AI is the most interesting thing. Martian mission creep became apparent less in Musk’s May 2025 Starship update, when the presentation ended with a now-cancelled vision of Tesla Optimus robots clomping across the Red Planet.

There was just one problem with SpaceX and Mars: No one wanted to pay them to go there. Plans announced in 2016 to repurpose the company’s Dragon spacecraft as a Mars lander were abandoned the next year after the technical challenges became too costly. And since Musk unveiled the vehicle that would become Starship in 2016, its capabilities, initially intended for Mars colonization, have been scaled back to focus on two more remunerative tasks: launching satellites for the Starlink comms network and $4 billion worth of contracts to land astronauts on the moon for NASA.

Unlike a multi-planetary civilization, there may be some logic in having SpaceX purchase a money-burning AI and social media to build data centers in Earth orbit, particularly if forecasts of rising demand and costs on the ground come true. Experts suggest that it might be possible in the 2030s.

Hypothetically, building satellites on the moon would require a lot more of Musk’s other dreams coming true first. Scientists and startups are experimenting with building chips and other precision components in space. But mass-producing many tons of advanced computers on the moon means we’re living in a universe where it is dramatically cheaper to get to space, which is the central requirement for those technologies, getting all the raw materials for such an effort to the moon, plus whatever is required for a “self-sustaining city.”

In a sense, that’s the point: This is the, uh, stretch goal. If meme-happy retail investors buy the argument, they could turn SpaceX shares into the next Tesla. The engineers, AI or aerospace, who Musk needs to achieve his goals may find the shift jarring. But the vision is one way to explain what xAI is about, other than an LLM perhaps best known as a pervert. As one of the company’s departing executives said on his way out the door, “all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring.”

Mass-producing a solar system-scale supercomputer on the moon is many things (I’m going to get emails for not using the word “insane”), but it is not the exact same thing, and it is not boring.

            <h2>Carrie Prejean Boller Is Not Going Quietly</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/carrie-prejean-boller-religious-liberty/685987/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“It is not a biblical mandate that I have to worship Israel,” Carrie Prejean Boller told me today. The former Miss California USA turned social-media influencer was dismissed from President Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission yesterday after drawing charges of anti-Semitism. But, she wanted to make clear, she regrets nothing—and has no intention of disappearing without a fight.

On Tuesday, the Religious Liberty Commission held its fifth hearing, in Washington, D.C., to discuss anti-Jewish prejudice. Meetings of blue-ribbon panels are typically sleepy, stage-managed affairs designed to serve the purposes of whatever administration put them together. But Boller had other ideas. She repeatedly interrogated the participants about their opinions on anti-Zionism, which she distinguished from anti-Semitism, and complained that other panelists had called Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, the wildly popular podcasters, anti-Semitic.

Video of Boller’s interjections went viral, sparking furious recriminations on the right. “I’m with her,” declared former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Boller took to social media in her own defense and began resharing others’ support for her conduct, including Owens’s claim that the two women were being assailed for refusing to “support the mass slaughter and rape of innocent children for occult Baal worshipers.” Boller’s performance raised her profile—her previously marginal X account increased its following 20-fold. “Be a good Goyim and give me a follow,” she posted Tuesday afternoon, inaccurately using the plural form of the colloquial Hebrew word for “non-Jew.” Yesterday, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the chair of the Religious Liberty Commission, announced that Boller had been removed, saying in a statement that “no member of the Commission has the right to hijack a hearing for their own personal and political agenda on any issue.”

Yair Rosenberg: The MAGA influencers rehabilitating Hitler

When I interviewed Boller by phone about her experience, she told me that the first attempt to oust her from the commission came back in August, when she received a phone call from a staffer at the Office of Presidential Personnel asking her to step down. Boller attributed this effort to her social-media posts about the devastation in Gaza. She alleged that Patrick and Paula White, a confidante of Trump’s whom Boller described as an “absolute evangelical demon,” had been “colluding with the White House.” (The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Boller cited her faith when explaining her position, as she had at the hearing. “It’s anti-Christian to accuse me of anti-Semitism by being a Christian,” she said. She reiterated that Zionism is not compatible with her Catholicism, the faith to which she converted in April. The Vatican has long recognized the state of Palestine and called for a two-state solution, positions at odds with those of the current Israeli government, but it has also backed Israel’s right to exist. Indeed, as long as the subject was Israel, Boller was eager to engage. But when the conversation turned to other things that she had said at the commission hearing that pertained to anti-Semitism, not merely anti-Zionism, she suddenly became much more evasive.

“I would really appreciate it if you would stop calling Candace Owens an anti-Semite,” she told one of the witnesses at the hearing, Seth Dillon, the CEO of the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee. “I don’t know why you keep bringing her up and Tucker,” she added. “Because they’re the two most famous anti-Semites,” retorted Dillon. “Everyone’s an anti-Semite!” Boller replied. “Do you think that anything Candace has said is anti-Semitic?” Dillon later asked. “No, I don’t,” Boller responded. “I listen to her daily, and I haven’t heard one thing out of her mouth that I would say is anti-Semitic.”

As it happens, Owens has said many deranged things about Jews, plenty of which have nothing to do with Israel. So I was surprised to hear her so vigorously defended at a hearing ostensibly devoted to combatting anti-Jewish bigotry. I raised the subject with Boller, who regularly reposts content from Owens on social media, and I quoted several recent claims that the podcaster had made.

On February 2, for instance, Owens praised the decision of General Ulysses S. Grant to expel all Jews from his military district in 1862, during the Civil War. The move was soon reversed by President Abraham Lincoln, and Grant later disavowed it—but Owens did not. “Jewish supremacists,” she said, “had everything to do with the Civil War in America. They excel at creating the false dialectic, the North versus the South, the left versus the right. Ulysses S. Grant notoriously expelled Jews from his military district: Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky. You think he just—he was just, like, what? Another white supremacist? Everyone’s just a white supremacist,” she said. “Well, they would have called him a white supremacist” or said that “he was anti-Semitic.”

I read this monologue to Boller and asked her if she thought it was anti-Semitic to defend expelling American Jews. “I’m not going to get involved in any of that,” she said. “I watched her show, and I have never heard anything out of her mouth that is anti-Semitic. So I’m not gonna make a statement on something that I haven’t heard the full context of.” I offered to play Boller the audio of this remark in its full context. She declined to listen. So I moved on to another of Owens’s greatest hits: blaming American Jews for the African slave trade. This canard has been repeatedly debunked by historians and repeatedly invoked by Owens. “Jewish people were the ones that were trading us,” she said in December. “Jewish people were in control of the slave trade. They’ve buried a lot of it, but it’s there and you can find it.”

Was this anti-Semitic? “From what I’ve heard from my ears, from her mouth, I have not heard anything that is anti-Semitic,” Boller repeated. Okay, but if someone such as Owens did say such things, it would be anti-Semitic, right? “I’m not playing the ‘What if?’ game,” she said, her previous moral clarity abruptly turning into cagey ambiguity.

I had hoped to ask Boller for her opinion about other claims made by Owens—that “Talmudic Jews” think “that we’re animals, that they have a right to own us, that they have a right to make us worship them,” and that Israel was complicit in the 9/11 attacks and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy—but she refused to engage and eventually ended the call. Rather than reckon with anti-Semitic statements from those she had defended at a hearing intended to confront anti-Semitism, she repeatedly attempted to reroute our conversation back to the safer ground of criticizing Israel. She either did not realize that she was using anti-Zionism as a pretext to launder vulgar anti-Semitism and its purveyors into the public square, or she did not care.

Although Boller may not be willing to answer such questions from a reporter, she is also not backing away from her views. Before our conversation concluded, she told me that she planned to show up at the Religious Liberty Commission’s next meeting because, she argued, only President Trump himself has the authority to fire her. “I remain on this commission until I hear from the president,” she said. “I want the president to admit: Is he ‘America First’ or ‘Israel First’?”</div>

            <h2>What Fabulous Timing for Gallup to Stop Tracking Presidential Approval!</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/gallup-poll-presidential-approval/685986/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two men from headquarters walked out to the corral to tell the pollster the news. They were a big man and a little man. They were identically attired, in a dark suit and dark glasses. Both carried a briefcase.

The pollster was leaning against the split-rail fence, looking at the horses. (The horses had started to appear 88 years ago due to a misspelling of Gallup. A new one arrived with each completed poll.)

“It’s not because the president’s approval rating has been so low,” the big man said.

“Oh?” the pollster said, looking at the men. He was old, somewhere from 55 to 80 (with a 99 percent confidence interval), and wore a wide-brimmed hat that looked his same age, or up to three years older than he was (with a 95 percent confidence interval). He looked cross, though not as cross as some cross-tabs that he had considered.

“It has nothing to do with that at all!” the little man said.

“Oh?” the pollster said. “Within what confidence interval?”

“It has nothing to do with the current presidency and how the president bullies people, especially the people responsible for numbers,” the big man said. “It’s not that he famously believes that his own net worth fluctuates depending on his mood, and that he seems to think other numbers should do the same thing—jobs numbers and poll numbers and vote totals and interest rates—and that if they don’t, it is because the numbers have ganged up on him maliciously.”

“Of course not!” the little man said. “Please don’t draw any imputations.”

“I wasn’t,” the pollster said, “but if anyone could do so accurately, I could.”

In the field, Harry Truman’s Approval Rating whinnied and tossed its head, and Richard Nixon’s Approval Rating flopped on one side and emitted a horrible gurgle.  “I wish we didn’t have horse personifications of all the approval ratings,” the little man said. “It gives me the creeps.”

“Horse-sonifications,” the pollster said.

“I’ll note it on the Likert scale.” The pollster fed Lyndon B. Johnson’s Second Term some oats. “But we’re Gallup polls, and this is what we do.”

“But we could stop at any time,” the big man said. “Like, February 2026. Definitely not a time when people want to know accurately how approved of the president is. Maybe they do! Maybe they don’t! We can’t know!”

“We can know,” the pollster said. “We are, in fact, experts. And have been for 88 years.”

“A good, long run,” the little man said. “A great run. Perfect time to stop.”

“Is it?” the pollster asked. “The perfect time?”

“I hear what you’re saying,” the big man replied, after a moment. “But do we need to have numbers about it? Maybe we can just do a drawing. That gets the same idea across. A sad face, and people can draw their own conclusions. Numbers are so—”

“Think about it another way,” the little man said. “When we go out for the numbers, don’t you worry about your crew? When the ratings plummet so steeply, do you ever worry they’ll take a pollster down with them?”

The pollster shrugged. “They train for it,” he said. “They believe in the value of a good number, even if that number is frightening to behold. They’ve seen things down in the cross-tabs that would turn your hair white.”

“I thought hair color was a discrete variable,” the little man said, “not a dependent variable.”

“You think they can’t handle this? This is exactly when we need good, accurate numbers most. You’re oversampling your fear. You should be independent, like one of the variables we measure, not dependent, like other, different, variables we measure.”

“It’s not because of fear,” the little man said. “It’s because of ‘an evolution in how Gallup focuses its public research and thought leadership.’”

In the field, Barack Obama’s First-Term Approval Rating whinnied.

“This change is part of a broader, ongoing effort to align all of Gallup’s public work with its mission.”

“We look forward to continuing to offer independent research that adheres to the highest standards of social science.”

Around them, night was starting to fall, covering the field in shadow.

“This is a strategic shift solely based on Gallup’s research goals and priorities,” the little man concluded.

“And what goals and priorities are those?” the pollster asked.

“Well,” the big man said. He looked uncomfortable. “Look, it’s a downer, having to bring these disapproval ratings over and over, month after month. Too many numbers make everyone sad! If you must know, we’re thinking of getting more into vibes.”

It was fully dark now. Across the field, something started to come toward them. Its horrible whinnying sounded like laughter. In the darkness, they couldn’t see what it was.

The pollster shrugged. “Next month’s,” he said. “Don’t you wish you had a little more data right about now?”</div>

After the administration announced the expansion of its law-enforcement surge in Minnesota early this year, calling it the “largest DHS operation ever,” Donald Trump laid out a series of stinging critiques of the state, which he said had an “incompetent governor,” a huge welfare-fraud problem, high crime, and a corrupt voting system. “What a beautiful place, but it’s being destroyed,” he said.

Today, the White House “border czar” Tom Homan announced the effective end to the mission, promising a “significant drawdown” over the coming week. “I have proposed, and President Trump has concurred, that this surge operation conclude,” Homan said. The announcement should be treated skeptically. When Trump ousted the Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino last month, the administration softened its tone but maintained a large and heavy-handed presence in Minneapolis. But Trump has good reasons to back down: The operation has been a political and moral disaster. Officers shot and killed two American citizens, and public opinion has turned against it.

The mission can hardly be said to have succeeded on Trump’s terms, either. Tim Walz remains governor, though he is not running for reelection. The state has refused to hand over voter rolls that the Justice Department tried to grab as a condition of a pullout. Minneapolis has seen a significant drop in crime in recent years, but the surge has arguably done more harm than good on that front: As Senator Amy Klobuchar noted last month, two of the city’s three January homicides were committed by federal agents. Meanwhile, the federal prosecutor who oversaw the welfare-fraud investigation resigned in protest of Trump-administration decisions (and is now representing a journalist whom the administration charged with dubious crimes).

Trump’s initial argument about the situation in Minnesota was that it was so dire, it required uniquely forceful action. Yet he’s now ready to pull back without achieving any of the goals he laid out. For another president, sending the agents home could be an acknowledgment of rethinking that calculus or reckoning with mistakes made. But that’s not how Trump has framed the decision. “We’re pulling out because we’ve done a great job there,” Trump told NBC News last week, going on to insult Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’s mayor. This fits into a pattern of his second term. The president announces a big push; it fails to achieve its goals and is roundly rejected by the people he claims it will benefit; he gives up in a huff. Trump’s mantra is You can’t fire me—I quit!

When Trump began deploying the National Guard to liberal cities such as Chicago and Portland in Democratic-led states around the country, he insisted that it was necessary to fight crime—even though crime was already dropping sharply, and National Guard troops aren’t trained in law enforcement and have limits on what they can do. (The president also said that he wanted to use cities as “training grounds for our military.”)

Because state leaders opposed the deployments, Trump had to federalize the National Guard, but the states challenged that in court. In December, the Supreme Court issued a ruling limiting the president’s ability to nationalize the National Guard in Illinois, which used the same rationale he’d employed elsewhere. A spokesperson promised that the administration would “continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public,” but apparently Trump decided that didn’t require the National Guard after all. Rather than pursue other possible legal avenues, the White House quietly dropped the matter, pulling all federalized troops from cities.

This isn’t just about armed federal agents in the streets, though. As I wrote earlier this month, Trump insisted that he had big plans for the Kennedy Center, the capital’s premier performing-arts hall, when he embarked on an unprecedented takeover, removing much of the center’s board, pushing out its leaders, and slapping his own name on it. But now, with those efforts producing a barren schedule and empty chairs, Trump appears to just be giving up. He has announced that the Kennedy Center will close for two years starting in July, and he’s been vague about what will happen during the closure.

These examples capture the haphazard and capricious nature of Trump’s presidency. On the one hand, he has insisted in each case that the circumstances are so urgent or dangerous that they require unprecedented action and assertions of federal power. Yet once he encounters pushback, he decides that the problems are not so serious that they require sustained commitment or a real attempt to defend them. Instead, he just walks away.

Trump is no more steadfast in foreign affairs. During the run-up to the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize announcement, Trump portrayed himself as a diplomat par excellence, the man who had ended six—no, seven—no, eight wars. But his frustrations with the difficulty of actually doing diplomacy kept showing through. In spring of last year and then again in the summer, Trump engaged in perfunctory work to broker negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, but as soon as they foundered on Russian intractability, he threw up his hands and said he wouldn’t bother.

Now he seems to have abandoned his quest to be seen as a peacemaker altogether. After kidnapping Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro last month, he began demanding control of Greenland. “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump ranted to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

For understandable reasons, that approach was not popular with anyone: not with Denmark, of which Greenland is a part; not with Greenlanders; not with European allies; and not with the American people, who remain unconvinced of the need for annexation. So Trump did what came naturally—he gave up, accepted what was effectively already the status quo, and said that it was what he’d wanted all along.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Tide Goes Out on Youth Gender Medicine

As the shaky evidence base for youth gender medicine has become better known, activists have retreated to an argument from authority. Never mind the Cass Report, whose findings resulted in the closure of Britain’s leading youth gender clinic. Never mind the study by a leading American practitioner showing that the treatments she championed did not improve minors’ mental health. Never mind reports that some adolescents were being put on a medical pathway after only a single clinic visit. For advocates, the important thing to remember was that “gender-affirming care” for minors—puberty blockers and hormones, plus surgery in rare cases—was endorsed by all of the major American medical associations.

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that Britain used to pay its poets laureate mostly in wine? Beginning in 1630, the perk for taking on the job of voice of a nation was a small stipend and a “butt of sherry” from the monarch. In case you are not familiar with butts, they hold around 500 liters of wine, which I imagine really got the poetry flowing.

The 1790 laureate gave up his sherry—boo!—for a higher salary, ending the practice. But in 1984, the laureate Ted Hughes rekindled the tradition, and sherry has been delivered to every officeholder since. Alas, it’s now typically spread out over the laureate’s 10-year term; 72 bottles a year is nothing to sneeze at, but there’s nothing like a butt.

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the Andersonville prison popularized the word deadline? Before it came to mean “due date,” the word had a gory, literal meaning: Prisoners at Andersonville and camps like it who crossed a certain boundary marked on the ground—the deadline—would be shot without warning. As dispatches emerged from Andersonville toward the end of the Civil War, understanding of (and horror at) the term quickly spread.

By the 1920s, newspapers had taken up the “do not cross” meaning to describe the time by which they had to finalize their next edition, and the rest of the world took the papers’ lead.

And by the way, did you know that—well, where to begin with Ashgabat? The massive statue of Niyazov is, like, the ninth thing you notice about the city.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

Hoping to get around the ghostly city? Enjoy your ride in a white car; darkly colored cars are outlawed. You can head to the airport modeled on a flying white falcon, or to the world’s largest enclosed Ferris wheel, made of white steel. There is also the massive (white) Palace of Happiness, which can accommodate seven weddings at once. And in case you were wondering, brides in the country typically wear—got you here!—red.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.</div>

            <h2>A 168-Year-Old Question Still Worth Asking</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/slave-power-conspiracy-rise-edmund-quincy/685976/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic’s archives to contextualize the present. Sign up here.

A vivid rumor began circulating in the United States in the middle of the 1850s. It was said that Robert Toombs, the ardently pro-slavery Georgia senator, was going to come to Boston and “call the roll of his slaves at the foot of Bunker Hill.” It’s not clear where the notion of a southern politician taking enslaved people to a sacred Revolutionary battlefield came from—whether Toombs spread it to troll the high-minded, antislavery Bostonians, or whether the Bostonians themselves conjured it from their own fever dreams. The nightmare never came to pass, but it was the kind of idea—conspiratorial, frightening, plausible—that flourishes in a highly charged political environment.

These were the conditions in which The Atlantic was established: information overload and profound uncertainty. By the end of 1857, no one knew the crack-up of the Union was coming in three years, or that the nation would be in a civil war in four, but the portents were bleak. What did this mean for the new monthly magazine “devoted to literature, art, and politics”? With respect to politics, the mission pledged fealty to “no party or clique,” alignment with no “sect of anties”—that is, single-minded reformers. But the crisis over slavery and its encroachments shaped what the magazine’s values looked like in practice.

The Atlantic’s second issue included a thunderous philippic of some 7,600 words on the relentless encroachments of slavery and the fate of the Republic. Written by Edmund Quincy, “Where Will It End?” voiced the urgency of what was called the “Slave Power conspiracy”—the idea, borne out by national politics in the 1850s, that southern oligarchs and their groveling northern enablers (“doughfaces,” in the lingo of the day) had seized control of every level of government to spread slavery to every corner of the country and beyond. Quincy’s essay shows a person reckoning with a moment like our own, when our institutions feel like they’re on the verge of collapse and a shared understanding of what holds the country together is fraying.

Where will it end? was a sensible question. The U.S.-Mexican War in the 1840s threatened to bring slavery to large new swaths of western territories. High-profile cases in which fugitive slaves were recaptured in the North left Bostonians on alert for “slave hunters” in their midst. Violence erupted in Kansas in 1854, not over fugitive slaves but over the prospect of slavery taking hold there. In 1856, violence came to Washington, too, when a South Carolina congressman brutally caned the Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate, two days after Sumner delivered a withering antislavery speech. The Supreme Court issued the Dred Scott decision in March 1857, both negating the citizenship of Black Americans and Congress’s power to limit the expansion of slavery.

The force of Quincy’s essay resided not in rehearsing this full litany of offenses for The Atlantic’s readers but in delineating its implications. Slavery had become ever more entrenched in America; this transformation had brought the fringe to the mainstream, made the unthinkable thinkable, the impermissible permissible. “What was once whispered in the secret chamber of council,” Quincy wrote, “is now proclaimed on the housetops.”

What was once done by indirection and guile is now carried with the high hand, in the face of day, at the mouth of the cannon and by the edge of the sabre of the nation. Doctrines and designs which a few years since could find no mouthpiece out of a bar-room, or the piratical den of a filibuster, are now clothed with power by the authentic response of the bench of our highest judicatory, and obsequiously iterated from the oracular recesses of the National Palace.

As the “Slave Power” was ascending, the Republic was declining. Sycophants had replaced statesmen to do the bidding of a “coarse and sordid oligarchy.” Violence and intimidation had overtaken discussion and persuasion. In addition to Brooks’s attack on Sumner, Quincy noted that a Tennessee minister had been forced to leave his church after denouncing the beating of an enslaved person, and a Virginia politician had been barred from returning home after attending a northern political convention. The corrosive effects extended well beyond politics. Northern publishers expurgated literary texts for fear of offending slaveholders; antislavery publications were barred from being mailed in the South. “In the blighting shadow of Slavery,” Quincy wrote, “letters die and art cannot live.”

His essay did not dwell in despair, however. Quincy closed by arguing that the “success of the conspiracy” was not “final and eternal,” but instead that its stridency was a response to the strength of a growing opposition. “We discern the confession” of the opposition’s might “in the very extravagancies and violences of the Slave Power,” Quincy wrote. “It rages, for its time is short.”

Quincy’s confidence was rooted not in a clique but in a party he didn’t name. The Republicans had formed a broad antislavery coalition that mounted a strong showing in the 1856 presidential election, despite suffering a defeat. “The thunder of its protest,” Quincy believed, “struck terror into the heart of tyrants.” He predicted that the “Slave Power” would end with the Republicans’ triumph, and the “ideal of a true republic” would be realized, thus cementing “the great experiment of this Western World” as “a Model, instead of a Warning.” Quincy scarcely could have imagined that its triumph would come through a destructive war, or that his question—Where will it end?—would remain open long after that.</div>

You took something simple like Notepad, added features we didn&#39;t want, and not only made it worse but actually made it insecure and fundamentally broken.

This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad.

The goal of Microsoft is to keep turning record profits after they saturated the market 30 years ago. Want to make sure your endpoints are up to date on patches? They now have a subscription for that. Want to avoid installing crap like this in the first place? They have a subscription for that too.

What Microsoft overlooks is that there is a red line where they will just die if they cross it. They are dangerously close to that line and may be over it. I mean, how utterly incompetent can you get? A mistake like the one here can only happen if security aspects were completely ignored during development.

Any good monopolist knows that they have to deliver at least somewhat reasonable quality to retain the monopoly. MS does not understand that. Hence their products are now incompetently made toys.

This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad.Yes. But that would require somebody sane with some actual insight and understanding of IT security at Microsoft making decisions. They do not have such people.

Yes. But that would require somebody sane with some actual insight and understanding of IT security at Microsoft making decisions. They do not have such people.

Microsoft has no security mind-set, while having a lot of security-critical products. Obviously, they mess it up time and again. Although the level of sheer incompetence on display here is astonishing even for them. Also remember &quot;Security is our highest priority&quot; (stated last probably in 2024 by MS CEO). If they make mistakes this grossly clueless and dangerous now, it just means they cannot do it right. No other interpretation is possible.

I just think the cause is a bit different.

They have this habit of making everything as general as possible without thinking through the implications, while trying to &quot;extend&quot; anything they didn&#39;t make. So you end up with a generic URL parsing library that will happily launch installers from a text file in Notepad and similar nonsensical capabilities nobody in their right mind would intentionally use.

Youtuber Low Level did a pretty good video on this vulnerability. Yes it is a bad vulnerability and yes it is serious, but it&#39;s not like a user isn&#39;t warned several times when clicking on such a link.

He also pointed out that the drive to put AI into everything now makes restricting process permissions a lot harder. For example in the past there was no reason to ever let notepad.exe access the internet.  Now with copilot integrated, it&#39;s regularly accessing the internet.

This sort of thing used to be done very subtly...it&#39;s generally not good practice to let your adversaries know you&#39;re actively recruiting fired subordinates, lest those subordinates &quot;commit suicide.&quot;

Demoralizing your enemy by making him more concerned about looking over his shoulder than paying attention to you is not a bad strategy.

Anyone remember that time that Hillary Clinton leaked the IDs of CIA spies in China to China and the CPC executed them all?

But I watched an interesting interview with John Le Carre (the spy writer) a while ago and he was talking about how the informants he recruited mostly just loved the idea of betraying people and did it for kicks. They probably don&#39;t think far enough ahead to imagine being betrayed themselves.

Anyone remember that time that Hillary Clinton leaked the IDs of CIA spies in China to China and the CPC executed them all?No, because it didn&#39;t happen. There is no public record, evidence, or official accusation from the FBI, CIA, or Department of Justice linking her to that specific intelligence failure. Also, I think you meant the CCP instead of the CPC, but hey, gaslight on!

Anyone would be a fool to think that their identity as an informant would be safe with the US government.

And just a few years ago, Chinese agencies compromised a CIA communication systems and obtained a list of spies working for the US.  They were all arrested and imprisoned and executed.  I don&#39;t know if you can call it &quot;murder&quot; when high treason is the one crime that still carries a death penalty even in countries like Australia that are mostly opposed to capital punishment.

This is the definition of a reverse centaur.

It does. But that is not a job any junior person can handle competently.

So, basically, it is a push to hire more salespeople in the hope to sell the slop the &quot;AI&quot; is producing?

Since H-1B&#39;s are harder to get nowadays, and opening offices in a bunch of countries isn&#39;t cheap (along with the employee-friendly/business-hostile employment laws outside of the USA) Hiring people just out of school might make some sense.

Now, in a few years&#39; time after the junior employees have groked all the tribal knowledge from the seasoned veterans, the seasoned veterans will be introduced to the IBM job cut guillotine just like they were during the great recession.

The lesson I learned when I was employed is that I should have changed employers more often. Staying put means seasoned veterans get screwed in their 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s.

They are hiring three interns instead of the previous one? Bravo!

IBM has been offshoring the fuck out of the company for the last decade or more. Domestic hiring is virtually non-existent.

IBM plans to reduce salaries 3x because people can just type stuff into Claude.

IBM needs to reload it&#39;s stock pile of people for their annual layoffs. That way their headcount remains the same at the end of the year and they can still grind up their quota of souls like usual.

It was not precision engineering, but it worked, even if it wasn&#39;t finely tuned. Even though he wasn&#39;t a mechanic, his hobbyist knowledge allowed hi

Ah, so they are setting themselves up for failure. No surprise. Because monitoring LLMs is a job that requires a lot of experience and insight.

While it was always clear to smart people, what this shows is that the core promises of the LLM-peddlers are simply one thing: Lies.

WordPress is more of an ecosystem than a product. A new WordPress can never reasonably compete with WordPress because of the giant market of service providers and plugin developers that has spring up around it.

Most WP plugins are garbage, adding functionality that should have been core functionality.

People forget that wordpress offers no core functionality at all other than writing text blogs, and commenting on the text blogs. Everything else, is a plugin.

We&#39;re now in the race to IPO phase of this shitty dotcom era remake, which means we&#39;re also in the &quot;but they didn&#39;t make it to IPO&quot; phase of that. It&#39;s going to be a wild ride.

I have to ask something, because it&#39;s relevant.

When you say it&#39;s a &quot;shitty dotcom era remake&quot;, what level of informed statement is that? How recently have you used the frontier models from OpenAI or Anthropic?  Are you genuinely informed here, or making an assessment off using Cursor for a couple hours 4 months ago? Because that&#39;s not even close to representative of where things are today.

Just this week and last, I&#39;ve used the frontier models to fully audit an existing code base and make both architectural

There&#39;s a billion different ways to do it and I don&#39;t  think there&#39;s a right way exactly, but defining scope for the models helps a lot.

A lot of planning before any implementation, with precise criteria for how and where things get implemented, and each plan gets further broken down in that regard. Have a good architectural picture of how things are supposed to look. MVC isolation helps a lot. Know the data model and how your controller does its thing.

I can&#39;t emphasize enough how much planning seems to impa

>> a good primary prompt, and CLAUDE.md files with well defined project definitions, structure, and so on.

It sure does help to have a good idea as to what it is that you want to do and be able to articulate it. The LLM&#39;s will give a lot of suggestions if you ask, and many times they are things you haven&#39;t thought about. Best to spend the time to get a good implementation plan together with it before you let it do any work.

Anyone who thinks AI is a bubble is vastly underestimating how far reaching this is.  ChatGPT is a just toy compared to what is coming from AI.

&quot;A personal note for non-tech friends and family on what AI is starting to change.&quot;

https://shumer.dev/something-b... [shumer.dev]

A &quot;personal&quot; note from &quot;I&#39;m Matt Shumer — founder & CEO at OthersideAI (HyperWrite). I build and invest in AI products, ship fast, and share what I learn with a large audience.&quot;

No conflict of interest, none whatsoever. No reason to skew the truth.

The author is a CEO of an AI company and an investor in others. I don&#39;t mean to poo-poo the actual legitimate advances being made in AI, but this isn&#39;t an unbiased piece. He&#39;s overstating the capabilities of LLMs in my opinion, but someone who has vested financial interests in the industry is of course going to say those things. The current AI industry is based primarily on the commercialization of LLMs.

I use the latest coding models in my own work and while they do some really awesome things, they are far

I keep hearing this, and my experience (from within the last month) is like talking to a dude who&#39;s been at the company for decades and knows a lot about everything, but also has a drug problem and doesn&#39;t confirm what he is saying before he blurts it out. I think a lot of people are using robust frameworks but when you are working with brittle languages and specifications things don&#39;t go so well. For example in C, integer overflow is undefined. You might say, so what, Intel and ARM chips have had sane beha

Are you serious? There&#39;ve been all kinds of discoveries directly attributed to the use of AI:

New mathematical conjectures [wikipedia.org]  Protein folding [wired.com]  New math theorems [sky.com]  Cracked Erds theory [ft.com]  New discoveries in fluid dynamics [businessinsider.com]

This is just scratching the surface. Researchers have been using similar more primitive models for years already, and things are starting to get spicy.

Programmer friends at Google, Meta and Amazon have certainly convinced me that code is being assisted successfully by AI.  However, the author&#39;s level of extrapolation to other fields and situations destroys any credibility he had.

For example, the author - Matt Shumer, who is an AI company founder, booster and frequent submitter to other AI-hype websites, but apparently is not legally trained - spends many paragraphs and anecdotes tal

I&#39;ve read it and he&#39;s at least over the target, if not on the mark.

If it dropped your cloud spend by 90% you were doing something dumb in the first place, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a credible expert in whatever it is you claim to be doing.

You&#39;re not wrong: prototyping using prior LLMs that did things poorly with regards to database schema optimization and calls, primarily. Three months of work that&#39;d have taken years of solo development, before AI. Implement then optimize.

But I could&#39;ve done it the old school way and toiled over it by hand. I&#39;d still be back in December, thinking about how to implement the abstraction layers...

IPO already? Sounds like they&#39;re running out of smart money and moving onto the dumb.

Unless they&#39;ve managed to improve things internally much faster than it&#39;s perceived. They&#39;re moving extremely fast.

There&#39;s a lot of talk that the Opus 4.6 is really just Sonnet 5 (and behavioral characteristics lend no small amount of credibility to this claim) with much higher margins + intentional token slowdown, which could in theory mean they&#39;re now making money per token instead of losing it.

No, they&#39;re expecting the free money to dry up, and the company&#39;s value to plummet. If they cash out just before that happens, they maximize their own bank accounts.

This is basically an admission that the bubble is about to burst.

Last week I praised Claude code, especially the cli here on slashdot. I still think it&#39;s currently the best but it&#39;s also the most expensive.  But the competition is getting a lot better (and cheaper).  I&#39;ve been using the opencode cli lately with several models:  Kimi K2.5, Kimi K2.5 Thinking, OpenCode&#39;s Big Pickle, and Qwen3 Coder Next.  Using them through OpenCode&#39;s Zen service and also OpenRouter (for Qwen3 Coder Next), they are all about 1/2 the cost of Claude&#39;s models, maybe less.

Of those I feel that Kimi K2.5 Thinking is probably the closest to Claude Opus 4.6.  The rest are quite good at most things, and Qwen3 Coder Next is very fast.  Qwen3 Coder Next also has the potential to run on &quot;reasonable&quot; local hardware.

I think in the next year we&#39;ll see some of the open source models catch up with and surpass the closed models in a real way. Even if they get to Opus 4.5/4.6 parity (I personally think 4.5 is markedly more predictable in its behavior and makes a better &quot;daily driver&quot; than 4.6), that&#39;s still more than good enough to daily drive for almost all tasks. Tools like opencode make agent-specific models not only tenable but practical, to boot.

This is still fairly early stage. You&#39;ve got to run things at scale and se

Usually an IPO gives a cash burning startup enough money to stay afloat for at least a year. Although, with the way Open AI is burning through cash building ALL the data centers, they might go through it quicker than that.

So, that said... we should expecting the next great tech stock implosion to happen around mid 2027?

If they want to it really mean something, then a company should be taxed on their valuation.

That&#39;s probably the most terrifying thing any of these companies would ever want to hear. Looking at you Tesla.

Tax them on their valuations, and we&#39;ll see those numbers drop down to something much more reasonable.

And the biggest companies will be the ones who are actually doing shit.

This fiction only serves to enrich a very few people.

Pedo protecting Trump officials laugh at you pitiful example of reach.

The fact Trump hasn&#39;t fired Pam Bondi after her disastrous display. Shows she was doing exactly what he wanted.
pedo protecting goes right to the top.

Did you read the same post I did? It clearly indicates that they actually didn&#39;t know the identity of the hackers, and with the skills of the CIA wrt making hacks looks like they come from elsewhere, I&#39;m not surprised. It&#39;s rather refreshing to see some not falling for the CIA&#39;s tricks, for a change.

Yes, nice. But then you read &quot;Attributing sophisticated hacks is notoriously difficult and debates over how best to assign blame for digital intrusions are common among cybersecurity researchers.&quot; and with a grain of salt in your head you should be able to question &quot;how, then, did you figure out it was the chinese?&quot;.

Yes, it means the CIA, who have documented skills at making hacking look like it comes from...anywhere.

If PA is willing to engage in deception and coverups in order to simp and cover for authoritarians... and obviously they are, because they did... then they can simply never be trusted in a security context again.  And since security is basically their entire thing; anyone who uses them or continues to use them, moving forward, is a catastrophic fool.

And all the unconstitutional surveillance of own citizens that goes on is ok? Heh ok ok

Exactly. Palo Alto&#39;s 15 minutes of fame, but not quite the way they wanted it.

Expect this to be referenced for a long time like Sony&#39;s root-kit [grokipedia.com].

Easy, he&#39;s shifted the focus of America&#39;s hegemonic power away from Asia and to South America which is extremely stupid.

Basically Trump is a coward and not willing to put his rep on the line unless it&#39;s a sure thing, like the US military beating up on smaller countries rather than risk something even if just and in Americas interest like standing up for Taiwan or supplying aid to Ukraine.   Big part of the reason he loves Israel and Netenyahu, they&#39;re dominant in the region, easy &quot;wins&quot; for him and that&#39;s what matters most, how he feels, not Americas reputation or interests.

The idea of exporting Western European democracy to culturesit does not fit was bipartisan, but reducing the odds of nuclear war by giving the CCP economic skin in the game was an improvement over decades of nuclear standoff.

Nixons and millions of other Americans key error was imagining US businesses were capable of patriotism.

Democracy ensured idiocracy so here we are. I can&#39;t blame the rich for taking advantage of thoroughly unappealing bipedal bovines.

Wouldn&#39;t a democracy make China even stronger????

Yes. The book &quot;The Devil&#39;s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America&#39;s Secret Government&quot; has a section discussing the rise of Nixon&#39;s corruption. His abuse of power started at least as early as an officer in the Navy overseeing spending contracts. He was then tapped as a useful asset to spoil a California election. His handlers were as anti-democratic as people get.

Who let China into WTO with &quot;Most Preferred Status?&quot;

Nixon opened the door, but Billy Bob Clinton took the door off the hinges.

Wherever you&#39;re getting your talking points from is failing you miserably.. you should really return all the yuan they&#39;re paying you to shit all over this site.

Manufacturing in the US didn&#39;t crater &#39;til after China was let into WTO.  Fact.

Don&#39;t blame China for your own political problems...you only have yourselves to blame. China is not the USA and does not force it&#39;s politics on others.

Not only that, but they can make their hacks on non-Chinese system look like they come from China! You really cannot tell...

But, yeah, everyone does it to everyone else, so you&#39;ll be correct at some point. It all boils down to &quot;it&#39;s OK when we do it, but not when they do it&quot;.

It&#39;s a fight against the sponsorship provided by the US government for anything that vilified China...there is money up for grabs for anything &quot;China bad&quot;.Anything China does to counter it is peanuts in comparison.

I was thinking of (eastern) Egypt. Americans don&#39;t seem to understand what &quot;Asia&quot; is, and how big and heterogeneous it is. Calling someone &quot;Asian&quot; is almost meaningless.

The release of the Epstein files—the slow-drip revelations of a web of privileged (mostly) men trading gifts, access, favors, and sickening child predation as casually as Pokémon cards—has been deliberately parsed out through 2026 as to both be buried itself and bury other horrific news coming out of the Trump administration. But this misses a critical point: The Epstein file dump is not simply playing out as a backdrop against which other acts of American lawlessness are occurring. The Epstein story is also the template and the proof text for all that is happening in Minnesota; at dangerous detention centers; in efforts to punish members of Congress for lawful speech; for crypto scams; and for measles outbreaks. It is an ongoing road map for an administration that lives out the reality that they are rich and powerful and famous enough to be above the law each day, and wishes for the rest of us to ultimately learn and accept that fact.

So it follows that Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying blithely before a congressional hearing on Wednesday, as Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors sat behind her, unacknowledged and irrelevant to her purposes, is the template for that messaging: Blond woman who knows she must seek and maintain protection from this administration’s simulacrum of justice crows about the Dow Jones for the cameras, because she understands that if she doesn’t, she will be left behind, asking to be respected, like the masses of women behind her.

And it is equally true that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick could bring his children and their nannies to a bespoke lunch on Epstein’s island in 2012, long after he allegedly broke off contact with the sex predator, precisely because Lutnick’s children and their nannies were not the types of children or women who would be abandoned there to be raped and threatened. He is also a walking infomercial about whom the law protects and whom it leaves broken and invisible, behind. Lutnick’s testimony this past week, like Bondi’s, is thus operating as a still life in what happens when the law becomes inert. On the one hand, it is not relevant as a restraint to those who need not rely on it; on the other, it is not protective for those who do.

Liz Plank, on her Substack, describes the nausea and disorientation felt by women realizing this past week that we had all been gaslit yet again. Those of us who cannot even begin to imagine a permission structure that allowed and encouraged passing young girls around, trading insults and articles about them (“your littlest girl was a little naughty”), and bonding over the hysteria of #MeToo can barely comprehend why it was that this class of men always took the gift and the freebie and the shitty watch and the plane trip, because access to yet more of the same somehow became the coin of the realm. What Plank describes as “trust bias”—the psychological tendency to assume that others are operating within the same moral and ethical universe as yourself—means that we are all, once again, annihilated by the fact that America’s shared moral universe is a collective fiction, one that constrains one class of people and merely titillates another.

We err when we call what is being done by ICE officials to citizens and noncitizens on the streets of American cities “law,” just as we err when we call what has thus far been afforded the Epstein survivors “justice.” Indeed, the word law is too generous to contain the plea deals and the willing ignorance and the prison transfers that were granted to Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators at every turn. And the word injustice is far too small to describe the spectacle of hundreds of survivors who have still not been given a reckoning or a measure of genuine accountability, whose unredacted names appeared in public documents and who had never been contacted by the Department of Justice.

Pam Bondi may be in charge of many officials and many investigations and many legal things at the DOJ, but what she is protecting is neither justice nor law. And that means that what Plank describes as a trust bias is also an exquisitely American “law bias,” and we should dispense with the notion that we are all in some group compact to protect and preserve the same things. The law is neither protecting the vulnerable nor constraining the Epstein class. And perhaps we should stop referencing that word to mean either project, much less deploying it to describe both.

What Bondi, and Donald Trump, and Lutnick, and Todd Blanche are doing under the banner of law and law enforcement and pardons and immunity and impunity is an operatic performance of a single truth: The “law” will now protect those who are within the network of favors and privilege and secrets and side-eyes and snickers and abuse of young girls, and the “law” will also abandon those who are not. What Bondi did this week under the bright lights of the U.S. Congress was to personify that the law is a word for the thing that is “weaponized” when it’s used against the president, and is the thing that is bestowed benignly on those who seek his grace. This is a protection racket, and we are being conditioned in plain sight to recognize that it protects itself and it preys on everyone who refuses to buckle.

This isn’t to say that the law is meaningless. Judges across the country prove every day that the law is still the last, best guardrail against that sort of nihilist thinking. But the attorney general’s performance was an hourslong spectacle enacted solely to highlight who lives above the law and who must beg it for scraps. We should probably stop calling this law and call it simply “power.” Just as we could stop calling Bondi the AG and call her Trump’s constitutional Roomba. We should almost certainly stop calling the Epstein survivors anything other than the legal heroes and dreamers they are.

On Wednesday, I went for a walk outside around a lake near my home. I didn’t wear a mask. I could see, clearly, the buildings on the other side. I came home feeling happy and invigorated.

This doesn’t sound like much, but I live in Hanoi, Vietnam, a city that frequently ranks as one of the world’s most polluted. It is an incredible place to live: culturally vibrant, wonderfully optimistic, with notoriously excellent food. But when it’s “pollution season”—roughly October to March—too much time outdoors and without a mask means headaches, an itchy throat, and sore lungs, not to mention an elevated risk of everything from asthma to dementia to various cancers. On Wednesday, we had a rare afternoon where the Air Quality Index was below 100. The air quality on my app was yellow, or moderate—not even the elusive green, which signals good air—but in a Hanoi winter, yellow is a gift.

By the time I went on my only-moderately-polluted walk, I had already been assigned to write a column about the Trump administration’s obliteration of efforts to fight climate change. I was mulling how incredible it is that Americans live in a wealthy, developed, incredibly prosperous nation; that we generally enjoy clean water, clean land, and clean air, and even clean air in our largest cities; that we enjoy that level of cleanliness in large part thanks to the environmental movement and the many rules and regulations environmentally conscious politicians have put into place; and that there are right-wing American activists who have dedicated their careers to undoing all of it—and there’s a large contingent of American voters who support them.

Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, run by climate change denialists and people who seem oddly hostile to the environment they are in charge of protecting, is revoking the “endangerment finding,” a ruling that underpins much of the government’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The endangerment finding operates under the Clean Air Act, and to be clear, that law has not yet been revoked (although they would if they could). But overturning the endangerment finding undermines the law’s ability to do anything about climate change—and it’s hard to overstate just how devastating this deregulation will be for the planet. Scientists are unified in the understanding that pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the earth, which in turn drives natural disasters, drought, disease, flooding, and even war.

The fight isn’t over. Environmental and public health groups will immediately sue to protect the (glaringly obvious) finding that the propellants of catastrophic climate change do indeed present a risk to public health. But the administration is ready to take their case to a very deregulation-friendly and Trump-favoring Supreme Court. They’re seeking a quick result so that they can take a sledgehammer not just to environmental regulations, but to the federal government’s very ability to impose environmental regulations—making it harder, if not impossible, for future Democratic presidents to take decisive action on the environment. “They want to not just do what other Republican administrations have done, which is weaken regulations,” Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program head Jody Freeman told the New York Times. “They want to take the federal government out of the business of regulation, period.”

This is par for the course from an administration that is hostile not just to efforts to fight climate change, but to the kind of green energy that will power the future—and that is already powering the present in much of the world. Renewables are overtaking coal and gas, and the market for green energy is exploding. There are enormous economic opportunities here, ones that President Joe Biden put America on the path to enjoying; before Trump took office, many people, especially in red states, were already cashing in. Trump has walked back many of these gains, squandering billions of dollars.

You might have read about the dystopia of super-polluted cities like Delhi, where the city always seems to be shrouded in dust, and you don’t see the sun for days. But here, I think the evenings are the strangest. The streetlights illuminate what looks like fog, and you can see little particles of dust and debris swirling around. I always think: Oh, that’s going directly into my lungs.

My days are set by my AQI app. I prefer to work in my favorite café down the street—Hanoi has famously exceptional coffee culture—but it doesn’t run air purifiers, and so if the AQI is dangerously high, I stay home. On the few times I have risked it, I’ve come home nauseous, and with a pounding headache, itchy red eyes, and lungs that feel inflamed and like they won’t quite fill up all the way. The app I use has a little cartoon person to illustrate each level of danger. On green days, he smiles. On yellow (moderate) days, he’s neutral; orange (unhealthy for sensitive groups) days, he frowns; red (unhealthy) he wears a mask; purple (very unhealthy) he dons a respirator; and when it’s maroon (hazardous), he has on an even more serious respirator and looks extremely alarmed—this means the AQI is over 300, “a health warning of emergency conditions,” which means that “the entire population is likely to be severely affected,” according to the IQAir app. (I keep New York on my AQI app too: It’s almost always green.)

People in Hanoi aren’t living like this for fun. Vietnam is something of an economic miracle, with a stunning rate of economic growth. It has rapidly industrialized, which has lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty. Those people then buy motorbikes, build houses, and work in newly constructed factories (go ahead and check how many of your most recent Amazon orders, whatever they were, were made in Vietnam). Pollution from the traffic, factories, and construction is all severe; the benefits of all of these things are also extraordinary in a country that was ravaged by war just a few decades ago. There are certainly ways for countries to develop sustainably; it seems questionable whether there are ways for countries to rapidly industrialize and develop at a cheetah’s pace and not seriously degrade the environment in the process. Here, though, the calculus is complex. Yes, the air pollution is horrible, and kills some 60,000 people every year. But in the early 1990s, close to four in five Vietnamese households were living in extreme poverty. Now, extreme poverty is inching toward zero. That is even more life-saving.

And while it’s far from perfect, the government here is in fact trying to implement environmental regulations to protect the country’s diverse ecology, clean up the air, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Americans are not living under a similar calculus. We don’t have to choose between economic prosperity and a livable country (not to mention a livable planet). We can move toward even greater prosperity by investing in future-forward clean energy sources. We can be good stewards of a spectacular country, with its plains and canyons and mountains and deserts, as well as its vibrant cities.

At this moment, however, we’re simply choosing not to. Trump has said he supports clean air but not efforts to address climate change, but the two are inextricable. The move from fossil fuels to green energy is not only a must for greenhouse gas reduction, it’s a huge part of reducing the kind of conventional pollutants that continue to degrade our air quality—and our lungs.

A small handful of people are making a whole lot of money in sticking with the old dirty energy sources. This administration has intentionally set back progress on wind and solar projects, as well as on the electric vehicles that much of the world is transitioning over to, in order to prop up a few wealthy tycoons at the expense of the rest of us. And of course the burdens are not felt equally. This is certainly true where I live: I have the resources to buy good air purifiers, a job that lets me work from home, the money to take a taxi rather than a motorbike if I want to get somewhere, and the knowledge of the dangers and how to mitigate them (for example: burning through half a dozen rolls of winterizing tape to seal every door and window so less of the bad air can get in). That’s not the case for huge swaths of the population here, and certainly not for the people whose entire livelihoods revolve around dealing with the trash and pollutants that are the cost of development. In the U.S., low-income residents, as well as Black, Latino, and Asian Americans, are disproportionately exposed to much higher levels of air pollution than white and wealthier Americans, which contributes to illness and premature death. Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” is notorious for industrial pollution that lays waste to the human population—and the people who live closest to the industrial plants tend to be Black and poor.

Even with this decimation of environmental regulations, America’s largest cities are unlikely to regularly find themselves on the most-polluted lists. But the air pollution you can see is far from the only risk to your health, your community, other human beings, and the future of life on our planet. As someone who checks the AQI like it’s the weather, I am genuinely, profoundly flummoxed by those who invite in environmental degradation and the destruction of what makes so much of this world so beautiful—and who, in the name of politics or profit, are so willing to burn the future.

With great fanfare last summer, House and Senate Republicans approved $45 billion to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention capacity as part of their signature catchall bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This exorbitant amount—one of many line items in the bill’s historic ramp-up of immigration enforcement funding—was considered an easy part of the bill to pass. Republicans didn’t fight over it. Democrats, still angsty after the 2024 election about looking soft on immigration, didn’t call much attention to it.

But now that this network of massive detention centers—large-scale holding centers for people awaiting deportation—is being constructed, the reaction from Republicans is: Not in my backyard.

From Maryland and Virginia to Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Arizona, and everywhere in between, massive warehouses that the Department of Homeland Security is purchasing to convert into detention centers are being met with fierce resistance. It should go without saying that Democratic officials, who’ve recently rediscovered their courage in opposing Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement plans, don’t want 1,500-to-10,000-bed cogs in Trump’s deportation machine within their jurisdictions—or anyone else’s. But it’s the pushback from national Republican electeds, who voted enthusiastically to construct this apparatus just last summer, that’s especially notable. They’re not protesting on behalf of the detainees, or rejecting the administration’s vision. All are quick to point out that they adore the goals of this project. But if you try to place a piece of this infrastructure in their communities, well, someone in the administration is going to get an earful.

The words of Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker rejecting an ICE detention center in his state‍—‍“While I support the enforcement of immigration law, I write to express my opposition to this acquisition and the proposed detention center”—are beginning to read like a form letter.

The administration is doing more than just buying up some vacant space here or there. It’s creating a new model for processing, holding, and deporting people in its custody. In this hub-and-spoke system, “smaller” (still enormous) warehouses would be used as roughly 1,500-bed processing sites that feed into larger, 5,000-to-10,000-bed detention centers, from which deportations would be staged. This would achieve the administration’s goals of deporting immigrants more efficiently and at greater scale. If this sounds like an Amazon distribution system, that’s by design. In the immortal 2025 words of Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, the deportation machine should be like “Prime, but with human beings.”

Ever since proposed locations for these warehouse purchases were published a couple of months ago, and coinciding with the sharp decline in ICE’s public image following a pair of killings in Minnesota, local pushback has been strong. Municipal meetings overflow with complaints, and local officials do what they can to push back. On the same January day ICE was spotted touring a building in Kansas City for a detention center, for example, the city council passed a resolution banning nonmunicipal detention centers for five years, though the fight goes on. A Canadian developer who owned a warehouse in Ashland, Virginia, that DHS was looking to purchase took the property off the market following public outcry. The owners of another warehouse in Oklahoma City, similarly, cut off talks with DHS. The Oklahoma City mayor, in a Facebook post, wrote that “I commend the owners for their decision and thank them on behalf of the people of Oklahoma City.”

That mayor is a Republican. A lot of these local officials at the 23 sites DHS is eyeing are Republicans. Their concerns don’t necessarily touch on the humanity of what ICE is doing, or present a conscientious case against the erection of a mass prison network. Instead, the arguments are more about disruptions to communities that aren’t situated to handle this—and weren’t given opportunities to explain this before DHS proceeded. And those complaints from local Republicans have fed up to their Republican national officials.

In his Feb. 4 letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Wicker laid out his case against a proposed ICE detention center in Byhalia, Mississippi. It covers most of the points that other Republicans, in similar situations, have been making.

Wicker argued that the location was “positioned for economic development purposes” and that “converting this industrial asset into an ICE detention center forecloses economic growth opportunities and replaces them with a use that does not generate comparable economic returns or community benefits.” Further, mass detention facilities put strains on local resources (“transportation access, water, sewer and energy costs, staffing, medical care, and emergency services”), as human beings have needs that Amazon Prime packages do not. Last, Wicker pointed to “public safety” concerns from the community. Understandably so, given that the Trump administration has sold its enforcement regime as necessary because undocumented immigrants are hardened killers from mental institutions.

“I look forward to your prompt response,” Wicker concluded, and then pointedly reminded her to “keep me informed of this acquisition and any future ICE contracting proposals affecting the state of Mississippi.” Wicker noted shortly thereafter that Noem told him she would search for a new location.

Not everyone has been so lucky. DHS has made successful acquisitions despite similar concerns elsewhere. DHS closed on a warehouse in Surprise, Arizona, late last month, paying $70 million in cash, much to the, well, surprise of the local government. This earned a rebuke not just from Democratic senators or state leaders, but from Rep. Paul Gosar, a far-right member of Congress who was vehemently anti-immigration before it was cool. In a Feb. 4 letter to Noem, Gosar—after a few paragraphs of throat-clearing about his strong support for ICE—asked 15 questions about how the hell Surprise, Arizona, is expected to absorb this, and why the city wasn’t consulted about it at all.

The small town of Social Circle, Georgia, with a population of about 5,000 people, also recently learned that it, against its wishes, would be getting an ICE detention facility that could double or triple its population in a matter of months. (It’s not hard to find the specific warehouses. Do a map search of the town name, and it’s usually the biggest rectangular structure.) The retrofitted warehouse could begin receiving detainees by April. This prompted Social Circle’s congressman, Mike Collins, a MAGA social media gadfly who’s now running for Senate, to pipe up.

“Although I am aligned with the mission of ICE to detain and deport the criminal illegal aliens who have flooded across our border due to Joe Biden’s reckless policies,” Collins wrote on Facebook earlier this month, “I agree with the community that Social Circle does not have the sufficient resources that this facility would require.”

These are just a few examples. There’s bipartisan opposition to a proposed processing facility in Chester, New York. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, who didn’t vote for the OBBBA but is certainly Democrats’ most pro-immigration-enforcement senator, wrote his own letter of complaint to Noem about two facilities reportedly under consideration for Pennsylvania. The offices of Texas’ two Republican senators didn’t respond with their positions regarding three facilities reportedly eyed for their state—though Sen. John Cornyn’s office passed along floor remarks noting his support for funding DHS and ICE—and neither did the offices of Missouri’s two Republican senators regarding the proposed Kansas City megawarehouse.

DHS, too, did not respond for comment about the pushback, and whether it had adequately discussed its purchase plans with stakeholders.

The lack of consultation across the map, though, doesn’t look like an oversight. This is how White House policy chief Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s mass deportation agenda, runs his government: Act fast because time is ticking, and deal with—or steamroll past—individual complaints after the fact. It does not take a genius to understand that members or senators might vote for one thing and then complain when it threatens to overwhelm their local sewer systems, or places detention camps within a mile of elementary schools. “Mass deportation” as a slogan to rev up the base was one thing; in practice, every step of the process‍—‍from the mass deployments of agents to the construction of detention—burns enthusiasm for the project. The administration is doing what it can, as quickly as it can, before the luster is gone altogether.

Last week, two Democrats in the Senate hosted a “bicameral public forum to receive testimony on the violent tactics and disproportionate use of force by agents of the Department of Homeland Security.” Here in Minnesota, we continue to deal with the thousands of immigration enforcement agents who have unleashed unspeakable violence on our state. Flights leave daily with men, women, and children, some of whom are citizens, green-card holders, or asylum-seekers with pending cases, to detention centers with a prevailing culture of abuse. Countless other legal observers and protesters, including myself, have been handcuffed and detained for hours without being charged with a crime, or intimidated with weapons and threats.

In the spirit of the public forum held in the District of Columbia last week, I collected the following set of comments ICE agents have made to my community, pulled from video recordings, sworn affidavits, and media reports. (A sourced list of these interactions is being compiled here.) We may not know their names or see their faces, but we hear what they say.

Agent standing in front of a truck and aiming a gun at Adan Nunez Gonzalez, while other agents rip Gonzalez out of his vehicle. Gonzalez was an asylum-seeker with no criminal record but was deported to Mexico. Nov. 11.

Agent standing in front of a car with an assault rifle pointed at the driver. Dec. 7.

After moving in front of Renee Good’s car, then shooting her three times. Jan 7.

Responding to a civilian shouting “I’m a physician!” The physician was desperate to try to check Good’s pulse and offer help but was told to stay back. Emergency services arrived later but were unable to save her life. Jan. 7.

To a Somali citizen told to prove his citizenship. Jan. 7.

To a pastor released after a warrantless detainment. He had been detained because he said he wasn’t afraid of them. An agent pointed a gun at him and asked, “Are you afraid now?” They handcuffed him, and agents repeatedly asked, “Are you afraid yet?” He kept responding no until he was eventually released. Jan. 7.

To an Ojibwe citizen born in Minneapolis, according to his sister, who saw his arrest. He was punched, handcuffed, and held at the Whipple Federal Building for hours. Jan. 8.

To a Somali legal resident after tackling him without identifying themselves, putting him in a headlock, shoving him inside an unmarked car to check for his documentation status, then releasing him. Jan. 8.

To a 5-foot-5, 120-pound woman with a medical condition. She lost consciousness after being yanked up off the ground. Jan. 9.

To a Hispanic legal resident. The agents then took $130 out of his wallet. Jan. 10.

To a Hispanic citizen born in Minnesota. Jan. 11.

To a Somali citizen desperately trying to get her husband to text a photo of her passport. She was subsequently handcuffed, driven around for an hour, and dropped off in a random parking lot. Jan. 12.

While pointing assault rifles at a terrified woman, who asked if they had a warrant and pleaded with them to stop because there were children inside the house they were breaking into. Jan. 12.

After crashing into a Hispanic citizen’s car. The anonymous agent did not leave any insurance information. Jan. 12.

To an autistic woman with a brain injury who stumbled across agents on the way to a medical appointment. They cut her seat belt, dragged her out of the vehicle by each of her limbs, laughed at her, and drove her to Whipple, where she was denied medical treatment and lost consciousness. Jan. 13.

While brandishing a window-breaking tool to threaten a citizen showing their ID through the window. Jan. 14.

While arresting a Somali citizen. Jan. 14.

To a Somali citizen screaming in pain as his arms were twisted behind him. He responded, “My country is the USA.” Jan. 15.

Responding to the question “Why would you pepper-spray a 15-year-old kid?” Jan. 15.

To a Hmong citizen after breaking down his door, pointing guns at his family, then dragging him outside and into an unmarked car in nothing but his boxers and a pair of Crocs. Jan. 18.

Mocking the shocked witnesses who saw Alex Pretti shot 10 times. Jan. 24.

While shooting chemical weapons at protesters at the site of Pretti’s death minutes later. Jan. 24.

As they detained a restaurant worker who had the necessary documents. Instead of bringing him back, agents sent him to a Texas detention center that night, before his loved ones could bring him his medication. Feb. 2.

            <div id="article-text">APRICOT 2026 When members of the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre got their chance to grill its leaders at yesterday’s annual general meeting, they didn’t hold back.

Questions from the floor came thick and fast: Does the organization need someone on the board who isn’t a male engineer? Why were its finances so strained that frontline staff were let go? Why does it take the organization a year to reply to some correspondence? Is APNIC doing enough to support its Foundation? Has it used tricky accounting?

Similarly sharp questions came earlier in the week at the APRICOT conference that precedes the AGM. Why do so many vendors still not enable IPv6 by default? Is it a good idea to accelerate depletion of IPv4 so unused addresses are put to work sooner rather than later? Is it possible to secure an organization with only open-source tools?

Overseeing all that debate – and APNIC itself – is director general Jia Rong Low, who as leader of the organization has enormous influence over how the internet is governed on behalf of over four billion people – the largest population served by any of the four regional internet registries.

In conversation with The Register, Low was entirely comfortable with the robust conversations at the twin events, and said he wants more of them, more often. But he thinks it might take the equivalent of civics lessons to make that happen.

“For a lot of members, their initial interaction is they pay us for IP addresses,” he said, before lamenting that the transaction means members consider themselves customers and don’t contemplate the opportunities and obligations that come from being part of an open organization like APNIC.

Low therefore wants APNIC’s members to understand that they can influence the organization, as contributors to policies or as representatives on special interest groups or elected members of the APNIC executive council, its equivalent of a board.

“I have members ask me for more IP addresses,” he told The Register. “As staff, I can’t change that. I tell them they can update our policy to do that. I think in the past year we&#39;re communicating more of that to members.”

Late in 2025, the United Nations sent a very similar message when it voted to persist with current multistakeholder internet governance structures that see ICANN, ISOC, the IETF, regional internet registries and other bodies work in concert to operate, build and secure the internet without government control.

Low welcomed that decision, because he believes the success of the internet shows that multistakeholder management works.

But he thinks that ongoing success, at least at APNIC, means improving the organization’s ability to engage more stakeholders.

Doing so means finding ways to engage people in ways they find culturally appropriate and comfortable, so they feel comfortable participating in governance forums.

Low is a proficient speaker of Vietnamese and explained that there is a hierarchy built into the language that means conversations open with exchanges that determine the age of participants. The language used in a conversation then changes to reflect a speaker’s seniority.

English is the dominant language at APNIC events, and in its many online discussions. Low won’t push for that to change but does want to make sure that APNIC can create an environment in which all its members can express themselves comfortably so the organization can tap their ideas and energy.

Doing so will mean APNIC follows the core tenets of multistakeholder internet governance – bottom-up and open standards development processes in which anyone can participate – and encourages more stakeholders to participate.

Low has taken some steps towards this goal, by re-framing audits of IP address holdings as “reviews” and changing the process to make checks more collaborative and educational so they feel like outreach instead of enforcement. He’s also continued to scope establishing an APNIC entity in a country other than its Australian headquarters. He plans to define more of this effort when working on a five-year strategic plan APNIC will deliver next year to cover 2028 through 2032.

APNIC’s AGM ended with an election that saw three executive council members re-elected, meaning the sole female candidate did not win a seat. Members also voted to extend executive council members terms from two to three years, but to limit representatives to three terms. ®

            <h2>Samsung says it's first to ship HBM4, a day after Micron revealed its own sales</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/samsung_and_micron_start_shipping/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Samsung and Micron say they’ve started shipping HBM4 memory, the faster and denser RAM needed to power the next generation of AI acceleration hardware.

Samsung yesterday announced it has begun mass production of HBM4 and even shipped some to an unnamed customer – probably Nvidia, which has confirmed its forthcoming Vera Rubin kit will use the memory.

The Korean giant says its memory delivers a consistent processing speed of 11.7 gigabits-per-second, but users can juice that to hit 13Gbps under some circumstances. Total memory bandwidth can reach 3.3 terabytes-per-second in a single stack.

For now, Samsung can sell this stuff in capacities between 24 and 36 gigabytes, but already plans to reach 48GB.

Memory is so hot right now, but Samsung claims it has enhanced thermal resistance by 10 percent and heat dissipation by 30 percent, compared to HBM3E. The company also claims this new memory is 40 percent more energy efficient, meaning this kit uses less electricity and runs cooler, suggesting users can look forward to slower growth in their energy bills.

The Korean giant didn’t say what it will charge for this memory, an item of interest given soaring memory prices. But it did forecast its HBM sales will more than triple in 2026 compared to 2025, and that it expects to ship samples of HBM4E in the second half of 2026.

Samsung claimed it is first to crank up production of HBM4 and ship it, but a day earlier rival memory-maker Micron said it was also cranking out the chips.

Speaking at an event hosted by Wolfe Research, Micron CFO Mark Murphy decided to “address some recent inaccurate reporting by some on our HBM4 position” by revealing the company has also started high-volume HBM4 production and shipped some to customers.

“Our HBM yield is on track. Our HBM4 yield is on track. Our HBM4 product delivers over 11 gigabits per second speeds, and we&#39;re highly confident in our HBM4 product performance and quality and reliability,” he said, adding that Micron delivered product a quarter earlier than previously forecast. He also noted that Micron has pre-sold every single HBM4 chip it can make this year.

The news from Samsung and Micron means SK Hynix is the only major memory-maker yet to announce it has started production of HBM4.

Nvidia plans to release its Vera Rubin accelerators in the second quarter of 2026, and to use memory from Samsung and SK Hynix. Samsung’s news therefore matters to those who want Nvidia’s latest and greatest, and investors who hope the GPU giant can continue its exceptional growth.

Investors seem to have enjoyed Micron’s news, as its share price spiked almost ten percent on news of its early HBM4 production.

For the rest of us, HBM4 production may bring the misery of price rises for lesser memory, because Samsung and others have shifted production capacity to high-margin products for AI applications, causing prices for other products to soar. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/cloudflare_markdown_for_ai_crawlers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cloudflare has turned its attention from erecting bot barriers to dangling bot bait.

Having previously devised a mechanism to make AI crawlers pay to consume website content, the content delivery network is now offering web publishers a way to make it cheaper for AI services to harvest site content by converting HTML to Markdown, the minimalist markup language for representing text mixed with formatting characters in a way that retains legibility.

In a blog post, Cloudflare engineering director Celso Martinho and VP Will Allen explain that AI crawlers and software agents, which constitute a growing portion of web traffic, find it easier to digest documents formatted in Markdown than traditional HTML web pages.

The reason is that HTML web pages often contain a lot of characters that describe formatting and identifiers unrelated to the semantic content, and chewing through all those tags and related markup such has a computational cost.

&quot;Feeding raw HTML to an AI is like paying by the word to read packaging instead of the letter inside,&quot; explain Martinho and Allen. &quot;A simple ## About Us on a page in markdown costs roughly 3 tokens; its HTML equivalent – <h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot; id=&quot;about&quot;>About Us</h2> – burns 12-15, and that&#39;s before you account for the <div> wrappers, nav bars, and script tags that pad every real web page and have zero semantic value.&quot;

To make web content easier for AI crawlers to chew, Cloudflare&#39;s network can now respond to crawler network requests in Markdown rather than HTML. To make this happen, an AI crawler in its network negotiation submits the Accept negotiation header with text/markdown as one of the options.

If a site publisher enables Markdown, Cloudflare&#39;s network will answer with a response header formatted in the language, plus an x-markdown-tokens header that includes the token count. That&#39;s potentially useful for calculating whether the incoming content will fit within the model&#39;s context window or whether it needs to be broken up into a series of smaller chunks.

For a web page like the Cloudflare blog post, Markdown delivery reduces the number of tokens used from 16,180 in HTML to 3,150 in Markdown, a savings of 80 percent.

The Markdown option, which is available for HTML but not other document formats like PDF, complements another recently deployed capability, the company&#39;s Content Signals Policy.

Content Signals Policy is a framework for adding machine-readable instructions to a website&#39;s robots.txt file, an implementation of the Robots Exclusion Protocol that allows publishers to communicate how they expect bots and crawlers to engage with their site. It exists to specify content usage preferences more precisely.

A site&#39;s Content Signals Policy is expressed in a robots.txt directive that declares three key-value pairs. For example:

The parameters specify whether content can be used for AI training, for AI search, and for AI input (post-training uses like retrieval augmented generation or model grounding).

As part of robots.txt, Content Signals Policy directives are voluntary; they do not represent technical protection measures.

According to Martinho and Allen, coding agents like Claude Code and OpenCode already ask for Markdown in their Accept headers. Web publishers can now cater to automated clients if they choose. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ai-pocalypse AI will not replace the people in the call center, but it will rejigger the software stack to make agents more capable of solving customer issues without the need to swivel-chair into multiple systems or escalate complaints, said Vasili Triant, CEO of UJET.

&quot;The problem actually is the systems themselves, not the humans. It&#39;s what the humans have to deal with,&quot; Triant said. &quot;So we believe AI has a huge, huge implication and impact on the customer experience base. We just believe it&#39;s going to happen a different way than all the messages happening today. So instead of the ROI being &#39;I’m going to remove humans.&#39; Your ROI becomes &#39;I&#39;m not spending money on a legacy application that doesn’t need to be there anymore.&#39; &quot;

UJET is a cloud platform that uses automation and AI to improve a call center agent&#39;s ability to solve customer problems and provides its customers with call center data tracking and analytics. Its customers include wellness brand GNC, shoemaker Alto, cookware brand Lodge, and the point-of-sale platform Zettle.

The notion that emerging AI capability will replace call center employees has been touted by Tata Consultancy Services and by startups such as LimeChat, but they don’t account for the massive amount of automation that has already happened over the last 30 years as corporations have given customers self-service abilities around bank balances, wire transfers, billing, reservations, and password resets, Triant said.

&quot;There&#39;s a lot of companies that have already tried doing the body replacement, like companies that we&#39;re even dealing with, and they&#39;re like, &#39;Okay, we put this stuff in. We ramped it all up,&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;It does some good simple things, but it&#39;s not replacing the body, like the ROI is not panning out on that stuff.&quot;

Two weeks ago, Gartner released a report saying that by 2030 the cost per resolution for generative AI in customer service will exceed $3, higher than the cost of many B2C offshore human agents. Analysts attributed the increase to rising data center costs, a pivot from subsidized growth to profitability among AI vendors, and increasingly complex use cases that consume more tokens and require expensive talent.

&quot;Customer service leaders are determined to use AI to reduce costs, but return on those investments is far from guaranteed,&quot; said Patrick Quinlan, senior director analyst in the Gartner customer service and support practice. &quot;Full automation will be prohibitively expensive for most organizations; instead, leading organizations will use AI to drive customer engagement rather than to cut costs.&quot;

Gartner also predicts that by 2028, regulatory changes related to AI will increase assisted service volume by 30 percent.

&quot;Regulations mandating easy access to human agents will encourage customers to request a human by default, bypassing AI agents,&quot; said Quinlan. &quot;As a result, organizations will have to maintain or even rehire human agents, possibly at higher numbers or at a higher salary than they previously paid. Failure to maintain appropriate staffing levels could lead to deterioration of the customer experience, with customers waiting for long periods to speak to a human.&quot;

Triant said he has already seen that happen among customers.

&quot;You put the technology in, you start running it, and either your users are bypassing it to get to the live agent, or they&#39;re not happy with that, which means you&#39;re not driving better customer experience,&quot; he said. &quot;Your spending goes up, while the problem stays the same.&quot;

One of UJET’s large financial customers had automated 80 percent of its call center work before the AI wave hit, Triant said. They see the next stage of efficiency coming from curating the applications its employees use to fix customer complaints, not reducing the number of people working in the call center.

&quot;The people that are talking to you and I, when we call in for a need, have way too many tools, and it&#39;s so complex,&quot; he said. &quot;&#39;Oh, hold on. Let me get to that screen. Hold on. That&#39;s trying to load. Hold on, my application is running slow.&#39; It&#39;s the same story we all know. And when you look at that, the problem is they have so many different things that they have to deal with to get the information they need to solve your problem.&quot;

The sentiment felt by Triant’s customers is helping to fuel the so-called SaaS-pocalypse, which has seen the value of some bellwether software companies fluctuate wildly as investors and the software industry reevaluate the enterprise application stack against the capabilities of artificial intelligence.

Triant said just as UJET isn’t firing its engineers, it is arming them with AI to maximize individual production; its call center customers are looking for ways to do the same thing with their staff.

&quot;How do we take those, the real good knowledge workers and agents, and how do we make them superheroes?&quot; he said. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/30_chrome_extensions_ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than 30 malicious Chrome extensions installed by at least 260,000 users purport to be helpful AI assistants, but they steal users&#39; API keys, email messages, and other personal data. Even worse: many of these are still available on the Chrome Web Store as of this writing.

Some of these extensions impersonate specific chatbots such as Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, while others claim to be more generic AI assistant tools to help users summarize documents, write messages, and provide Gmail assistance.

Despite different names and extension IDs, they all use the same underlying codebase and permissions, and all 32 extensions communicate with infrastructure under the tapnetic[.]pro domain, according to LayerX Security, which uncovered the campaign and named it AiFrame.

Some of them were published under new IDs after earlier versions were removed. For example, AI Sidebar (gghdfkafnhfpaooiolhncejnlgglhkhe), which had 50,000 users at the time of LayerX Security’s report, appeared after the earlier Gemini AI Sidebar (fppbiomdkfbhgjjdmojlogeceejinadg), which had 80,000 users, was removed from the Chrome Web Store. The Register found that the re-uploaded extension (gghdfkafnhfpaooiolhncejnlgglhkhe) is now listed with 70,000 users as of publication.

Google did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries about the malicious extensions.

All 32 extension IDs are listed in LayerX&#39;s report, so be sure to check it out before adding any AI assistant extension to your browser.

Another extension that is still available at the time of this writing is called AI Assistant (nlhpidbjmmffhoogcennoiopekbiglbp) and has 60,000 users. This one, which garnered the &quot;Featured&quot; badge on the Chrome Web Store, points users to a remote domain (claude.tapnetic.pro).

It has an iframe overlay that visually appears as the extension&#39;s interface, and this iframe allows the operator to load remote content, changing the UI and logic, and silently adding new capabilities at any time without any Chrome Web Store update required.

&quot;When instructed by the iframe, the extension queries the active tab and invokes a content script that extracts readable article content using Mozilla&#39;s Readability library,&quot; LayerX Security researcher Natalie Zargarov wrote. &quot;The extracted data includes titles, text content, excerpts, and site metadata.&quot;

The extension then sends this data - including authentication details for any page the user is viewing - back to the remote iframe.

In addition to snarfing up all sorts of page content from every website a user visits, this particular extension also supports speech recognition. It transcribes the user&#39;s words and sends them back to the remote page for the operator to read.

Interestingly, nearly half of the extensions target Gmail and share the same Gmail integration codebase. This allows the extension to read visible email content directly from the DOM and extract message text via textContent from Gmail&#39;s conversation view. This includes email thread content and even draft or compose-related text, which is then sent to remote servers.

&quot;The campaign exploits the conversational nature of AI interactions, which has conditioned users to share detailed information,&quot; Zargarov said in an email. &quot;By injecting iframes that mimic trusted AI interfaces, they&#39;ve created a nearly invisible man-in-the-middle attack that intercepts everything from API keys to personal data before it ever reaches the legitimate service.&quot; ®

Last month, OpenAI signed a $10 billion contract with Cerebras to deploy up to 750 megawatts of its custom AI silicon to serve up Altman and crew&#39;s latest generation of GPT models.

Cerebras&#39; waferscale architecture is notable for using a kind of ultra-fast, on-chip memory called SRAM, which is roughly 1,000x faster than the HBM4 found on Nvidia&#39;s upcoming Rubin GPUs announced at CES earlier this year.

This, along with optimizations to the inference and application pipelines, allows OpenAI&#39;s latest model to churn out answers in the blink of an eye.

As Spark is a proprietary model, we don&#39;t have all the details on things like parameter count, as we would if OpenAI had released it on HuggingFace like it did with gpt-oss back in August. What we do know is, just like that model, it&#39;s a text-only model with a 128,000-token context window.

If you&#39;re not familiar, a model&#39;s context window refers to how many tokens (words, punctuation, numbers, etc) it can keep track of at any one time. Because of this, it&#39;s often referred to as the model&#39;s short-term memory.

While 128K tokens might sound like a lot, because the model has to keep track of both existing and newly generated code, code assistants like Codex can blow through that pretty quickly. Even starting from a blank slate, at 1,000 tokens a second it would take roughly two minutes to overflow the context limit.

This might be why OpenAI says Spark defaults to a &quot;lightweight&quot; style that only makes minimal targeted edits and won&#39;t run debug tests unless specifically asked.

A fast model isn&#39;t much good if it can&#39;t write working code. If OpenAI is to be believed, the Spark model delivers greater accuracy than GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini in Terminal-Bench 2.0 while also being much, much faster than its smarter GPT-5.3-Codex model.

OpenAI may be looking beyond GPUs, but it&#39;s certainly not abandoning them anytime soon.

&quot;GPUs remain foundational across our training and inference pipelines and deliver the most cost effective tokens for broad usage. Cerebras complements that foundation by excelling at workflows that demand extremely low latency,&quot; OpenAI wrote.

This isn&#39;t just lip service. As fast as Cerebra&#39;s CS3 accelerators are, they can&#39;t match modern GPUs on memory capacity. SRAM may be fast, but it&#39;s not space efficient. The entire dinner-place-sized chip contains just 44 GB of memory. By comparison, Nvidia&#39;s Rubin will ship with 288 GB of HBM4 while AMD&#39;s MI455X will pack on 432 GB.

This makes GPUs more economical for running very large models, especially if speed isn&#39;t a priority. Having said that, OpenAI suggests that as Cerebras brings more compute online, it&#39;ll be bringing its larger models to the compute platform, presumably for those willing to pay a premium for high-speed inference.

GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is currently available in preview to Codex Pro users and via API to select OpenAI partners. ®

Sony is remaking the original God of War trilogy, too.

To close out its February 2026 State of Play presentation, Sony revealed God of War Sons of Sparta, a new prequel 2D side scroller in the God of War franchise, and announced that it’s out right now on PlayStation 5.

”God of War Sons of Sparta is a 2D action platformer with a canon story set in Kratos’ youth during his harsh training at the Agoge alongside his brother Deimos,” Sony says. Over the course of the game, Kratos will “learn deadly skills using his spear and shield, as well as harness powerful divine artifacts known as the Gifts of Olympus to take on a wide array of foes.”

Sony’s Santa Monica Studio collaborated on the game with Mega Cat Studios. It costs $29.99, with a Digital Deluxe version available for $39.99.

Sony also announced that it’s working on a remake of the original God of War trilogy, with TC Carson set to return as the voice of Kratos. However, the project is “still very early in development, so we ask for your patience as it will be a while before anything else can be shared,” according to Sony. “When we can come back with an update, we aim to make it a big one!”

            <h2>Ring cancels its partnership with Flock Safety after surveillance backlash</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following mounting pressure and a questionable Super Bowl ad, the Amazon-owned company walked back its plan to integrate with the controversial law-enforcement technology company.

Following mounting pressure and a questionable Super Bowl ad, the Amazon-owned company walked back its plan to integrate with the controversial law-enforcement technology company.

Following intense backlash to its partnership with Flock Safety, a surveillance technology company that works with law enforcement agencies, Ring has announced it is canceling the integration.

In a statement published on Ring’s blog and provided to The Verge ahead of publication, the company said: “Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. We therefore made the joint decision to cancel the integration and continue with our current partners … The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.”

The statement goes on to say that Ring’s mission to make neighborhoods safer “comes with significant responsibility — to our customers, to the communities we serve, and to the trust you place in our products and features.”

Trust is the big one there. Over the last few weeks, the company has faced significant public anger over its connection to Flock, with Ring users being encouraged to smash their cameras, and some announcing on social media that they are throwing away their Ring devices.

The Flock partnership was announced last October, but following recent unrest across the country related to ICE activities, public pressure against the Amazon-owned Ring’s involvement with the company started to mount.

Flock has reportedly allowed ICE and other federal agencies to access its network of surveillance cameras, and influencers across social media have been claiming that Ring is providing a direct link to ICE.

While that claim is not accurate, as the Flock integration has never gone live, Ring has a history of partnering with police, and the new partnership quickly came under intense criticism.

Adding fuel to the fire, this weekend Ring aired a Super Bowl ad for its new AI-powered Search Party feature. While the company says the feature is designed to find lost dogs and maintains it’s not capable of finding people, the ad raised fears that Ring cameras were being used for mass surveillance. The ad shows dozens of Ring cameras in a neighborhood scanning the streets.

On top of this, the company recently launched a new facial recognition feature, Familiar Faces. Combined with Search Party, the technological leap to using neighborhood cameras to search for people through a mass-surveillance network suddenly seems very small.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) – a longtime critic of Ring – sent an open letter this week calling on Amazon to cancel the company’s facial recognition feature.

Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger said in an email that its products are purpose-driven tech, “not tools for mass surveillance.” She added that “Familiar Faces is an opt-in feature designed to give customers more control over the alerts they receive (e.g., ‘Mom at front door’ instead of ‘Someone at front door’) while keeping their data protected.”

Ring’s partnership with Flock was announced in October 2025 as part of Ring’s Community Requests program, which launched last September. It was designed to allow local law enforcement agencies that use Flock’s software to integrate directly with the program.

Community Requests launched after Ring ended its controversial Requests for Assistance (RFA) program, which consumer advocacy groups criticized for allowing video to be provided to police without a warrant, calling it a threat to civil liberties.

In its statement about the Flock cancellation, Ring maintains that Community Requests will continue, claiming it helped authorities locate a suspect during the recent Brown University shooting:

“When a shooting occurred near Brown University in December 2025, every second mattered. The Providence Police Department turned to their community for help, putting out a Community Request. Within hours, 7 neighbors responded, sharing 168 videos that captured critical moments from the incident. One video identified a new key witness, helping lead police to identify the suspect’s vehicle and solve the case. With a shooter at large, the community faced uncertainty about their safety. Neighbors who chose to share footage played a crucial role in neutralizing the threat and restoring safety to their community.”

As with RFA, Community Requests still allows public safety agencies to request video footage from users in a certain area during an active investigation, but it differs from the previous program because law enforcement agencies are required to partner with a third-party evidence management system – such as Flock – to use the service. Ring says this is to better maintain the chain of custody. The previous system allowed police to request footage directly from a user.

Flock was the second partner Ring announced for Community Requests, the first being Axon, a law enforcement technology company known for making Tasers. With the new service, only law enforcement agencies that use these companies’ software can submit requests. But the end result is the same: law enforcement gets video from users if they choose to share it.

Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger says the Axon partnership is unaffected by the end of the Flock integration. Additionally, she says no other integrations are currently being explored.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Strap in, because the next PlayStation event is going to be a long one. Sony’s latest State of Play — a showcase event for upcoming PS5 games — kicks off on February 12th at 5PM ET and it’ll last more than an hour.

We don’t know what exactly will be shown. Sony says that the event will include “news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe.” However, it sounds like one of the biggest upcoming PS5 games, Insomniac’s bloody take on Wolverine, might not make an appearance. Most likely the event will feature a mixture of some of Sony’s tentpole single-player experiences from studios like Naughty Dog, along with its continued (albeit scaled back) push into live-service games through upcoming titles like Horizon Hunters Gathering and Bungie’s return to Marathon.

You can watch the event live on both Twitch and YouTube, and stay tuned here for all of the most important and interesting reveals and announcements.

In addition to another remaster, the Legacy of Kain series is getting a new 2D action game called Ascendance. This is the first installment since 2003’s Defiance.

The trailer was published alongside other State of Play announcements but seemingly left out of livestream. It’s launching March 31st.

To close out its February 2026 State of Play presentation, Sony revealed God of War Sons of Sparta, a new prequel 2D side scroller in the God of War franchise, and announced that it’s out right now on PlayStation 5.

”God of War Sons of Sparta is a 2D action platformer with a canon story set in Kratos’ youth during his harsh training at the Agoge alongside his brother Deimos,” Sony says. Over the course of the game, Kratos will “learn deadly skills using his spear and shield, as well as harness powerful divine artifacts known as the Gifts of Olympus to take on a wide array of foes.”

Big Walk by developer House House has another trailer showing off its immaculate “friendslop” vibes. The game is due out “later this year” on both PlayStation 5 and PC, with full crossplay support between them. On PS5, it will be included in the PlayStation Plus Essential tier.

It’s now in development, but still in the “early stages.”

The latest trailer for the 2D fighter Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls reveals a squad featuring X-Men like Wolverine and Storm. The game looks ridiculous in the best possible way, and is launching on August 6th on both the PS5 and PC.

In a new trailer, Housemarque showed off things like the game’s main hub, the skill tree, a way to fast-travel to different locations, and how eclipses will change the game’s world. Saros launches on April 30th.

Bungie’s return to the Marathon universe launches very soon — March 5th! — so here’s a new trailer that sort of gets across what the extraction shooter will be like. You can try it out early with a “server slam” event from February 26th to March 2nd.

Right now it’s just called the Untitled John Wick Game, so it seems really early in development. It will feature an “original script set in the John Wick timeline.” The game is a “collaboration between Saber, Lionsgate, and franchise director Chad Stahelski.”

Silent Hill: Townfall is set to launch sometime in 2026, and Konami will be hosting a dedicated showcase about the game at 7PM ET.

Metal Gear Solid Master Collection is getting a second volume that includes Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. MGS4 has been locked away on the PlayStation 3 since 2008, but come August 27th it’ll finally be playable on modern systems.

Yes, it’s true, Konami remembered that the vampire-slaying series exists, and the new game looks sick as hell. It”s described as a “2D action-exploration” developed Evil Empire and Motion Twin, of Dead Cells fame. Launching later this year.

Krafton’s Project Windless has a new trailer, showing more of its world and vibes based on the The Bird That Drinks Tears novel series . There’s no launch details, but there’s a whole lot of big chicken man cutting down armies of baddies.

Here’s yet another glimpse at Hitman developer IO’s take on a youthful James Bond, which is launching on May 27th.

Star Wars: Galactic Racer launches in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC, and Sony just showed off gameplay in a new trailer. There’s even some podracing!

Yacht Club Games’ next title was delayed last year, and it will now launch sometime in spring 2026. The game is “larger than all of the Shovel Knight games combined,” Yacht Club Games says in a press release.

Update: Added information from press release.

The gorgeous adventure Neva is getting a prequel that looks just as beautiful and will probably be just as heartbreaking. The DLC launches on February 19th.

Based on a new trailer, Game Freak’s next game could be shaping up into something special.

Remedy showed off its upcoming Control sequel in action, and it sure looks like it emphasizes the action part of action-adventure game. It’s due out later this year.

I don’t know how many Nosgoth enjoyers there are these days, but the peak of the series is coming back for us. Legacy of Kain: Defiance Remastered, also known as the one where you get to play as both Kain and Raziel, launches March 3rd.

Dead or Alive 6 Last Round is coming to PS5 on June 26th. There is also a new entry of the series in development.

Capcom’s sci-fi action game has been getting a lot of screen time lately — it was just featured at last week’s Nintendo Direct — but the newest trailer is a little quieter and slower, giving you a taste of the game’s atmosphere.

Sony will be publishing it, and thanks to a new trailer, now we can get a sense of 4 Loop’s co-operative, roguelike-y gameplay. The team is led by Left 4 Dead designer Mike Booth, so I’m optimistic that it will be a good multiplayer game. You can sign up for playtests now.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is coming to PC on March 19th, after previously being a PlayStation 5 exclusive. It’ll feature unlocked framerates, ultrawide support, upscaling, and frame generation.

The excellent samurai action game Ghost of Yōtei’s multiplayer expansion Legends is launching on March 10th, and it looks to bring a lot more Japanese folklore into the mix, as four-player squads will fight all kinds of mythological creatures.

Kena: Scars of Kosmora is a new sequel to 2021’s Kena: Bridge of Spirits. It’s launching on PlayStation and PC sometime in 2026.

            <h2>In one swoop, Trump kills US greenhouse gas regulations</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/science/877371/trump-carbon-pollution-endangerment-finding-repeal-climate-change">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Environmental Protection Agency repealed the key finding that underpins limits on planet-heating pollution from cars and power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency repealed the key finding that underpins limits on planet-heating pollution from cars and power plants.

The Trump administration just eliminated the landmark finding that has underpinned federal regulations on planet-heating pollution since 2009.

For nearly the past two decades, the “endangerment finding” has allowed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to craft rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Rather than repealing those rules individually, the Trump administration can undermine them all at once by attacking the endangerment finding.

Today, the EPA finalized its plans to overturn the endangerment finding as part of its attempts to overhaul tailpipe pollution standards. The move could also affect efforts to curb carbon emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities that drive more extreme weather and other climate disasters. And since the US pumps out more of the carbon pollution causing climate change than any other country in the world other than China, the impact would be felt worldwide.

“It is impossible to imagine a morally defensible reason”

“It is impossible to imagine a morally defensible reason for [EPA] Administrator [Lee] Zeldin’s decision to end EPA’s responsibility for cutting the climate pollution that is endangering peoples’ health,” Dominique Browning, Moms Clean Air Force director and cofounder, said in an emailed press statement. “Zeldin’s legacy will be the suffering of our children and grandchildren.”

In 2009, when the EPA issued the endangerment finding, it recognized that greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” The World Health Organization has warned that there could be an additional 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050 due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress exacerbated by climate change.

Now, the EPA says it’s focused on slashing regulations it sees as costly for US businesses and consumers. When the agency first proposed a repeal of the endangerment finding last year, it claimed that automakers “have suffered from significant uncertainties and massive costs related to general regulations of greenhouse gases from vehicles and trucks.”

The agency announced today that it’s throwing out “all subsequent federal GHG emission standards for all vehicles and engines of model years 2012 to 2027 and beyond” by eliminating the endangerment finding. “As EPA Administrator, I am proud to deliver the single largest deregulatory action in U.S. history on behalf of American taxpayers and consumers,” Zeldin said in the press release.

The agency now says that removing regulatory requirements for greenhouse gases will cumulatively save more than $1.3 trillion, shaving $2,400 on average off the cost of a vehicle (without sharing in the press release how it arrived at that amount). The EPA previously estimated that the repeal would save $54 billion annually, although its analysis assumes that gas prices will fall and excludes additional costs incurred by the effects of climate change. Undoing tailpipe pollution rules by rescinding the endangerment finding could actually cost Americans $310 billion over the next 25 years — mostly at the gas pump — according to a report by nonpartisan climate policy think tank Energy Innovation.

The repeal is sure to face legal challenges from environmental groups. That could ultimately send the case to the Supreme Court, where President Donald Trump has appointed three of the justices making up the current 6-3 conservative majority. If that happens, the current justices could reverse the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA decision that allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act in the first place. By doing so, they’d hamstring future administrations from reinstating climate rules enabled by the endangerment finding.

Congress would have to enact legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions again at the federal level. In its announcement today, the EPA argues that the Clean Air Act does not give the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions coming from motor vehicles “for the purpose of addressing global climate change.” “A policy decision of this magnitude, which carries sweeping economic and policy consequences, lies solely with Congress,” it says.

States could also step up with their own climate pollution limits. “We can’t allow federal attacks to limit Colorado’s clean transportation ambitions,” Aaron Kressig, transportation electrification manager at the nonprofit Western Resource Advocates, said in a press release. “Now is the time for state leaders to take bold action.”

Navigating a web of different state policies could lead to greater legal risks for automakers, according to Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association. “Rescinding the endangerment finding creates huge risk and uncertainty in the regulatory framework on which sustained economic growth has depended for decades,” Gore says in a press statement. “[It] pulls the rug out from companies that have invested in manufacturing next-gen vehicles across the United States.”

Whether you’re considering a 16-inch gaming laptop, or a more compact 14-inch model, there’s a deal with your name on it happening right now at Best Buy. The 2025 models of Acer’s Predator Helios Neo 16S and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 are hundreds off, although it’s the model with the bigger screen that is currently the cheaper of the two. The sale on the Neo 16S will expire at the end of the day, while the Zephyrus G14 discount will likely be available through President’s Day.

Starting with the popular Zephyrus G14, which has a 3K resolution Pantone-validated OLED that can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate, you can get a high-end configuration at Best Buy for $1,899.99, down from its original price of $2,399.99. In addition to great screen specs, it has AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor — one of the fastest available on a laptop — plus Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti GPU with 12GB of VRAM, 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM clocked at 8,000MHz and a 1TB SSD. This model is ideal for those who want to be able to play any 2026 title at great frame rates without any (or many) compromises to visual fidelity.

For context on the price, Best Buy is offering the step-down configuration for $100 less, with a slightly worse CPU, a significantly less capable GPU (the RTX 5060), and half the RAM. You’re getting a lot of extra power with the discounted model at $1,899.99.

The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S is bigger and has a larger OLED screen, yet on the whole it’s still fairly thin for a gaming laptop. And, it starts at $1,469.99, down from $1,899.99 at Best Buy. It has comparable specs to the Zephyrus G14 — a capable processor in the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, the RTX 5070 Ti, 32GB of DDR5 6,400MHz RAM, a 1TB SSD — but its 16-inch screen is slightly lower res at 2560 x 1600 (albeit with a 240Hz refresh rate) versus 2880 x 1800 in the Zephyrus G14. Either way, you’ve got two great potential upgrades to consider.

Although it’s since been dethroned as our favorite midrange robot vacuum / mop hybrid, X10 Pro Omni remains a solid choice thanks to its excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, and user-friendly app. The dual-spinning brushes are capable of removing dried stains with 1kg of downward pressure, and a built-in water reservoir prevents the robovac from having to frequently return to the dock just to refill its tank. Unlike a lot of bots in this price range, it also benefits from heated drying function — though not heated mop washing — thus preventing the base from smelling after repeated use.

On the vacuuming front, the X10 Omni features a single rubber / bristle roller brush and 8,000Pa of suction, resulting in good performance on both carpet and tile surfaces. It offers great AI-powered object recognition, too, allowing it to deftly avoid pet messes, cables, toys, and other objects that might impede performance. Then there’s the Eufy Clean app — which lets you set schedules, establish no-go zones, and create virtual boundaries — culminating in a still-solid midrange vac. The fact that it can automatically empty its dust bin and refill its own water tank via the included multifunction dock just adds to the appeal.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money.

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

This is part of our What’s Next series, which looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect. But they represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases. Read the full story. —Jessica Hamzelou

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anton Cherepanov is always on the lookout for something interesting. And in late August last year, he spotted just that. It was a file uploaded to VirusTotal, a site cybersecurity researchers like him use to analyze submissions for potential viruses and other types of malicious software, often known as malware. On the surface it seemed innocuous, but it triggered Cherepanov’s custom malware-detecting measures. Over the next few hours, he and his colleague Peter Strýček inspected the sample and realized they’d never come across anything like it before.

The file contained ransomware, a nasty strain of malware that encrypts the files it comes across on a victim’s system, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid to the attackers behind it. But what set this example apart was that it employed large language models (LLMs). Not just incidentally, but across every stage of an attack. Once it was installed, it could tap into an LLM to generate customized code in real time, rapidly map a computer to identify sensitive data to copy or encrypt, and write personalized ransom notes based on the files’ content. The software could do this autonomously, without any human intervention. And every time it ran, it would act differently, making it harder to detect.

Cherepanov and Strýček were confident that their discovery, which they dubbed PromptLock, marked a turning point in generative AI, showing how the technology could be exploited to create highly flexible malware attacks. They published a blog post declaring that they’d uncovered the first example of AI-powered ransomware, which quickly became the object of widespread global media attention.

But the threat wasn’t quite as dramatic as it first appeared. The day after the blog post went live, a team of researchers from New York University claimed responsibility, explaining that the malware was not, in fact, a full attack let loose in the wild but a research project, merely designed to prove it was possible to automate each step of a ransomware campaign—which, they said, they had.

PromptLock may have turned out to be an academic project, but the real bad guys are using the latest AI tools. Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.

The likelihood that cyberattacks will now become more common and more effective over time is not a remote possibility but “a sheer reality,” says Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London.

Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers say this claim is overblown. “For some reason, everyone is just focused on this malware idea of, like, AI superhackers, which is just absurd,” says Marcus Hutchins, who is principal threat researcher at the security company Expel and famous in the security world for ending a giant global ransomware attack called WannaCry in 2017.

Instead, experts argue, we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams. Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. These AI-enhanced cyberattacks are only set to get more frequent and more destructive, and we need to be ready.

Attackers started adopting generative AI tools almost immediately after ChatGPT exploded on the scene at the end of 2022. These efforts began, as you might imagine, with the creation of spam—and a lot of it. Last year, a report from Microsoft said that in the year leading up to April 2025, the company had blocked $4 billion worth of scams and fraudulent transactions, “many likely aided by AI content.”

At least half of spam email is now generated using LLMs, according to estimates by researchers at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Barracuda Networks, who analyzed nearly 500,000 malicious messages collected before and after the launch of ChatGPT. They also found evidence that AI is increasingly being deployed in more sophisticated schemes. They looked at targeted email attacks, which impersonate a trusted figure in order to trick a worker within an organization out of funds or sensitive information. By April 2025, they found, at least 14% of those sorts of focused email attacks were generated using LLMs, up from 7.6% in April 2024.

In one high-profile case, a worker was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees.

And the generative AI boom has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to generate not only emails but highly convincing images, videos, and audio. The results are much more realistic than even just a few short years ago, and it takes much less data to generate a fake version of someone’s likeness or voice than it used to.

Criminals aren’t deploying these sorts of deepfakes to prank people or to simply mess around—they’re doing it because it works and because they’re making money out of it, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “If there’s money to be made and people continue to be fooled by it, they’ll continue to do it,” he says. In one high-­profile case reported in 2024, a worker at the British engineering firm Arup was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. That’s likely only the tip of the iceberg, and the problem posed by convincing deepfakes is only likely to get worse as the technology improves and is more widely adopted.

Criminals’ tactics evolve all the time, and as AI’s capabilities improve, such people are constantly probing how those new capabilities can help them gain an advantage over victims. Billy Leonard, tech leader of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, has been keeping a close eye on changes in the use of AI by potential bad actors (a widely used term in the industry for hackers and others attempting to use computers for criminal purposes). In the latter half of 2024, he and his team noticed prospective criminals using tools like Google Gemini the same way everyday users do—to debug code and automate bits and pieces of their work—as well as tasking it with writing the odd phishing email. By 2025, they had progressed to using AI to help create new pieces of malware and release them into the wild, he says.

The big question now is how far this kind of malware can go. Will it ever become capable enough to sneakily infiltrate thousands of companies’ systems and extract millions of dollars, completely undetected?

Most popular AI models have guardrails in place to prevent them from generating malicious code or illegal material, but bad actors still find ways to work around them. For example, Google observed a China-linked actor asking its Gemini AI model to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system—a request it initially refused on safety grounds. However, the attacker managed to persuade Gemini to break its own rules by posing as a participant in a capture-the-flag competition, a popular cybersecurity game. This sneaky form of jailbreaking led Gemini to hand over information that could have been used to exploit the system. (Google has since adjusted Gemini to deny these kinds of requests.)

But bad actors aren’t just focusing on trying to bend the AI giants’ models to their nefarious ends. Going forward, they’re increasingly likely to adopt open-source AI models, as it’s easier to strip out their safeguards and get them to do malicious things, says Ashley Jess, a former tactical specialist at the US Department of Justice and now a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Intel 471. “Those are the ones I think that [bad] actors are going to adopt, because they can jailbreak them and tailor them to what they need,” she says.

The NYU team used two open-source models from OpenAI in its PromptLock experiment, and the researchers found they didn’t even need to resort to jailbreaking techniques to get the model to do what they wanted. They say that makes attacks much easier. Although these kinds of open-source models are designed with an eye to ethical alignment, meaning that their makers do consider certain goals and values in dictating the way they respond to requests, the models don’t have the same kinds of restrictions as their closed-source counterparts, says Meet Udeshi, a PhD student at New York University who worked on the project. “That is what we were trying to test,” he says. “These LLMs claim that they are ethically aligned—can we still misuse them for these purposes? And the answer turned out to be yes.”

It’s possible that criminals have already successfully pulled off covert PromptLock-style attacks and we’ve simply never seen any evidence of them, says Udeshi. If that’s the case, attackers could—in theory—have created a fully autonomous hacking system. But to do that they would have had to overcome the significant barrier that is getting AI models to behave reliably, as well as any inbuilt aversion the models have to being used for malicious purposes—all while evading detection. Which is a pretty high bar indeed.

So, what do we know for sure? Some of the best data we have now on how people are attempting to use AI for malicious purposes comes from the big AI companies themselves. And their findings certainly sound alarming, at least at first. In November, Leonard’s team at Google released a report that found bad actors were using AI tools (including Google’s Gemini) to dynamically alter malware’s behavior; for example, it could self-modify to evade detection. The team wrote that it ushered in “a new operational phase of AI abuse.”

However, the five malware families the report dug into (including PromptLock) consisted of code that was easily detected and didn’t actually do any harm, the cybersecurity writer Kevin Beaumont pointed out on social media. “There’s nothing in the report to suggest orgs need to deviate from foundational security programmes—everything worked as it should,” he wrote.

It’s true that this malware activity is in an early phase, concedes Leonard. Still, he sees value in making these kinds of reports public if it helps security vendors and others build better defenses to prevent more dangerous AI attacks further down the line. “Cliché to say, but sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he says. “It doesn’t really do us any good to keep it a secret or keep it hidden away. We want people to be able to know about this— we want other security vendors to know about this—so that they can continue to build their own detections.”

And it’s not just new strains of malware that would-be attackers are experimenting with—they also seem to be using AI to try to automate the process of hacking targets. In November, Anthropic announced it had disrupted a large-scale cyberattack, the first reported case of one executed without “substantial human intervention.” Although the company didn’t go into much detail about the exact tactics the hackers used, the report’s authors said a Chinese state-sponsored group had used its Claude Code assistant to automate up to 90% of what they called a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign.”

“We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

But, as with the Google findings, there were caveats. A human operator, not AI, selected the targets before tasking Claude with identifying vulnerabilities. And of 30 attempts, only a “handful” were successful. The Anthropic report also found that Claude hallucinated and ended up fabricating data during the campaign, claiming it had obtained credentials it hadn’t and “frequently” overstating its findings, so the attackers would have had to carefully validate those results to make sure they were actually true. “This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,” the report’s authors wrote.

Existing controls within any reasonably secure organization would stop these attacks, says Gary McGraw, a veteran security expert and cofounder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in Virginia. “None of the malicious-attack part, like the vulnerability exploit … was actually done by the AI—it was just prefabricated tools that do that, and that stuff’s been automated for 20 years,” he says. “There’s nothing novel, creative, or interesting about this attack.”

Anthropic maintains that the report’s findings are a concerning signal of changes ahead. “Tying this many steps of an intrusion campaign together through [AI] agentic orchestration is unprecedented,” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, said in a statement. “It turns what has always been a labor-intensive process into something far more scalable. We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

Some are not convinced there’s reason to be alarmed. AI hype has led a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry to overestimate models’ current abilities, Hutchins says. “They want this idea of unstoppable AIs that can outmaneuver security, so they’re forecasting that’s where we’re going,” he says. But “there just isn’t any evidence to support that, because the AI capabilities just don’t meet any of the requirements.”

Indeed, for now criminals mostly seem to be tapping AI to enhance their productivity: using LLMs to write malicious code and phishing lures, to conduct reconnaissance, and for language translation. Jess sees this kind of activity a lot, alongside efforts to sell tools in underground criminal markets. For example, there are phishing kits that compare the click-rate success of various spam campaigns, so criminals can track which campaigns are most effective at any given time. She is seeing a lot of this activity in what could be called the “AI slop landscape” but not as much “widespread adoption from highly technical actors,” she says.

But attacks don’t need to be sophisticated to be effective. Models that produce “good enough” results allow attackers to go after larger numbers of people than previously possible, says Liz James, a managing security consultant at the cybersecurity company NCC Group. “We’re talking about someone who might be using a scattergun approach phishing a whole bunch of people with a model that, if it lands itself on a machine of interest that doesn’t have any defenses … can reasonably competently encrypt your hard drive,” she says. “You’ve achieved your objective.”

For now, researchers are optimistic about our ability to defend against these threats—regardless of whether they are made with AI. “Especially on the malware side, a lot of the defenses and the capabilities and the best practices that we’ve recommended for the past 10-plus years—they all still apply,” says Leonard. The security programs we use to detect standard viruses and attack attempts work; a lot of phishing emails will still get caught in inbox spam filters, for example. These traditional forms of defense will still largely get the job done—at least for now.

And in a neat twist, AI itself is helping to counter security threats more effectively. After all, it is excellent at spotting patterns and correlations. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, says that every day, the company processes more than 100 trillion signals flagged by its AI systems as potentially malicious or suspicious events.

Despite the cybersecurity landscape’s constant state of flux, Jess is heartened by how readily defenders are sharing detailed information with each other about attackers’ tactics. Mitre’s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems and the GenAI Security Project from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project are two helpful initiatives documenting how potential criminals are incorporating AI into their attacks and how AI systems are being targeted by them. “We’ve got some really good resources out there for understanding how to protect your own internal AI toolings and understand the threat from AI toolings in the hands of cybercriminals,” she says.

PromptLock, the result of a limited university project, isn’t representative of how an attack would play out in the real world. But if it taught us anything, it’s that the technical capabilities of AI shouldn’t be dismissed.New York University’s Udeshi says he wastaken aback at how easily AI was able to handle a full end-to-end chain of attack, from mapping and working out how to break into a targeted computer system to writing personalized ransom notes to victims: “We expected it would do the initial task very well but it would stumble later on, but we saw high—80% to 90%—success throughout the whole pipeline.”

AI is still evolving rapidly, and today’s systems are already capable of things that would have seemed preposterously out of reach just a few short years ago. That makes it incredibly tough to say with absolute confidence what it will—or won’t—be able to achieve in the future. While researchers are certain that AI-driven attacks are likely to increase in both volume and severity, the forms they could take are unclear. Perhaps the most extreme possibility is that someone makes an AI model capable of creating and automating its own zero-day exploits—highly dangerous cyber­attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. But building and hosting such a model—and evading detection—would require billions of dollars in investment, says Hutchins, meaning it would only be in the reach of a wealthy nation-state.

Engin Kirda, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who specializes in malware detection and analysis, says he wouldn’t be surprised if this was already happening. “I’m sure people are investing in it, but I’m also pretty sure people are already doing it, especially [in] China—they have good AI capabilities,” he says.

It’s a pretty scary possibility. But it’s one that—thankfully—is still only theoretical. A large-scale campaign that is both effective and clearly AI-driven has yet to materialize. What we can say is that generative AI is already significantly lowering the bar for criminals. They’ll keep experimenting with the newest releases and updates and trying to find new ways to trick us into parting with important information and precious cash. For now, all we can do is be careful, remain vigilant, and—for all our sakes—stay on top of those system updates.

            <h2>Why EVs are gaining ground in Africa</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/12/1132790/evs-progress-africa/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around.

But there are some signs of progress. I just finished up a story about the economic case: A recent study in Nature Energy found that EVs from scooters to minibuses could be cheaper to own than gas-powered vehicles in Africa by 2040.

If there’s one thing to know about EVs in Africa, it’s that each of the 54 countries on the continent faces drastically different needs, challenges, and circumstances. There’s also a wide range of reasons to be optimistic about the prospects for EVs in the near future, including developing policies, a growing grid, and an expansion of local manufacturing.

Even the world’s leading EV markets fall short of Ethiopia’s aggressively pro-EV policies. In 2024, the country became the first in the world to ban the import of non-electric private vehicles.

The case is largely an economic one: Gasoline is expensive there, and the country commissioned Africa’s largest hydropower dam in September 2025, providing a new source of cheap and abundant clean electricity. The nearly $5 billion project has a five-gigawatt capacity, doubling the grid’s peak power in the country.

Much of Ethiopia’s vehicle market is for used cars, and some drivers are still opting for older gas-powered vehicles. But this nudge could help increase the market for EVs there.

Other African countries are also pushing some drivers toward electrification. Rwanda banned new registrations for commercial gas-powered motorbikes in the capital city of Kigali last year, encouraging EVs as an alternative. These motorbike taxis can make up over half the vehicles on the city’s streets, so the move is a major turning point for transportation there.

Smaller two- and three-wheelers are a bright spot for EVs globally: In 2025, EVs made up about 45% of new sales for such vehicles. (For cars and trucks, the share was about 25%.)

And Africa’s local market is starting to really take off. There’s already some local assembly of electric two-wheelers in countries including Morocco, Kenya, and Rwanda, says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Spiro, a Dubai-based electric motorbike company, recently raised $100 million in funding to expand operations in Africa. The company currently assembles its bikes in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda, and as of October it has over 60,000 bikes deployed and 1,500 battery swap stations operating.

Assembly and manufacturing for larger EVs and batteries is also set to expand. Gotion High-Tech, a Chinese battery company, is currently building Africa’s first battery gigafactory. It’s a $5.6 billion project that could produce 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually, starting in 2026. (That’s enough for hundreds of thousands of EVs each year.)

Chinese EV companies are looking to growing markets like Southeast Asia and Africa as they attempt to expand beyond an oversaturated domestic scene. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is aggressively expanding across South Africa and plans to have as many as 70 dealerships in the country by the end of this year. That will mean more options for people in Africa looking to buy electric.

“You have very high-quality, very affordable vehicles coming onto the market that are benefiting from the economies of scale in China. These countries stand to benefit from that,” says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank. “It’s a game changer,” he adds.

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.

Just last week the Chinese firm Moonshot AI released its latest open-weight model, Kimi K2.5, which came close to top proprietary systems such as Anthropic’s Claude Opus on some early benchmarks. The difference: K2.5 is roughly one-seventh Opus’s price.

On Hugging Face, Alibaba’s Qwen family—after ranking as the most downloaded model series in 2025 and 2026—has overtaken Meta’s Llama models in cumulative downloads. And a recent MIT study found that Chinese open-source models have surpassed US models in total downloads. For developers and builders worldwide, access to near-frontier AI capabilities has never been this broad or this affordable.

But these models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If these open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards.

When DeepSeek launched R1, much of the initial shock centered on its origin. Suddenly, a Chinese team had released a reasoning model that could stand alongside the best systems from US labs. But the long tail of DeepSeek’s impact had less to do with nationality than with distribution. R1 was released as an open-weight model under a permissive MIT license, allowing anyone to download, inspect, and deploy it. On top of that, DeepSeek also published a paper detailing its training process and techniques. For developers who access models via an API, DeepSeek also undercut competitors on price, offering access at a fraction the cost of OpenAI’s o1, the leading proprietary reasoning model at the time.

Within days of its release, DeepSeek replaced ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the US App Store. The moment spilled beyond developer circles into financial markets, triggering a sharp sell-off in US tech stocks that briefly erased roughly $1 trillion in market value. Almost overnight, DeepSeek went from a little-known spin-off team backed by a quantitative hedge fund to the most visible symbol of China’s push for open-source AI.

China’s decision to lean in to open source isn’t surprising. It has the world’s second-largest concentration of AI talent after the US. plus a vast, well-resourced tech industry. After ChatGPT broke into the mainstream, China’s AI sector went through a reckoning—and emerged determined to catch up. Pursuing an open-source strategy was seen as the fastest way to close the gap by rallying developers, spreading adoption, and setting standards.

DeepSeek’s success injected confidence into an industry long used to following global standards rather than setting them. “Thirty years ago, no Chinese person would believe they could be at the center of global innovation,” says Alex Chenglin Wu, CEO and founder of Atoms, an AI agent company and prominent contributor to China’s open-source ecosystem. “DeepSeek shows that with solid technical talent, a supportive environment, and the right organizational culture, it’s possible to do truly world-class work.”

DeepSeek’s breakout moment wasn’t China’s first open-source success. Alibaba’s Qwen Lab had been releasing open-weight models for years. By September 2024,  well before DeepSeek’s V3 launch, Alibaba was saying that global downloads had exceeded 600 million. On Hugging Face, Qwen accounted for more than 30% of all model downloads in 2024. Other institutions, including the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and the AI firm Baichuan, were also releasing open models as early as 2023.

But since the success of DeepSeek, the field has widened rapidly. Companies such as Z.ai (formerly Zhipu), MiniMax, Tencent, and a growing number of smaller labs have released models that are competitive on reasoning, coding, and agent-style tasks. The growing number of capable models has sped up progress. Capabilities that once took months to make it to the open-source world now emerge within weeks, even days.

“Chinese AI firms have seen real gains from the open-source playbook,” says Liu Zhiyuan, a professor of computer science at Tsinghua University and chief scientist at the AI startup ModelBest. “By releasing strong research, they build reputation and gain free publicity.”

Beyond commercial incentives, Liu says, open source has taken on cultural and strategic weight. “In the Chinese programmer community, open source has become politically correct,” he says, framing it as a response to US dominance in proprietary AI systems.

That shift is also reflected at the institutional level. Universities including Tsinghua have begun encouraging AI development and open-source contributions, while policymakers have moved to formalize those incentives. In August, China’s State Council released a draft policy encouraging universities to reward open-source work, proposing that students’ contributions on platforms such as GitHub or Gitee could eventually be counted toward academic credit.

With growing momentum and a reinforcing feedback loop, China’s push for open-source models is likely to continue in the near term, though its long-term sustainability still hinges on financial results, says Tiezhen Wang, who helps lead work on global AI at Hugging Face. In January, the model labs Z.ai and MiniMax went public in Hong Kong. “Right now, the focus is on making the cake bigger,” says Wang. “The next challenge is figuring out how each company secures its share.”

Chinese open-source models are leading not just in download volume but also in variety. Alibaba’s Qwen has become one of the most diversified open model families in circulation, offering a wide range of variants optimized for different uses. The lineup ranges from lightweight models that can run on a single laptop to large, multi-hundred-billion-parameter systems designed for data-center deployment. Qwen features many task-optimized variants created by the community: the “instruct” models are good at following orders, and “code” variants specialize in coding.

Although this strategy isn’t unique to Chinese labs, Qwen was the first open model family to roll out so many high-quality options that it started to feel like a full product line—one that’s free to use.

The open-weight nature of these releases also makes it easy for others to adapt them through techniques like fine-tuning and distillation, which means training a smaller model to mimic a larger one.  According to ATOM (American Truly Open Models), a project by the AI researcher Nathan Lambert, by August 4, 2025, model variations derived from Qwen were “more than 40%” of new Hugging Face language-model derivatives, while Llama had fallen to about 15%. This means that Qwen has become the default base model for all the “remixes.”

This pattern has made the case for smaller, more specialized models. “Compute and energy are real constraints for any deployment,” Liu says. He told MIT Technology Review that the rise of small models is about making AI cheaper to run and easier for more people to use. His company, ModelBest, focuses on small language models designed to run locally on devices such as phones, cars, and other consumer hardware.

While an average user might interact with AI only through the web or an app for simple conversations, power users of AI models with some technical background are experimenting with giving AI more autonomy to solve large-scale problems. OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent that recently went viral within the AI hacker world, allows AI to take over your computer—it can run 24-7, going through your emails and work tasks without supervision.

OpenClaw, like many other open-source tools, allows users to connect to different AI models via an application programming interface, or API. Within days of OpenClaw’s release, the team revealed that Kimi’s K2.5 had surpassed Claude Opus and became the most used AI model—by token count, meaning it was handling more total text processed across user prompts and model responses.

Cost has been a major reason Chinese models have gained traction, but it would be a mistake to treat them as mere “dupes” of Western frontier systems, Wang suggests. Like any product, a model only needs to be good enough for the job at hand.

The landscape of open-source models in China is also getting more specialized. Research groups such as Shanghai AI Laboratory have released models geared toward scientific and technical tasks; several projects from Tencent have focused specifically on music generation. Ubiquant, a quantitative finance firm like DeepSeek’s parent High-Flyer, has released an open model aimed at medical reasoning.

In the meantime, innovative architectural ideas from Chinese labs are being picked up more broadly. DeepSeek has published work exploring model efficiency and memory; techniques that compress the model’s attention “cache,” reducing memory and inference costs while mostly preserving performance, have drawn significant attention in the research community.

“The impact of these research breakthroughs is amplified because they’re open-sourced and can be picked up quickly across the field,” says Wang.

The adoption of Chinese models is picking up in Silicon Valley, too. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has put a number on it: Among startups pitching with open-source stacks, there’s about an 80% chance they’re running on Chinese open models, according to a post he made on X. Usage data tells a similar story. OpenRouter,  a middleman that tracks how people use different AI models through its API, shows Chinese open models rising from almost none in late 2024 to nearly 30% of usage in some recent weeks.

The demand is also rising globally. Z.ai limited new subscriptions to its GLM coding plan (a coding tool based on its flagship GLM models) after demand surged, citing compute constraints. What’s notable is where the demand is coming from: CNBC reports that the system’s user base is primarily concentrated in the United States and China, followed by India, Japan, Brazil, and the UK.

“The open-source ecosystems in China and the US are tightly bound together,” says Wang at Hugging Face. Many Chinese open models still rely on Nvidia and US cloud platforms to train and serve them, which keeps the business ties tangled. Talent is fluid too: Researchers move across borders and companies, and many still operate as a global community, sharing code and ideas in public.

That interdependence is part of what makes Chinese developers feel optimistic about this moment: The work travels, gets remixed, and actually shows up in products. But openness can also accelerate the competition. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, made a version of this point after DeepSeek’s 2025 releases: He wrote that export controls are “not a way to duck the competition” between the US and China, and that AI companies in the US “must have better models” if they want to prevail.

For the past decade, the story of Chinese tech in the West has been one of big expectations that ran into scrutiny, restrictions, and political backlash. This time the export isn’t just an app or a consumer platform. It’s the underlying model layer that other people build on. Whether that will play out differently is still an open question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

That might explain why the first breakthrough LLM personal assistant came not from one of the major AI labs, which have to worry about reputation and liability, but from an independent software engineer, Peter Steinberger. In November of 2025, Steinberger uploaded his tool, now called OpenClaw, to GitHub, and in late January the project went viral.

OpenClaw harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out. The risks posed by OpenClaw are so extensive that it would probably take someone the better part of a week to read all of the security blog posts on it that have cropped up in the past few weeks. The Chinese government took the step of issuing a public warning about OpenClaw’s security vulnerabilities.

In response to these concerns, Steinberger posted on X that nontechnical people should not use the software. (He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and it’s not limited to people who can run their own software security audits. Any AI companies that hope to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research.

OpenClaw is, in essence, a mecha suit for LLMs. Users can choose any LLM they like to act as the pilot; that LLM then gains access to improved memory capabilities and the ability to set itself tasks that it repeats on a regular cadence. Unlike the agentic offerings from the major AI companies, OpenClaw agents are meant to be on 24-7, and users can communicate with them using WhatsApp or other messaging apps. That means they can act like a superpowered personal assistant who wakes you each morning with a personalized to-do list, plans vacations while you work, and spins up new apps in its spare time.

But all that power has consequences. If you want your AI personal assistant to manage your inbox, then you need to give it access to your email—and all the sensitive information contained there. If you want it to make purchases on your behalf, you need to give it your credit card info. And if you want it to do tasks on your computer, such as writing code, it needs some access to your local files.

There are a few ways this can go wrong. The first is that the AI assistant might make a mistake, as when a user’s Google Antigravity coding agent reportedly wiped his entire hard drive. The second is that someone might gain access to the agent using conventional hacking tools and use it to either extract sensitive data or run malicious code. In the weeks since OpenClaw went viral, security researchers have demonstrated numerous such vulnerabilities that put security-naïve users at risk.

Both of these dangers can be managed: Some users are choosing to run their OpenClaw agents on separate computers or in the cloud, which protects data on their hard drives from being erased, and other vulnerabilities could be fixed using tried-and-true security approaches.

But the experts I spoke to for this article were focused on a much more insidious security risk known as prompt injection. Prompt injection is effectively LLM hijacking: Simply by posting malicious text or images on a website that an LLM might peruse, or sending them to an inbox that an LLM reads, attackers can bend it to their will.

And if that LLM has access to any of its user’s private information, the consequences could be dire. “Using something like OpenClaw is like giving your wallet to a stranger in the street,” says Nicolas Papernot, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto. Whether or not the major AI companies can feel comfortable offering personal assistants may come down to the quality of the defenses that they can muster against such attacks.

It’s important to note here that prompt injection has not yet caused any catastrophes, or at least none that have been publicly reported. But now that there are likely hundreds of thousands of OpenClaw agents buzzing around the internet, prompt injection might start to look like a much more appealing strategy for cybercriminals. “Tools like this are incentivizing malicious actors to attack a much broader population,” Papernot says.

The term “prompt injection” was coined by the popular LLM blogger Simon Willison in 2022, a couple of months before ChatGPT was released. Even back then, it was possible to discern that LLMs would introduce a completely new type of security vulnerability once they came into widespread use. LLMs can’t tell apart the instructions that they receive from users and the data that they use to carry out those instructions, such as emails and web search results—to an LLM, they’re all just text. So if an attacker embeds a few sentences in an email and the LLM mistakes them for an instruction from its user, the attacker can get the LLM to do anything it wants.

Prompt injection is a tough problem, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. “We don’t really have a silver-bullet defense right now,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. But there’s a robust academic community working on the problem, and they’ve come up with strategies that could eventually make AI personal assistants safe.

Technically speaking, it is possible to use OpenClaw today without risking prompt injection: Just don’t connect it to the internet. But restricting OpenClaw from reading your emails, managing your calendar, and doing online research defeats much of the purpose of using an AI assistant. The trick of protecting against prompt injection is to prevent the LLM from responding to hijacking attempts while still giving it room to do its job.

One strategy is to train the LLM to ignore prompt injections. A major part of the LLM development process, called post-training, involves taking a model that knows how to produce realistic text and turning it into a useful assistant by “rewarding” it for answering questions appropriately and “punishing” it when it fails to do so. These rewards and punishments are metaphorical, but the LLM learns from them as an animal would. Using this process, it’s possible to train an LLM not to respond to specific examples of prompt injection.

But there’s a balance: Train an LLM to reject injected commands too enthusiastically, and it might also start to reject legitimate requests from the user. And because there’s a fundamental element of randomness in LLM behavior, even an LLM that has been very effectively trained to resist prompt injection will likely still slip up every once in a while.

Another approach involves halting the prompt injection attack before it ever reaches the LLM. Typically, this involves using a specialized detector LLM to determine whether or not the data being sent to the original LLM contains any prompt injections. In a recent study, however, even the best-performing detector completely failed to pick up on certain categories of prompt injection attack.

The third strategy is more complicated. Rather than controlling the inputs to an LLM by detecting whether or not they contain a prompt injection, the goal is to formulate a policy that guides the LLM’s outputs—i.e., its behaviors—and prevents it from doing anything harmful. Some defenses in this vein are quite simple: If an LLM is allowed to email only a few pre-approved addresses, for example, then it definitely won’t send its user’s credit card information to an attacker. But such a policy would prevent the LLM from completing many useful tasks, such as researching and reaching out to potential professional contacts on behalf of its user.

“The challenge is how to accurately define those policies,” says Neil Gong, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. “It’s a trade-off between utility and security.”

On a larger scale, the entire agentic world is wrestling with that trade-off: At what point will agents be secure enough to be useful? Experts disagree. Song, whose startup, Virtue AI, makes an agent security platform, says she thinks it’s possible to safely deploy an AI personal assistant now. But Gong says, “We’re not there yet.”

Even if AI agents can’t yet be entirely protected against prompt injection, there are certainly ways to mitigate the risks. And it’s possible that some of those techniques could be implemented in OpenClaw. Last week, at the inaugural ClawCon event in San Francisco, Steinberger announced that he’d brought a security person on board to work on the tool.

As of now, OpenClaw remains vulnerable, though that hasn’t dissuaded its multitude of enthusiastic users. George Pickett, a volunteer maintainer of the OpenGlaw GitHub repository and a fan of the tool, says he’s taken some security measures to keep himself safe while using it: He runs it in the cloud, so that he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally deleting his hard drive, and he’s put mechanisms in place to ensure that no one else can connect to his assistant.

But he hasn’t taken any specific actions to prevent prompt injection. He’s aware of the risk but says he hasn’t yet seen any reports of it happening with OpenClaw. “Maybe my perspective is a stupid way to look at it, but it’s unlikely that I’ll be the first one to be hacked,” he says.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How next-generation nuclear reactors break out of the 20th-century blueprint

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste.The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

“These companies are terrified that no one’s going to notice them.”

—Tom Goodwin, co-founder of business consulting firm All We Have Is Now, tells the Guardian why AI startups are going to increasingly desperate measures to grab would-be customers’ attention.

How AI is changing gymnastics judgingThe 2023 World Championships last October marked the first time an AI judging system was used on every apparatus in a gymnastics competition. There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics. The question now is whether it really makes it fairer. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, M&A advisors such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

L40 is an M&A advisory firm specializing in tech deals that work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <h2>Naboo raises $70M to turn AI event planning into corporate procurement platform</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/naboo-raises-70m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.
