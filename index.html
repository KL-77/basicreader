            <h2>Report: Imminent Apple hardware updates include MacBook Pro, iPads, and iPhone 17e</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/report-imminent-apple-hardware-updates-include-macbook-pro-ipads-and-iphone-17e/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s 2026 has already brought us the AirTag 2 and a new Creator Studio app subscription aimed at independent content creators, but nothing so far for the company’s main product families.

That could change soon, according to reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. New versions of Apple’s low-end iPhone, the basic iPad and iPad Air, and the higher-end MacBook Pros are said to be coming “imminently,” “soon,” and “shortly,” respectively, ahead of planned updates later in the year for the iPad mini, Studio Display, and other Mac models.

Here’s what we think we know about the hardware that’s coming.

Apple is apparently planning to launch an updated iPhone 17e, a new version of its basic iPhone. The phone is said to include an A19 chip similar to the one in the regular iPhone 17, and it will also add MagSafe charging. Though the iPhone 17e will likely stick to the basic one-lens camera system and the notched, Dynamic Island-less screen, it will also launch at the same $599 price as the current 16e, which counts as good news given current AI-driven RAM and storage shortages.

This would be a change in how Apple approaches its lower-end iPhone. The old iPhone SE was updated pretty sporadically, with at least a couple of years between each of its updates. The iPhone 16e was introduced just last year.

The biggest question is whether the 17e will continue to exist alongside the older but arguably superior iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which start at just $100 more than the current iPhone 16e and include a dual-lens camera system and the Dynamic Island. Having four different iPhone models available in the same $600-to-$800 price range is confusing at best.

This one’s easy: The M4 Pro and M4 Max versions of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros will be replaced by M5 Pro and M5 Max versions.

We’ve been expecting new MacBook Pros for a while now, ever since the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro launched in the fall without higher-end M5 Pro and M5 Max models. Shipping estimates for the current M4 Pro- and M4 Max-based MacBook Pros have been lengthening lately, which is sometimes a sign that manufacturing is winding down ahead of a new model.

Though larger updates to the MacBook Pro are said to be in development at Apple, including models with OLED display panels and possibly touchscreens, the M5 versions will largely stick to the same designs Apple has been using since it introduced the M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pros in late 2021.

Gurman says new Mac Studio models are also in the works, as are Mac minis, an update for the Studio Display, and the long-rumored “low-cost MacBook” that Apple is said to be planning to fill a gap in its laptop lineup. Apple has sold the old M1 MacBook Air through Walmart in the US for as low as $599 in recent years, an experiment that has apparently convinced the company that there’s room in its laptop lineup for a computer that comes in well below the $999 baseline it has used for most of its laptops over the last two decades.

Apple’s next iPad upgrades will also apparently be of the “change the processor and not much else” variety. But this will still be a relatively big deal for the basic $349 iPad, which Gurman says is stepping away from the current Apple A16 chip to an Apple A18, first seen in the iPhone 16 series in late 2024.

We can’t say for sure how much faster the A18 will be than the A16—Apple sometimes uses versions of its chips with extra CPU or GPU cores disabled for the low-end iPad—but the chip will still add Apple Intelligence support to the low-end iPad for the first time. The A16 iPad stood out among Apple’s 2025 hardware releases as one of the few that did not support Apple Intelligence. If the A18 iPad supports it, that also suggests that the iPad will come with 8GB of RAM for the first time, which will be useful for multitaskers even if you don’t care about the current slate of Apple Intelligence features or the pending “more intelligent Siri.”

The report also says Apple is preparing an iPad Air update that uses an M4 processor instead of the current M3. The M4 iPad Pro launched nearly two years ago (alongside an M2-based iPad Air), so an M4 iPad Air will hardly break any speed records. But a new chip will keep the tablet feeling reasonably fresh while we wait for a version with an updated design or a better screen.

Gurman says the iPad mini will also get an update at some point this year—among other improvements, it will allegedly switch to an OLED display panel. But it sounds like Apple is planning to launch it later in the year, sometime after the A18 iPad and the M4 iPad Air.</div>

            <h2>Why would Elon Musk pivot from Mars to the Moon all of a sudden?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As more than 120 million people tuned in to the Super Bowl for kickoff on Sunday evening, SpaceX founder Elon Musk turned instead to his social network. There, he tapped out an extended message in which he revealed that SpaceX is pivoting from the settlement of Mars to building a “self-growing” city on the Moon.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk wrote, in part.

This is simultaneously a jolting and practical decision coming from Musk.

A quarter of a century ago, Musk founded SpaceX with a single-minded goal: settling Mars. One of his longest-tenured employees, SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell, described her very first interview with Musk in 2002 to me as borderline messianic.

“He was talking about Mars, his Mars Oasis project,” Shotwell said. “He wanted to do Mars Oasis, because he wanted people to see that life on Mars was doable, and we needed to go there.”

She was not alone in this description of her first interaction with Musk. The vision for SpaceX has not wavered. Even in the company’s newest, massive Starship rocket factory at the Starbase facility in South Texas—also known as the Gateway to Mars—there are reminders of the red planet everywhere. For example, the carpet inside Musk’s executive conference room is rust red, the same color as the surface of Mars.

In the last 25 years Musk has gone from an obscure, modestly wealthy person to the richest human being ever, from a political moderate to chief supporter of Donald Trump; from a respected entrepreneur to, well, to a lot of things to a lot of people: world’s greatest industrialist/super villain/savant/grifter-fraudster.

But one thing that has remained constant across the Muskiverse has been his commitment to “extending the light of human consciousness” and to the belief that the best place to begin humanity’s journey toward becoming a multi-planetary species was Mars.

We cannot know Musk’s full rationale for pivoting to the Moon, at least in the near term. Only a year ago he referred to the Moon as a “distraction.” But now, apparently, it’s not. What we can do is look at what has changed in the last 13 months.

The first change is that the one company with the potential to seriously challenge SpaceX in spaceflight over the next decade, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, has finally started to deliver. The company has now flown, and landed, its New Glenn rocket. Multiple sources have told Ars that Bezos has told his team to go “all in” on lunar exploration. This includes development of a crew transportation system, Blue Moon Mark 1.5, that does not require orbital refueling. This raises the possibility that Blue Origin might land humans on the Moon before Starship, a threat sources at Starbase say SpaceX is beginning to take seriously.

The other major change is Musk’s obsession with artificial intelligence and his view that AI and space are increasingly intertwined in their ambitions. SpaceX and xAI recently merged, and a major focus of Musk going forward will be to construct orbital data centers to provide enormous computing resources for his vision of humanity’s online future.

He has also spoken increasingly of becoming a Kardashev-level civilization, a reference to a Soviet astronomer who conceived that humanity would advance by first being able to tap and store all energy sources available on its planet, and then by directly collecting a star’s energy through technology like a Dyson sphere. Musk has also made frequent references on social media to building a “mass driver” on the Moon.

All of this may sound like it’s straight out of the pages of a science fiction novel, and it pretty much is. But the reality is that the Moon has reliable stores of oxygen and silicon, and building a catapult-like mechanism on the airless world would be an efficient way to move materials into space to build large orbital factories, data centers, solar farms, or even O’Neill cylinders.

In this, Musk is starting to sound a lot more like Bezos when it comes to his vision for human habitation in space, rather than the Mars-first advocate he has always been.

One other sobering thing to think about in terms of a lunar mass-driver: it is potentially an extremely potent weapon to threaten Earth with large projectiles. We cannot know if Musk has had any conversations with US military officials about this, but anyone who has read The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein will understand Luna’s position as the ultimate high ground. And the US Space Force is not ignorant of this.

In the short-term, it does not mean a whole lot. To anyone paying attention, SpaceX was not on track to send a Starship to Mars in 2026, and the 2028 window was looking rather unlikely as well. Mars was always in the distance, and now it will remain so.

By focusing on the Moon, Musk is making a decision that benefits NASA and the United States. Because for all of Blue Origin’s promise with a slimmed down lunar lander, Starship offers a promising avenue to return humans to the Moon in the near term.

Another advantage of Starship is its enormous payload capacity, able to bring 100 metric tons, or more, of cargo down to the Moon. For anyone seeking to build a commercial business on the Moon, Musk’s 180-degree pivot represents an enormous opportunity.

For Mars advocates, however, Musk’s turn is a bitter pill to swallow. There have long been many dreamers who spoke of settling Mars, but only Musk actually built the hardware and financial war chest to make such dreams a reality. And it is true that, in the long-term, Mars offers a more favorable (although still inhospitable) environment for human settlement, with a thin atmosphere, water ice both on the surface and beneath the ground, methane, and more.

But those dreams are now deferred as Musk has bowed to a harsh reality: The Moon may be hard, but it is a lot easier to develop than Mars, which is only accessible every 26 months when the planets align.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Sure, most Americans are glued to their TVs for today’s Super Bowl and/or the Winter Olympics. But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space.

As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise:

Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone.

In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky.

To say there’s a lot of interest in this movie might be an understatement. The first trailer was released in June and racked up a whopping 400 million views worldwide in its first week. The footage—which included Ryland discovering an alien ship inhabited by the aforementioned Rocky—gave every indication of following Weir’s novel pretty closely. That’s very good news for Weir fans, which includes several of us here at Ars.

That earlier trailer mostly gave us a lot of backstory about how Ryland ended up reluctantly agreeing to the mission, with just a few glimpses of Rocky. But Rocky is front and center for this latest one. The footage focuses on how Ryland and Rocky learn to communicate and gradually bond over their shared fates, with strains of Prince’s “I Would Die For You” echoing in the background. It starts with Rocky imitating Ryland’s body motions, including a goofy hero pose. Eventually Ryland figures out how to synthesize a voice for Rocky so they can better coordinate their strategies. Will they succeed? Or is this a one-way trip for one or both of them?

Project Hail Mary hits theaters on March 20, 2026.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/under-trump-epas-enforcement-of-environmental-laws-collapses-report-finds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group.

By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.

Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.

“Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.

The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump.

From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air, and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration.

At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in US history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment.

Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.

Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures.

“Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a December 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices.

Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote.

Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode.

Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators.

One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action.

“But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.”

Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021.

The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report.

However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email.

Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads.

Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report.

“We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.”

The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters.

Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added.

“Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a push toward AI agents, with both Anthropic and OpenAI shipping multi-agent tools this week, Anthropic is more than ready to show off some of its more daring AI coding experiments. But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead.

On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.

Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.

Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own.

The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom.

It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place.

The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less-efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.”

Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it.

And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models.

Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one.

On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter.

The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible.

And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail.

He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files.

He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.

“Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.”

None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools.

Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.

Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban.

Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections.

Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.”

On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”

Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.”

But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation.

While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses.

As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching.

For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells.

A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses.

What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway.

In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide the desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own.

However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible.

While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea.

The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop.

While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him.

Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Artificial intelligence has taken the medical device industry by storm — even adding a layer of complexity to the operating room that’s resulting in patients being hurt, some health professionals claim.

As Reuters reports, the TruDi Navigation System by device maker Acclarent was designed to treat chronic sinusitis, inflammation of the nasal sinuses, by inserting a tiny balloon to enlarge the sinus cavity openings.

But ever since the company added AI to the device, the US Food and Drug Administration has received at least unconfirmed 100 reports of malfunctions and adverse events, including at least ten instances of patients being injured.

While it’s still unclear what role AI played in these instances, the resulting injuries can be grim, from the punctured base of a patient’s skull to cerebrospinal fluid leaking from one another’s nose, per the reports.

Two victims who say they’ve experienced strokes following their sinuplasties involving the TruDi Navigation System have since sued the device’s maker, Acclarent, which has since been acquired by Integra LifeSciences. The plaintiff in one of the cases, Erin Ralph, accused the company of having the device mislead surgeon Marc Dean during a 2022 procedure, causing him to injure a carotid artery, leading to a blood clot and eventually a stroke.

The AI is used in the TruDi Navigation System to confirm the position of the devices inside the patient’s head.

“The product was arguably safer before integrating changes in the software to incorporate artificial intelligence than after the software modifications were implemented,” one of these suits alleges, as quoted by Reuters.

The second lawsuit was filed by Donna Fernihough, whose carotid artery allegedly “blew,” causing blood to spray “all over,” and resulting in her experiencing a stroke the same day.

Acclarent “knew or should have known that the purported artificial intelligence caused or exacerbated the tendency of the integrated navigation system product to be inconsistent, inaccurate, and unreliable,” Fernihough’s case alleges.

The suit also accused Acclarent of lowering “its safety standards to rush the new technology to market” and setting “as a goal only 80 percent accuracy for some of this new technology before integrating it into the TruDi Navigation System.”

Integra LifeSciences pushed back, telling Reuters that “there is no credible evidence to show any causal connection between the TruDi Navigation System, AI technology, and any alleged injuries.” Acclarent denied allegations in both suits, which are still ongoing.

Nonetheless, these instances illustrate how the operating room is quickly being overtaken by AI, a trend that started long before the advent of large language models (LLMs) like the ones powering ChatGPT. For instance, machine-learning algorithms have been used to screen for diseases like cancer in medical scans for decades.

We’ve already seen reports of AI-powered medical instruments falling victim to the known shortcomings of the tech. For instance, a recent study found that two-thirds of more than 12,000 patients identified as having heart failure by an AI-enhanced stethoscope didn’t actually have heart failure.

We’ve also seen LLM-based chatbots designed to give medical advice to real-world patients experience widespread hallucinations. Experts also warn that doctors are losing the ability to identify cancer in scans due to the reliance on AI-powered detectors.

Whether regulatory oversight is there to ensure patients don’t get hurt by AI medical devices remains a subject of heated debate. Devices using AI don’t even have to be used in clinical trials before being approved by the FDA. Instead, many device makers point to previously authorized devices before adding AI to them, according to Reuters.

Worse yet, the Trump administration’s enormous cuts to the FDA’s budget have led to dozens of AI scientists being laid off or encouraged to leave, adding plenty of pressure to those who remain.

“If you don’t have the resources, things are more likely to be missed,” a former device reviewer told Reuters.

Meanwhile, the FDA has doubled down on the tech, outsourcing oversight duties to LLMs to “fuel innovation” and accelerate drug approvals.

Most recently, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Mehmet “Doctor Oz” Oz gloated over “robots” that can do anything from performing ultrasounds on pregnant women and “wands” that can determine “whether the child’s OK or not.”

“And frankly, I don’t have to see the image,” he said. “I just have to know if the image is good enough to tell me the child doesn’t have a problem.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.

According to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.

“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”

Five hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.

“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.

The subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.

“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.

As DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.

“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”

When uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.

When Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”

“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”

Credit where it’s due, though: Google delayed handing over Jon’s data long enough for the ACLU to challenge the subpoena on his behalf, though it didn’t explain why. Of course, that meant DHS agents still tracked down his address some other way — part of a growing trend of federal agencies surveilling and harassing random people who haven’t even been arrested, let alone convicted of a crime.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Health professionals have long had to deal with patients who inadvisably shoved a whole range of foreign objects up their behinds, often requiring medical intervention to retrieve them.

It’s a surprisingly common issue. According to a 2023 study, there are around 4,000 cases a year of both male and female individuals visiting emergency departments for what the researchers euphemistically termed “rectal foreign bodies.”

Now, in a twist to the age-old story that even the writing room of “Grey’s Anatomy” couldn’t have come up with, a man in France was rushed to the operating room after staffers at the Rangueil Hospital in Toulouse found out he had shoved a 37mm brass-and-copper “collectible shell” that was used by the Imperial German Army during World War 1 up his rectum.

As Agence France-Presse reports, officials had to call in a bomb disposal team and evacuate the hospital after the man was admitted over the weekend. Firefighters were called in as well to “ensure fire protection during the bomb disposal team’s intervention.”

Fortunately, emergency teams later confirmed that the “explosive device has been neutralized,” ending the unusual incident.

The unnamed man is 24 years old and could be facing legal action for handling “category A munitions,” an officer told the Daily Mail.

Beyond being found inside people’s rectums, around 1.5 billion shells were fired during World War 1, according to the Military Times. The ordnances are still being collected to this day.

Amazingly, it’s somehow not the first time a Frenchman has been rushed to the hospital after shoving a shell up his behind. In late 2022, an 88-year-old stuck a World War 1 artillery shell in his rectum; surgeons at a hospital in Toulon, France, were forced to make an incision in his abdomen to retrieve the ancient relic.

The discovery was understandably a major surprise at the time.

“An apple, a mango, or even a can of shaving foam, we are used to finding unusual objects inserted where they shouldn’t be,” one ER doctor told French newspaper Var-Matin. “But a shell? Never!”

In an even more potentially dangerous ploy, a man in England managed to lodge a two-inch wide World War 2 anti-tank shell where the Sun don’t shine, forcing a hospital in Gloucester to also call in a bomb disposal team.

The man told officials at the time that he allegedly “slipped and fell” on the ordnance.

            <div id="article-text">Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs have become an enormously popular way to lose weight. And with generic, much cheaper versions of the medications on the horizon, their use could soon grow even further.

But apart from being a clinically proven way to shed pounds — at least temporarily — along with a whole constellation of other health benefits, the drugs also turn out to be a major strain on the environment.

As detailed in a new paper published in the journal Nature Sustainability, researchers from the University of Melbourne investigated how the process of producing peptides — short chains of amino acids that aren’t just used for GLP-1 agonists, but plenty of other drugs and treatments as well — releases huge amounts of organic solvents and other plastic byproducts that don’t break down on their own in nature.

Fortunately, the researchers say they’ve come up with a much more environmentally friendly procedure that could make producing peptide-based treatments far more sustainable in the long-run.

So far, they’ve been manufactured using a technique called “solid phase peptide synthesis,” or SPPS, which anchors the first amino acid building block to a synthetic resin, such as polystyrene beads. Toxic solvents — including dimethylformamide, a component of paint strippers — are then used to add each amino acid one by one, which can then leak into the water supply.

The scale of the issue is considerable. As the lead author of the Nature Sustainability paper and University of Melbourne chemistry professor John Wade wrote in a piece about his research, the annual production of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight loss drugs such as Ozempic, is currently generating upwards of 123 million pounds of toxic solvent waste. And that’s just one of more than 80 peptide-based drugs on the market.

The materials involved are also expensive and difficult to get rid of, thanks to tight environmental regulations.

“Why are we still making life-saving medicines using chemical processes that produce mountains of toxic waste, and could water — the cleanest and most familiar solvent of all — offer a way out?” Wade asked rhetorically.

In response, the researcher and his colleagues came up with a water-based solution to synthesize peptides. By pairing amino acids with specific salts, they found they could overcome limitations associated with SPPS, allowing them to dissolve them in water “at high concentrations while remaining fully functional.”

An activating agent combined with a biodegradable material could allow for “efficient peptide synthesis entirely in water,” the professor argued.

It remains to be seen whether the process can be scaled up industrially, but given the wide proliferation of GLP-1 agonists, it’s critical to investigate ways of making manufacturing processes more sustainable.

“What began as a shared concern among three long-time international collaborators has become an exciting technology with the potential to reshape how some of the most important medicines of our time are made,” Wade wrote. “Cleanly, responsibly and ready for the future.”

            <h2>Jeffrey Epstein Had a Bizarre Obsession With “Improving” Human DNA, and He Was Emailing With Top Scientists About It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jeffrey Epstein had a bizarre obsession with genetics and “improving” human DNA — and he was corresponding with top scientists to make his fantasies a reality.

The newly released documents from the Justice Department shine additional light on how the convicted child sex criminal exhibited a fascination with transhumanism, a controversial movement in science and philosophy with a eugenicist mission: using cutting edge technology, including genetic engineering and AI, to advance the biology of the human race. They also reinforce how serious Epstein was about pursuing these ideas, which he tossed around among his shockingly wide network of intellectuals, many of whom communicated with him long after he had pled guilty to child prostitution charges in 2008.

To ingratiate himself with top scientists, the deceased billionaire offered to fund their research and held expensive research conferences and parties. In 2006, he organized a conference on St Thomas in the British Virgin Islands — not far from his notorious “Epstein Island” — attended by luminaries including physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne. Even though the subject was supposed to be about the theory of gravity, the New York Times reported that one attendee recalled that all Epstein wanted to talk about was improving the human genome, and how the passing of certain traits might result in superior humans.

Epstein harbored myriad racist beliefs, including the idea that Black people’s genetics made them less intelligent. In 2016, Epstein emailed German cognitive scientist and then-MIT-professor Joscha Bach, indicating that he was interested in the idea of genetically modifying Black people to make them “smarter,” The Telegraph found. Bach had received a roughly $400,000 donation from Epstein. In a 2016 email exchange with leftist thinker Noam Chomsky, Epstein claimed that “the test score gap amongst African Americans is well documented,” and was adamant that a “set of genes used for working memory” could be “found and adjusted.”

Epstein also wanted to invest in research pursuing genetically modifying embryos to produce children with desirable traits, The Telegraph also spotted. He seriously entertained the idea in a 2018 email exchange — Subject: “Designer babies” — with crypto entrepreneur Bryan Bishop, who asked Epstein about securing funding. “i have no issue with investing,” Epstein responded.

As it happened, Epstein wanted children of his own — and lots of them. The 2019 NYT reporting details how Epstein had planned to “seed” the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his 33,000 square-foot ranch in New Mexico, and discussed the idea with multiple top scientists (who chose to remain anonymous). One of the scientists allegedly claimed that Epstein wanted to impregnate 20 women at a time.

Epstein also had a creepy obsession with using genetics to improve women’s sex drives. He repeatedly discussed the idea with former Stanford human biology professor Nathan Wolfe in email exchanges between 2008 and 2013, Stanford Daily found, in which they mused over the possibility of developing a “female viagra.”

Wolfe, perhaps even more so than Epstein, was serious about making it happen. In May 2013, he wrote to Epstein enthusing that their “horny virus hypothesis” could be correct. He claimed that he’d come up with a study “directly linking sexual behavior and microbial diversity,” and asked for Epstein’s thoughts about his “funding on this hypothesis.”

“I think it hits the sweet spot of what we’ve been thinking about (so to speak),” Wolfe added.

Another scientist that Epstein confided with was Martin Nowak, a math and biology professor at Harvard University. Nowak was known for his work on using mathematics to describe the evolution of the human language and how certain human behaviors emerged. In light of everything above, it’s not hard to see why Epstein took such a strong interest in his work: in 2003, the billionaire donated $30 million to Harvard to support Nowak’s research.

Nowak’s connection to Epstein is well documented. But the newly released documents additionally revealed an ominous sounding email to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s partner — and alleged partner in crime. “i am so very sorry i caused you so much worry and that i spoilt this day. i am so happy that i did not kill anybody,” he wrote in a 2002 email. “my perspective of life has changed somehow.” In 2014, Epstein sent a cryptic email to Nowak stating, “our spy was captured after completing her mission.” Nowak responded: “did you torture her.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plenty of asteroids can survive their fiery plunge through the Earth’s atmosphere. If they’re big enough, they can prove incredibly destructive, like the 60-foot Chelyabinsk meteor that exploded over the southern Ural region in Russia in 2013, releasing a blast equivalent to 30 times the energy of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.

And in case an even larger space rock were to ever threaten humanity, we’d have to get creative to keep it from colliding with our planet. Crashing a spacecraft into it like a pool ball to redirect its path — just like NASA did with its proof of concept Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission in 2022 — may not always be on the table, given the many uncertainties involved.

In a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications, an international team of researchers — including scientists from CERN and the University of Oxford — revisited the idea of blowing up an incoming asteroid with a nuclear warhead.

There are intuitive concerns. What if the asteroid shattered, turning a cosmic sniper shot into a shotgun blast of debris raining down over our planet?

But the team used CERN’s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to study how asteroid materials react to different levels of physical stress, including large-scale simulations of nuclear deflection, and found that the space rocks are surprisingly resilient.

“Planetary defense represents a scientific challenge,” said Karl-Georg Schlesinger, cofounder of nuclear deflection startup Outer Solar System Company (OuSoCo), which partnered with the scientists, in a statement. “The world must be able to execute a nuclear deflection mission with high confidence, yet cannot conduct a real-world test in advance.”

In an experiment, the team exposed samples of a metal-rich meteorite to 27 short but intense pulses of a proton beam at CERN’s HiRadMat facility. Afterward, the team moved the meteorite to the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK to analyze changes to its internal structure at a microscopic level.

To their surprise, the “material became stronger, exhibiting an increase in yield strength, and displayed a self-stabilizing damping behavior,” explained OuSoCo cofounder Melanie Bochmann.

The finding could have major implications for how we approach future asteroid redirection efforts.

“Our experiments indicate that — at least for metal-rich asteroid material — a larger device than previously thought can be used without catastrophically breaking the asteroid,” Bochmann said. “This keeps open an emergency option for situations involving very large objects or very short warning times, where non-nuclear methods are insufficient and where current models might assume fragmentation would limit the usable device size.”

Fortunately, the researchers could soon have far more data to go by. Both NASA and the European Space Agency are planning to study Apophis, an enormous asteroid somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 feet in width, which is expected to come eerily close to the Earth — closer than many geosynchronous satellites at just 20,000 miles — to Earth in April 2029.

“As a next step, we plan to study more complex and rocky asteroid materials,” the researchers said in a statement. “One example is a class of meteorites called pallasites, which consist of a metal matrix similar to the meteorite material we have already studied, with up to centimeter-sized magnesium-rich crystals embedded inside.”

The upcoming research could have fascinating implications outside of asteroid redirection as well.

“Because these objects are thought to originate from the core–mantle boundary of early planetesimals,” they added, “such experiments could also provide valuable insights into planetary formation processes.”

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic is in the final stages of raising $20 billion in new capital at a valuation of $350 billion, Bloomberg reports, with investor demand leading the company to raise twice the funding it set out to obtain. The company raised $13 billion in equity funding just five months ago, but intense competition between frontier labs and the ongoing cost of compute have made them eager to raise as quickly as possible.

Funds expected to participate in the round include Altimeter Capital Management, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Coatue Management, Iconiq Capital, and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, but the bulk of the funding is said to come from the company’s strategic partners Nvidia and Microsoft.

Anthropic is building on recent successes, most notably the deployment of its coding agents, which have software engineers raving about increased coding productivity. Last week, the company’s release of new models focused on legal and business research rattled the share prices of publicly-traded data firms as investors worried about the ability of AI to disrupt their businesses.

Anthropic’s rival, OpenAI, is reportedly assembling a new $100 billion fundraising round, and both companies are thought to be preparing IPOs ahead of a blockbuster summer in the markets, with xAI, recently acquired by SpaceX, also tapping public equity as part of the rocket maker’s IPO.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Businesses are generating more video than ever. From years of broadcast archives to thousands of store cameras and countless hours of production footage, most of it just sits unused on servers, unwatched and unanalyzed. This is dark data: a massive, untapped resource that companies collect automatically but almost never use in a meaningful way.

To tackle the problem, Aza Kai (CEO) and Hiraku Yanagita (COO), two former Googlers who spent nearly a decade working together at Google Japan, decided to build their own solution. The duo co-founded InfiniMind, a Tokyo-based startup developing infrastructure that converts petabytes of unviewed video and audio into structured, queryable business data.

“My co-founder, who spent a decade leading brand and data solutions at Google Japan, and I saw this inflection point coming while we were still at Google,” Kai said. By 2024, the technology had matured, and the market demand had become clear enough that the co-founders felt compelled to build the company themselves, he added.

Kai, who previously worked at Google Japan across cloud, machine learning, ad systems, and video recommendation models and later led data science teams, explained that current solutions force a tradeoff. Earlier approaches could label objects in individual frames, but they couldn’t track narratives, understand causality, or answer complex questions about video content. For clients with decades of broadcast archives and petabytes of footage, even basic questions about their content often went unanswered.

What really changed was the progress in vision-language models between 2021 and 2023. That’s when video AI started moving beyond simple object tagging, Kai noted. Falling GPU costs and annual performance gains of roughly 15–20% over the last decade helped, but the bigger story was capability until recently, models just couldn’t do the job, he told TechCrunch.

InfiniMind recently secured $5.8 million in seed funding, led by UTEC and joined by CX2, Headline Asia, Chiba Dojo, and an AI researcher at a16z Scout. The company is relocating its headquarters to the U.S., while it continues to operate an office in Japan. Japan provided the perfect testbed: strong hardware, talented engineers, and a supportive startup ecosystem, allowing the team to fine-tune its technology with demanding customers before going global.

Its first product, TV Pulse, launched in Japan in April 2025. The AI-powered platform analyzes television content in real time, helping media and retail companies “track product exposure, brand presence, customer sentiment, and PR impact,” per the startup. After pilot programs with major broadcasters and agencies, it already has paying customers, including wholesalers and media companies.

Now, InfiniMind is ready for the international market. Its flagship product, DeepFrame, a long-form video intelligence platform capable of processing 200 hours of footage to pinpoint specific scenes, speakers, or events, is scheduled for a beta release in March, followed by a full launch in April 2026, Kai said.

The video analysis space is highly fragmented. Companies such as TwelveLabs provide general-purpose video understanding APIs for a broad range of users, including consumers, prosumers, and enterprises, Kai said, while InfiniMind focuses specifically on enterprise use cases, including monitoring, safety, security, and analyzing video content for deeper insights.

“Our solution requires no code; clients bring their data, and our system processes it, providing actionable insights,” Kai said. “We also integrate audio, sound, and speech understanding, not just visuals. Our system can handle unlimited video length, and cost efficiency is a major differentiator. Most existing solutions prioritize accuracy or specific use cases but don’t solve cost challenges.”

The seed funding will help the team continue developing the DeepFrame model, expand engineering infrastructure, hire more engineers, and reach additional customers across Japan and the U.S.

“This is an exciting space, one of the paths toward AGI,” Kai said. “Understanding general video intelligence is about understanding reality. Industrial applications are important, but our ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of technology to better understand reality and help humans make better decisions.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After launching a “Home Safe” feature that lets users notify friends and family when they’ve arrived home safely, Snapchat is now introducing additional alerts to inform others when users have arrived at other destinations.

The social media giant announced on Monday that with its new “Arrival Notifications,” users can now set one-time or recurring alerts for locations beyond their home, providing an automatic way to share when they’ve arrived at specific places.

“Arrival Notifications now work for everyday moments — like letting someone know you’re back for the night while traveling, or automatically sharing when you arrive at a weekly class, practice, or meeting — without needing to remember to send a message,” the company wrote in a blog post.

As with the platform’s Home Safe alerts, Arrival Notifications can only be sent to friends you choose to share your location with. It’s worth noting that location sharing on Snap Map is off by default. No one can see your location or receive an alert unless you choose to share it, Snapchat explained. One-time alerts expire after they’re sent or after 24 hours.

To use Arrival Notifications, you need to share your location with a trusted friend that you want to keep in the loop. Then, you need to tap on your friendship profile and scroll down to “Arrival Notifications.” You can pick a location on the map and give it a personal name. For example, you could set the location for your “run club” or the location for “piano lessons.” You can then choose a one-time or recurring alert, after which Snapchat will notify your friend when you arrive.

The new feature comes as Snapchat announced last summer that Snap Map now has more than 400 million monthly active users.

Snap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. The feature now also offers ways for users to discover local hotspots and find things to do.

With its Home Safe and Arrival Notifications features, Snapchat is looking to further compete with services like the family location-sharing app Life360 and Apple’s “Find My.”

The transactions contain records of payments for phone-tracking services like Geofinder and uMobix, as well as services like Peekviewer (formerly Glassagram), which purport to allow access to private Instagram accounts, among several other monitoring and tracking apps provided by the same vendor, a Ukrainian company called Struktura.

The customer data also includes transaction records from Xnspy, a known phone surveillance app, which in 2022 spilled the private data from tens of thousands of unsuspecting people’s Android devices and iPhones.

This is the latest example of a surveillance vendor exposing the information of its customers due to security flaws. Over the past few years, dozens of stalkerware apps have been hacked, or have managed to lose, spill, or expose people’s private data — often the victims themselves — thanks to shoddy cybersecurity by the stalkerware operators.

Stalkerware apps like uMobix and Xnspy, once planted on someone’s phone, upload the victim’s private data, including their call records, text messages, photos, browsing history, and precise location data, which is then shared with the person who planted the app.

Apps like uMobix and Xnspy have explicitly marketed their services for people to spy on their spouses and domestic partners, which is illegal.

The data, seen by TechCrunch, included about 536,000 lines of customer email addresses, which app or brand the customer paid for, how much they paid, the payment card type (such as Visa or Mastercard), and the last four digits on the card. The customer records did not include dates of payments.

TechCrunch verified the data was authentic by taking several transaction records containing disposable email addresses with public inboxes, such as Mailinator, and running them through the various password reset portals provided by the various surveillance apps. By resetting the passwords on accounts associated with public email addresses, we determined that these were real accounts.

We also verified the data by matching each transaction’s unique invoice number from the leaked dataset with the surveillance vendor’s checkout pages. We could do this because the checkout page allowed us to retrieve the same customer and transaction data from the server without needing a password.

The hacktivist, who goes by the moniker “wikkid,” told TechCrunch they scraped the data from the stalkerware vendor thanks to a “trivial” bug in its website. The hacktivist said they “have fun targeting apps that are used to spy on people,” and subsequently published the scraped data on a known hacking forum.

The hacking forum listing lists the surveillance vendor as Ersten Group, which presents itself as a U.K.-presenting software development startup.

TechCrunch found several email addresses in the dataset used for testing and customer support instead reference Struktura, a Ukrainian company that has an identical website to Ersten Group. The earliest record in the dataset contained the email address for Struktura’s chief executive, Viktoriia Zosim, for a transaction of $1.

Representatives for Ersten Group did not respond to our requests for comment. Struktura’s Zosim did not return a request for comment.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/youtube-tv-introduces-cheaper-bundles-including-a-65-month-sports-package/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube on Monday introduced lower-priced YouTube TV plans that will allow subscribers to better tailor their plans to their own interests in areas like sports, news, and entertainment. The company said that it will offer more than 10 different plans to choose from, all priced below the $82.99 per month main YouTube TV plan that has access to more than 100 networks. The new plans will start rolling out this week.

While that main plan will not go away, the new plans will allow customers to pick what matters most and what they could do without in return for cost savings.

Among the new plans are a $64.99 per month Sports plan, a Sports + News plan for $71.99 per month, a less expensive Entertainment plan for $54.99 per month, and a $69.99 per month News + Entertainment + Family plan, which includes kids’ content.

The Sports plans include all major broadcasters, plus networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks, and ESPN Unlimited. This plan is $18 cheaper per month than the main plan.

YouTube TV’s news channels include CNBC, Fox News, CNN, MS NOW, and Bloomberg, along with other national news channels. Combined with Sports, the package is priced $11 lower per month than the main YouTube TV plan.

The entertainment-only plan is $28 cheaper per month than the main plan, and includes major broadcasters as well as FX, Hallmark, Comedy Central, Bravo, Paramount, Food Network, and HGTV. Families with small kids can add other channels like Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Cartoon Network, and PBS Kids for a bit more.

The company is also offering discounts for new subscribers, which could lower the price of certain plans further for either the first few months or the first year. Subscribers will continue to have access to YouTube TV’s unlimited DVR, support for up to six family members on one account, multiview, and more.

Other add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket + RedZone, HBO Max, and 4K Plus can also be purchased to customize plans further.

The company says all the new plans will roll out over the next several weeks.

Customized packages are now not a new idea in streaming — à la carte options were a key part of the early streaming pioneer Sling TV’s initial offering, for instance. This element of personalization was also one of the factors that was meant to make streaming a better alternative to traditional pay TV, where consumers often ended up paying for channels they didn’t want.

But as streamers added more content, networks, and, in particular, sports programming, the cost of streaming inched back up to compete with cable and linear television. Live TV streamers like YouTube TV may have offered convenience and some savings over still more expensive cable, but it wasn’t exactly affordable anymore.

These new packages hit the market at a time when consumer confidence is at its lowest in more than 11 years, due to fears about the labor market and higher prices, which have made consumers more cautious about their spending.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/discord-to-roll-out-age-verification-next-month-for-full-access-to-its-platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Discord is rolling out age verification globally starting next month, the company announced on Monday. All users will be put into a “teen-appropriate experience” by default unless they prove they’re adults. Age verification will be required to change certain settings and access age-restricted content.

Discord users will need to be confirmed as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting, and only adults can access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands. Additionally, messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and only verified adults can modify this setting.

People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know, and only adults will be able speak onstage in servers.

To complete age verification, users need to either complete a facial age estimation or submit an ID to Discord’s vendor partners. The platform plans to add more options in the future. Discord notes that some users may be asked to use multiple methods when additional information is needed to assign an age group.

The facial age estimation requires video selfies, which Discord says never leave your device. Additionally, the company says IDs submitted to its vendor partners are deleted quickly and, in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.

It’s worth noting that Discord disclosed last October that around 70,000 users may have had sensitive data, such as their government ID photos, exposed after hackers breached a third-party vendor that the platform uses for age-related appeals. The breach reflected digital rights activists’ concerns over the use of age checks as a way to make the internet “safer.”

Discord’s global launch of age verification follows the company’s decision to establish age checks for users in the U.K. and Australia last year.

“Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility,” said Savannah Badalich, head of product policy at Discord, in a press release. “We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform.”

The announcement mirrors similar moves made by other online platforms, reflecting growing international efforts to strengthen child safety. Most recently, Roblox introduced mandatory facial verification for access to chats on its platform. Last July, YouTube launched its age-estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience.

Discord’s age-verification changes will begin in early March, and both new and existing users will need to verify their age to access age-restricted content.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hurry, hurry, hurry! Everybody, to the bunker! It is halftime at the Super Bowl, and what is happening on the field is un-American in a way I won’t specify!

Isn’t Bad Bunny an American artist? Don’t millions of people love his music? Didn’t he just win the Album of the Year Grammy? No time, no time! We must get into the bunker quickly for the All-American halftime!

Is the president going to watch with us? What kind of a question is that! Imagine the president not watching the Turning Point USA All-American Halftime Show, streaming live on the TPUSA channel on YouTube (but not X.com, due to last-minute technical difficulties) on or around 8 p.m. ET, during the Super Bowl. If there’s one thing we know about President Donald J. Trump, it’s that what’s good enough for his devoted fans is exactly what he likes best himself, and he absolutely will not just tune in to the Super Bowl and watch the actual halftime show. Don’t worry—he is right there with us, fiddling with YouTube as we are!

Shh! Here comes Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, with a special welcome message about “this halftime show that the War Department is proud to support!” Hey, Pete threw a football! God, he’s cool. Cool isn’t being comfortable in your own skin. Cool is making your whole family watch … a guy in a backward baseball cap, red sneakers, and skinny jeans play the national anthem on the electric guitar in what appears to be a sealed bunker.

Heck yeah! Now we’re talking! One thing I always think about the Super Bowl halftime show is, This could be indoors. And this is the most indoors anyone has ever looked. Is this live from the mines of Moria? Is this the president’s new, extra-secure vault under the East Wing? Either way, you can tell it’s cool because, again, the cap is backward.

What do you mean Bad Bunny just fell through a roof, there was a wedding, and Pedro Pascal is there? Who cares? In the bunker, Lee Brice, the singer of the 2014 hit(?) “The Drinking Class,” is debuting a special new song with lyrics about how hard it is to be country in this country nowadays!

What is America nowadays? Let the lyrics from this wondrous patriot extravaganza (not to be confused with the Super Bowl itself, a Patriot blowout) explain it to you! “Old Glory’s on a can. / And everything’s made in the U.S.A. / Hand on your heart when the song gets played.” What do Americans want? “To catch my fish, drive my truck, drink my beer / and not wake up to all this stuff I don’t want to hear.” America is a man who cheated on you getting cheated on himself! Whereas a good American man is “a phone call to his parents. He’s a Bible by the bed.” America is an ill-advised rap breakdown: “I sit back and think about them good ol’ days. The way we were raised and our southern ways.” That’s my country!

Yes, I know. I know Bad Bunny is a U.S. citizen. You know what I’m trying to say. He’s Puerto Rican. Yes, I know Puerto Rico is part of America. But. You know. You know what I’m saying. A real American artist would speak English. Or at the very least, recently translated German. Like the DHS X account.

This isn’t a dog whistle. That’s my smoke alarm. I’m burning the nachos! No, Nachos are all-American. Yeah, I’m pretty sure. Well, the way I make them, they are. Have some salsa. Yes, it’s mild.

It’s nice to be here, watching this all-American halftime show, with all the real Americans. You know we outnumber the people watching the other show? Yeah. Five million to 135 million. (It helps if we don’t count all of them as people.)

Come down, come down, where it’s nice and dark and safe, and hear Kid Rock perform not once, but twice! Don’t worry: This concludes with a memorial of Charlie Kirk, so if anyone criticizes it online, that person will be removed from their position, drawn, and quartered!

So. For, confusingly, even more minutes than halftime lasts, please enjoy only what is safe to enjoy! No one will bang down your door for watching this! No agents of the state will yank you out of a stadium for bopping along to this! Play this as loud in your car as you’d like!

Now put your hands together for: Kid Rock, again and again! Forever! Singing “Bawitdaba”! Or, well, jumping around while it plays! Far more important that the performer not be, well, you know—you know—than that the performance be complete, outdoors, or live. Mr. Rock is jumping around the stage in shorts! He is wearing a hat! Did Bad Bunny wear a cool hat like Mr. Rock? Did Bad Bunny also frequently adjust the hat?

No, no, no, no, no! Do not answer that! Don’t you dare Google it!

We must not see how the rest of the country is living. We must not allow ourselves to suspect that they are America too.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a Wednesday evening in mid-June, Ralph Coolman, a small-business owner and accomplished athlete, set out to run a 5K in Ventura, California. He quit after a mile, and spent the next few days afflicted by nausea, indigestion, and exhaustion. His wife, Erika, a nurse and an athlete herself, figured he had the flu. But on Saturday morning, Ralph began breathing rapidly. She rushed him to an urgent-care center, where a doctor put him on oxygen and sent him to the emergency room. Four or five hours after he arrived, Ralph was dead of a heart attack at the age of 62. Shortly after, Community Memorial Hospital told Erika his care would cost roughly $270,000.

“We always had insurance—always,” Erika told me. But when Ralph got sick, she was in the process of changing jobs. Erika initially did not opt to cover Ralph on the COBRA plan she was using as a stopgap, because he was going to purchase individual coverage. She later changed her mind and sent a check in to cover his premium. The insurer “ended up adding two months on for me” instead of adding her husband, she told me. “I didn’t find out until it was too late.” Ralph was uninsured when he died, thanks to the complexity of the American insurance system. That left his family on the hook for an enormous bill they couldn’t begin to understand, again thanks to the complexity of the American health-care system.

While grieving, Erika had to put together her husband’s memorial service, try to keep his business afloat, and handle the mundane bureaucracy of death: legal certificates, beneficiaries, account issues, estate management. “Ralph thought he was invincible,” Erika told me. “He didn’t make any preparations.” Matt Rosenberg, Erika’s brother-in-law, added, “It’s really hard to see paperwork through tears.”

After Erika tried and failed to appeal the COBRA issue, she was inclined to pay the hospital what she could “and be done with it,” Rosenberg told me. “I was like, no, no, no. That’s what they count on—people making big decisions in confusing moments. Send me everything. I will deal with it. We’re not going to be those people. I’m not scared of a fight.”

The Coolman family had experienced a sudden trauma and ended up enmeshed in what Chad Maisel of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive think tank, and Neale Mahoney, an economist at Stanford, call “the annoyance economy” in a new study: “the steady grind of small hassles that eat away at our time, patience, and wallets,” turning simple interactions into “fraught ordeals, leaving people feeling overwhelmed, ignored, or jerked around.”

To be sure, consumers have never had an easier time spending their money. You can choose from among millions of films on your iPhone in an instant, buy a plane ticket to Bali in minutes, get a restaurant meal delivered in an hour, and have a full house’s worth of furniture placed in your home in a few days. Yet businesses have also embedded countless frictions into the consumer experience. You might expect such hassles in health care, but they’re everywhere. We live in a world of “total bureaucracy,” as the anthropologist David Graeber put it. Our grandparents bought goods and services outright, but we purchase subscriptions and rentals and insurance coverage and contracts, handling rebates and intermediaries and applications and enrollment periods. As of 2018, the country had 826,537,000 consumer-arbitration agreements in force, one study found. And that’s an undercount.

“Companies have worked really hard to make it easy for you” to spend, Lindsay Owens, the executive director of Groundwork, told me. “Of course, when it comes to trying to get out of a purchase or out of a subscription, the same design choices are flipped and reversed.” She likened digital consumer platforms to Las Vegas casinos. Designers create colorful playgrounds with flashing lights and free drinks and chandeliers and mirrors and water features, where gamblers never know what time it is and never see a path to the exit.

The American government doesn’t help the situation. Washington wraps essential programs in red tape, forcing millions of people who have lost a job, lost their insurance coverage, developed a disability, given birth to a child, gotten divorced, or slid into poverty to pay a tithe in paperwork before accessing aid. The government shuns universal, direct services and opts for subsidies, grants, credits, and loan guarantees. It works through nonprofits and contractors and subgovernments, so people rarely know what is on offer and who is actually providing it. Washington underinvests in agile digital systems. (Why on earth does part of the Social Security website have business hours?) It declines to provide the automatic services many other wealthy countries do, such as free tax preparation. It shifts the work of public administration onto the public, creating “time taxes,” as I call them, everywhere.

Moreover, the government allows or even encourages private businesses to entrap customers in bureaucratic mazes. As Graeber argued, Washington “provides the legal framework” and “the elaborate mechanisms of enforcement.” The American government lets insurers deny necessary medical procedures, just as it lets hospitals make up prices and hide them from patients. It lets employers foist extortionate contract terms on workers. It lets airlines and gyms and multilevel marketing companies and landlords and time-share businesses and auto companies and banks and telecoms swindle their customers with fine print.

Maisel and Mahoney decided to try to count the hours lost to this “total bureaucracy” and tally up the annual cost to the public: $8 billion for robocalls, $25 billion for phone scams, $22 billion for phone calls (just phone calls!) with insurance administrators, $90 billion for junk fees, $19 billion for medical waiting times, $2 billion for governmental wait times. The annoyance economy saps American families of $165 billion a year, they estimated. And that’s an undercount.

Rosenberg, who works in marketing consulting, was determined to get his sister-in-law’s bill down. He was willing to spend his time negotiating. He asked the hospital for an itemized bill. The hospital offered the Coolmans a discount, knocking the total down to a little less than $200,000. Rosenberg asked for the itemized bill again. The hospital sent him a document with proprietary procedure codes, “meaning I couldn’t look them up anywhere. They only existed inside the hospital’s computer.”

The family kept trying to speak with a human being in the billing office. “The person we were supposed to be talking to kept ignoring us,” Erika said. “At one point, she admitted that she wasn’t taking care of us, and blamed it on the fact that they had gotten new computers five months before.” Eventually, Community Memorial provided Rosenberg with a “complicated form filled with boxes for codes and procedures and costs and patient information and hospital information and all kinds of things that no human being can understand.”

Rosenberg fed the document into Claude, an AI system, and asked it to figure out what Medicare would have paid for his brother-in-law’s care, while also flagging any confusing or questionable codes. After some back-and-forth with the chatbot, Rosenberg realized that the hospital might have over- and double-billed the family. Medicare likely would have reimbursed the hospital $28,675 for the services Ralph actually received. Claude helped Rosenberg write a stern letter, calling Community Memorial’s pricing practices “unconscionable” and noting that it had marked up certain tests by 2,300 percent. In the end, Erika Coolman and Community Memorial agreed on a total of $32,000. (The hospital declined to comment.)

The AI system equalized the asymmetries between institution and individual, Rosenberg told me. “Claude could search the Medicare rules and regulations in a way that I could have, I guess, but it would have been time-consuming, tedious, and I probably would have given up.” Others have used Claude and ChatGPT to help them negotiate with their internet providers, write letters to airlines, understand employment contracts, and slash through the fine print on retail deals.

Yet powerful institutions are adopting AI too, pushing those asymmetries right back up again and creating new ways for companies to screw over the public. Consumers are shuffled to chatbots instead of human agents. AI algorithms track customers and present them with different prices and contract terms. “Algorithms could make life easier,” Owens said. “But it is dizzying to think about the additional shifts coming.”

The only solution is for the government to do its job. It should require companies to act transparently. And it should protect consumers from extractive administrative practices. Granted, voters rarely make it to the polls or switch their political affiliation to support click-to-cancel rules and arcane insurance regulations. But restrictions on robocalls and hidden fees are among the most popular policy proposals out there, on a bipartisan basis; two-thirds of Americans think that Congress should address these time-wasting, income-sapping frustrations.

This winter, Erika started getting a new round of bills from providers involved in Ralph’s care. “That wasn’t good,” she said. Now the family is just refusing to pay.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Greenlanders own a lot of guns: more than 35,000 long rifles, on an island of 56,000 people. Everyone I met there in January knew how to hunt. And more than one person made clear to me that they were ready to stand their ground against a possible American invasion.

“I have 10 hunting rifles,” Finn told me when I visited his home in Nuuk. (He asked me to withhold his full name because “taking credit for things is not the Greenland way.”)  “I am a decent shot,” he added, “but not as good as my friends, who can hit a seal in the water at 200 meters, from a moving boat.”

Nuuk, a city of no more than 20,000 people, is serviced by one of very few runways in a wilderness more than three times the size of Texas. Finn was born there, to a Danish father and an Inuit mother. “You must know,” he told me—after we’d sat for an hour or so over tea and salted musk ox, and he had come to trust that I was not one of the “other” Americans—“that I will defend my home.”

The “other” Americans had also been to visit. In early 2025, right-wing influencers roamed downtown Nuuk, handing out $100 bills to children and telling them to pose for cameras while wearing free MAGA swag. I, too, encountered a group of children—on a climb up the tallest hill (in Ohio we would call it a mountain) overlooking the capital. Four kids scampered past. “We don’t like Trump!” they said on hearing my accent.

Looking down on the airfield below, I was struck by the forbidding topography. Steep, snow-covered mountains flanked the icy fjords. The word that came to mind was desolate. Jacob Kaarsbo, one of my climbing companions, was a former Danish intelligence officer and an expert on Greenland’s defense.

“There are only a handful of runways that we have to defend,” he told me. “And in the north,” he added, “there are villages where the next living soul is 1,000 miles away.” Danish special forces maintain a presence in those wild expanses. Monthslong expeditions known as Sirius Patrol rely on sled-dog teams, and serve to remind any interloper that Greenland is not for the taking.

President Trump recently mocked the sled-dog teams. But in the frozen North, the only vehicles that can operate reliably are sleds pulled by dogs. People have tried using machines, but the cold turns oil to sludge, and when machines fall through ice, they can’t be pulled out. If a sled breaks through, it floats long enough to be recovered. If dogs and men fall through, they pull themselves out, drag their sleds onto thicker ice, and carry on.

Two hours north of the capital sits a fishing village accessible only by boat. We left Nuuk’s port before sunrise, and once we were in the fjord, we navigated past slabs of ice until we reached the settlement. Most of Greenland’s inhabitants live in towns like this: a one-room schoolhouse, a chapel, a lone medic equipped to treat only minor injuries. Anyone with a serious health issue has to be evacuated to Nuuk by boat. As we approached the dock, a small hunting party was casting off.

The village may be one of the most isolated in the world. But even there, people asked me: “What does America want?” By their reckoning, Greenlanders already provided everything the United States could want. “Is it true,” one of the villagers asked, “that your president has a ‘psychological need’ to own us?” Some in the village wanted to believe that Trump had never said this, that the reports were fake.

Throughout the settlement, I noticed animal carcasses nailed to the sides of homes. Most were small game—birds and hares—but I also saw a quartered reindeer. This was the local method of refrigeration, and the villagers survived on subsistence hunting. I found myself thinking about the gun culture back home—performative, based on a myth of self-sufficiency. In this Greenlandic village, gun ownership was rooted in the requirements of an unforgiving environment. Walking back to the boat, I saw a blood trail that led up from the dock. The hunting party had been successful.

Trump’s posture toward Greenland has had a very real impact on the people who live there. Three nights before my visit, the power failed in Nuuk. One woman I spoke with was convinced that the Americans were coming. Many of her friends thought the same. “Venezuela,” she said. “The first thing the Americans did was cut the power.” The next morning, calls to the mental-health crisis line in Nuuk spiked.

Part of me wondered whether this was an overreaction. Then Orla Joelsen, a local guide, showed me a building that sat mostly empty in the center of town.

“It is waiting,” Joelsen said, “for the Americans.”

The U.S. government has long maintained a minimal presence in Nuuk: one permanent consular representative and a handful of other staff. That has been more than enough for as long as anyone can remember. Now the U.S. has leased this new building, which it has yet to occupy, and which covers tens of thousands of square feet, with enough office space for more than 100 people. To the locals, the facility looms as the likely headquarters for a coming occupation.

The Greenlanders I met will not submit easily. They seemed ready to fight, and more than capable. Greenlandic and Danish authorities were also preparing. Warships from Denmark arrived at the harbor during my visit. My guide told me that until recently, he had never seen guards at the port, where heavily armed Danish soldiers now checked vehicles entering and leaving. “It is not because of the Russians,” Joelsen said. “It is because of the Americans.”

In late January, the Greenlandic government posted an alert advising all residents to prepare to “fend for yourself for five days if a crisis arises.” The notice included recommendations on stockpiling medicine, batteries, and fuel, as well as tips on surviving without power or water. Similar circulars have been issued before, in anticipation of major storms and other natural events. But this one included something new: “Consider access to hunting weapons.” That was a call to arms.

“The more people who can fend for themselves and help others, the stronger we stand as a society,” the alert added. “Do what you can and help those around you. Fortunately, we are good at that.”

In Nuuk, stores were running low on ammunition, not because people were afraid of one another, nor because they needed that much ammo to hunt. “The bullets are for the Americans,” one local told me, “if they come.” He assured me that the government was working to replenish the depleted ammunition supply.

The Greenlanders I met were warm and welcoming, but not without a fierce pride. Their ancestors had carved a civilization out of the ice with tools made from whalebone and meteorite fragments. They’d hewn garments from cured whale intestine, sealskin, and thick polar-bear fur—still the warmest insulation on Earth. Today’s Greenlanders are prepared to defend what they have built here.

“If we are pushed,” Finn told me, “we are ready to die.”

That’s a fight America has no reason to pick. It’s also one that America could lose.</div>

In the winter of 168 C.E., the famed Greek physician Galen arrived in Aquileia, an Italian city on the northern edge of the Adriatic. The city had grown large since its founding as a Roman colony, but during the 200-year Pax Romana, its fortifications had been allowed to deteriorate. After an armed group of migrating Germanic peoples had crossed the Danube a year earlier, the Roman co-emperors, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, had rushed to the city, raising two legions and rebuilding its defenses; they planned to use it as a base of operations against the invaders.

Galen had been summoned, however, to help fight a different kind of invader. A plague, likely an early variant of smallpox, had traveled to Aquileia with the troops, and held the city in its grip. The emperors fled, but Verus succumbed to the disease on the road to Rome. Galen tried to slow the wave of illness, but most of the people in Aquileia perished.

They represented just a sliver of the eventual victims of the Antonine Plague, also known as Galen’s Plague, which killed at least 1 million people throughout the Roman empire. It was possibly the world’s first true pandemic, and haunted the empire for the rest of the Pax Romana, which ended in 180 with Aurelius’s death. The details of the pandemic—the exact pathogen, the true number of victims—are subjects of debate, and might never be fully settled. But some research has cited the Antonine Plague as part of a vicious cycle that hastened Rome’s long fall. Food shortages, internal migrations, and overcrowding had already signaled a slippage in imperial power, and created a fertile environment for disease. The pandemic, in turn, spread panic and left behind mistrust, weakening faith in civic and religious authorities.

Men famously think about Rome every day, and political commentators have been nervously comparing Rome’s fall to a potential American collapse since before America even had a Constitution. But Rome’s example really does merit consideration in light of recent events. One of the better measures of a society’s vitality is its ability to protect its citizens from disease, and the two often move in tandem; a decline in one may produce a reduction in the other.

Infectious disease is probably not an imminent threat to the United States’ survival. Still, after nearly a century of existence, the American public-health apparatus, which has driven some of the most remarkable advances in global longevity and quality of life in human history, is teetering. The country has lost much of its ability to keep microbes from invading its body politic, and progress in life expectancy and other metrics is slowing or even reversing.

It is tempting to lay these changes all at the feet of President Trump and his current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who together have shredded America’s global-health organizations, drawn back public-health funding, fomented vaccine skepticism, and begun to dismantle child-vaccination programs. But the “Make America Healthy Again” moment is in some ways just another step in the long retreat of the civic trust and communitarian spirit that have enabled America’s disease-fighting efforts. If this retreat continues, the public-health era—the century-long period of unprecedented epidemiological safety that has been the foundation for so many other breakthroughs—will come to an end. And that end will have dire consequences for this republic and its future.

In January 2025, a hospital in West Texas began reporting that children were coming in sick with measles. The cases were initially clustered in a Mennonite community, where vaccination rates had been low in recent decades. But soon the outbreak spread around the state, and to others; the reported number of cases reached more than 1,800 by the year’s end. As of this writing, the outbreak is still ongoing, and America is in danger of having its measles-elimination status revoked by the World Health Organization.

On August 8, as the measles outbreak continued to make headlines, a man named Patrick Joseph White entered a CVS in northeast Atlanta and fired hundreds of rounds from a rifle into the CDC’s headquarters across the street. According to Georgia investigators, White had been suicidal, and believed that COVID‑19 vaccines were part of a conspiracy to sicken him and other Americans.

These were but two signs among many that something has broken within the systems that protect the population’s health. Despite all of our advantages, the coronavirus pandemic caused more confirmed deaths per capita in the United States than in any other Western country, and our mortality rate’s recovery has lagged behind others’. Life expectancy in the U.S. is lower than in other high-income nations, and the gulf is widening.

America is unique, and comparisons are difficult. The country easily outpaces the rest of the developed world in gun deaths and overdoses, both major mortality drivers here that have largely been accepted as the cost of being American. But even if you discount those peculiarities, plenty of other indicators are pointing the wrong way. Foodborne illnesses appear to be on the rise, including regular surges of norovirus. Deteriorating water-delivery and sewage systems have contributed to a growing number of outbreaks of legionella. Cases of tetanus, whooping cough, and hepatitis A have also risen in recent years.

Many problems contribute to these shifts—insufficient investments in infrastructure, budget cuts in state and local health departments, the growing drug resistance of bacteria. Yet underlying all of the outbreaks, and even gun and opioid deaths, is a common theme: a declining sense of mutual responsibility among Americans. If the population could be analogized to a single human body, then its immune system would rely on a concert of action and purpose between each cell. When that concert stops, the body dies.

In 1946, the year the U.S. Public Health Service founded its Communicable Disease Center, American life expectancy at birth was about 66 years. Malaria was rampant in the South, and fever diseases, tuberculosis, syphilis, and polio killed tens of thousands of Americans annually. Thirty-four out of every 1,000 children born in 1946 were expected to die before their first birthday, many from communicable diseases. America was moving toward modernity, but the risks people faced were of a different order than they are today.

The CDC (since renamed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) inherited much of its early mandate from a U.S. military campaign to control infectious diseases among soldiers fighting in World War II. The scale of the war effort had necessitated the creation of a health infrastructure on American soil—spraying for mosquitoes near the front lines in the Pacific wouldn’t mean anything if soldiers caught malaria at home before deployment. Responses to outbreaks near bases needed to be big and fast enough to account for car travel beyond military jurisdictions. When the CDC took over, it extended this paradigm—of coordination across long distances and disparate communities—to the civilian population.

From the June 2020 issue: Vann R. Newkirk II on how America handles catastrophe

The same year the CDC was created, the influenza vaccine reached the public, and international organizations, supported by the U.S., began a global push to eliminate tuberculosis. The agency worked to promote mass vaccination. It began a national disease-surveillance program, and shared intelligence with cash-strapped county health departments and state agencies. Wartime campaigns to coax and chide Americans into doing their part to conserve resources and volunteer for the war effort translated easily into pushes for vaccination and sanitation.

Before 1946, conquering disease would have seemed as much a subject of science fiction as putting a man on the moon. But since 1950, global life expectancy has risen by four years each decade. Smallpox has been eradicated, and polio and malaria cases have dramatically fallen. Within the past 80 years, there have perhaps been more significant advances in human health than there were in the previous 300,000.

On the home front, several generations have grown up on an American mainland without malaria, yellow fever, or typhoid fever; diseases like dysentery are medical rarities. Measles and polio, once routine scourges of childhood, were pushed back by millions of vaccinations. Life expectancy increased by more than a decade, to 78 in 2023. This was a public-health revolution, on equal footing with any of the great agricultural, industrial, or information revolutions that have punctuated the past few centuries.

Those other great revolutions are often considered to be the result of technological advances—the plow, steam power, fertilizers, the internet. And certainly, the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and other medicines has played a tremendous role in the advance of human health. But vaccines for smallpox and some other diseases had been around for at least half a century before the 1940s, and had failed to create widespread immunity. The real public-health revolution was first and foremost a change in the way people thought about themselves and their relationship to one another.

Epidemiology made a new kind of thinking necessary. Pathogens respect neither individuals nor borders. Vaccinations and other preventatives against ever-evolving germs do not on their own guarantee personal safety—only eradication can do that. And eradication, it came to be understood, can be achieved only through local and global cooperation.

In America, where capitalist and individualist ethics have always predominated, public health nonetheless managed to carve out a large cooperative space. Before the 1940s, the United States was still reporting a relatively high number of smallpox cases compared with other similarly industrialized nations; it achieved total elimination in 1949. With the insistence of a growing public-health apparatus, it became common practice to wash our hands, to cover our mouths, to not smoke indoors, and to get tested—not just for our own benefit, but for the sake of the people around us. Parents waited in long lines to have their children inoculated, and enterprising physicians went to rural clinics to reach the last isolated clusters of unvaccinated people.

That is not to say America’s particular system of public health was ever perfect. Owing partly to the legacy of segregation, the country never developed a universal health-insurance program, and maintains a fragmented health-care system in which both class and race still dictate much of a patient’s access to care. Many people on the margins who have wanted to get screened for certain diseases or vaccinated against them have not been able to do so, because they cannot afford to or because no doctor will serve them.

And yet, sometimes through the insistence of those same people that America live up to the tenets of public health, the system has come closer to the ideal. As much as any other institution—schools, libraries, churches—the public-health system has helped propagate the idea of a commons, often working against historical inertia to curb the excesses of American individualism. That work has always required energy and effort from the people. And so it has always been vulnerable, because that energy and effort could dissipate at any time.

There is ample evidence that this is exactly what is happening. According to the health-policy organization KFF, in the summer of 2025 just 83 percent of parents kept their children up to date on vaccines, down from 90 percent four years earlier. Cases are surging for several of the diseases covered by the national vaccine schedule. Tuberculosis cases are higher than they have been in a dozen years, and meningococcal disease is rising as well. Measles cases have trended upward for years too, even before 2025.

Over the past 50 years, American trust in the medical system has declined, as has trust in government, science, and expertise in general. The coronavirus pandemic exploded those trends, creating the world in which we now find ourselves. Public-health agencies did themselves no favors: They often gave out confusing and sometimes conflicting advice. Conspiracy theories grew quickly on social media, and measures such as masking became subject to partisan polarization. According to Gallup, a bare majority—just 51 percent—of Americans now favors government requirements for vaccines, down from 81 percent in 1991 and 62 percent in 2019. Most of the slippage has been among conservatives, and studies suggest that political ideology is perhaps the biggest predictor of vaccine rejection.

Medicine has kept moving forward, with some truly great results. Deaths in the U.S. from cardiovascular disease are plummeting, and might see further declines with the advance of GLP‑1 drugs. With the advent of better cancer-screening tools, survival rates are improving, and wonder-drug therapeutics for many conditions are now on the market. But personalized care of this sort is expensive, and does not keep us collectively safe from infectious disease.

Meanwhile, as viruses that once killed hundreds of thousands have receded from public memory, they have come to seem less fearsome. Owing to the near eradication of some diseases, there have been few real risks to the heretofore small portion of people who refuse vaccines. In this landscape, organizations such as the CDC, which once stood as unimpeachable examples of government competence, have become victims of their own success, appearing to skeptics to be inert or irrelevant.

This was the system as Trump and Kennedy found it last year, vulnerable and stripped of the halo of public trust. Kennedy slashed agency budgets and stocked a key vaccine advisory committee with vaccine skeptics, then this past January announced a new set of childhood-vaccine recommendations that excluded coverage for rotavirus, influenza, and hepatitis A, which all now cannot be administered to most patients without a doctor’s consultation.

Kennedy’s biggest threat to public health comes from what he symbolizes. The MAHA movement derides expertise, overemphasizes personal commitment and liberty, and has embraced pseudoscience. This stance, mingled with Trump world’s conspiratorial tendencies, has turned the CDC and other once-trusted institutions into targets. After the August shooting at CDC headquarters, hundreds of current and former Health and Human Services employees singled out Kennedy as a driver of the kind of rhetoric that had motivated Patrick Joseph White, referring to the secretary’s previous insinuations that the CDC itself was hiding information about the risks of COVID vaccines.

Marcus Aurelius, the surviving Roman emperor, is mostly famous in our time because of his Stoicism. His philosophy encouraged the embrace of duty, not because of the expectation of praise or other material benefits but because duty is in itself fulfillment of the human condition. In his Meditations, he offered a maxim: “Do your duty—whether shivering or warm, never mind; heavy-eyed, or with your fill of sleep; in evil report or in good report; dying or with other work in hand.”

It’s hard to psychoanalyze a guy who lived two millennia ago, but it’s easy to believe that this particular admonishment may have come from his time as a plague fighter. In the face of Galen’s “everlasting pestilence,” Marcus had to rally the public and improvise, stocking depleted armies with convicts and ordering the digging of mass graves. He saw that the state was held up not just by the military or territory, but by invisible webs of shared sacrifice and obligation. In the end, the fortifications that mattered most were those that strengthened Rome against the invaders that could not be seen.

If the American state disintegrates, future postmortems are unlikely to focus much on measles, or on rotavirus vaccination rates. But the ability to beat back our more routine pathological menaces is a good indicator of the country’s ability to take on bigger, more virulent threats. The thing about bacteria and viruses, our most ancient foes, is that they are always at the gates, waiting for lean times. Among them will be pathogens worse than the coronavirus.

In the main, the withering of public health might not anticipate a future apocalypse so much as it recalls a previous America, one where lives were cheaper and shorter, where good health was the province of a privileged few, and where epidemics regularly scoured the countryside and the city slums. What’s spurring the slide now isn’t a dearth of information or cutting-edge medicine. Rather, the precepts of a shared reality have been shattered, and with them the ability to act for a common cause.

            <h2>The Mark Kelly Case Is Bigger Than It Seems</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/pete-hegseth-mark-kelly-court/685911/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of the many questions posed by those gathered in U.S. District Judge Richard Leon’s courtroom last week, the most obvious one of all never came up: Why on earth was anyone here in the first place?

Until now, the military has pursued only a tiny number of criminal cases against retirees for actions that occur after military service has ended. Until now, the idea that the secretary of defense would accuse a lawmaker of treason simply for disagreeing with him would be laughable. Until now, any free-speech debates concerning sitting members of Congress have led to the conclusion that lawmakers ought to have—to borrow from former Chief Justice Earl Warren—the widest possible latitude to express themselves.

And yet there we all were anyway, gathered to see Mark Kelly—the fighter pilot turned astronaut turned U.S. senator—defend his First Amendment rights against an attempt by the Pentagon chief, Pete Hegseth, to silence him and knock down his military retirement rank and pay.

As someone who’s covered 10 secretaries of defense, I’ve never seen anything like what Hegseth is doing—not even close. If Hegseth gets his way, he won’t just be punishing Kelly; he will succeed in dramatically curbing the First Amendment rights of all military retirees, some of the very people who have fought to defend such freedoms.

At the heart of the case is a November video in which Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers—all veterans of the military or intelligence agencies—address U.S. troops, reminding them that they “can and must refuse illegal orders.” Their goal with the video was to push back against the president’s domestic troop deployments, a trend his critics feared might lead to clashes with ordinary Americans or be used to interfere in upcoming elections. At the time the video was posted, Democrats were also assailing the administration over the legality of its air campaign against suspected Latin American drug boats. The lawmakers did not specify which problematic orders they had in mind.

The Trump administration’s response was swift. Adviser Stephen Miller called the video an attempted “insurrection.” Donald Trump declared that the “traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” and reposted suggestions that they be hanged. Hegseth ordered the Navy to look into Kelly’s “potentially unlawful” comments, something he was able to do because Kelly is the only one in the video who receives benefits as a military retiree. (Although some 18 million military veterans are living in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, a much smaller share of those people reach retirement status.) Kelly now receives lifelong retirement pay and is subject to rules, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In early January, Hegseth issued Kelly a letter of censure over his “seditious statements and his pattern of reckless misconduct,” which, Hegseth said, had harmed military discipline and undermined the chain of command. He also asked Navy Secretary John Phelan (a Republican donor and billionaire art collector with no naval experience) to begin a review of Kelly’s retirement rank and pay.

The Trump administration’s attempts to go after Kelly are, several legal experts told me, straightforwardly outrageous and without merit. But even if the judge rules in Kelly’s favor, it’s worth paying attention to this fight, because it underscores the degree to which the Trump administration is seeking to expand executive power in novel ways. Far more is at stake than the retirement benefits of one man.

The U.S. military has sought legal action against its own retirees only in a rare few cases—and those cases have typically involved egregious crimes, such as sexual assault. And although the military can prosecute sitting service members for prohibited speech—to make sure troops stay in line and follow orders, the military has strict rules prohibiting them from insulting public officials or making statements that undermine “good order and discipline”—several former military lawyers told me that no cases have previously been brought against a military retiree for something said after they hung up their uniform. “It’s important for the public to understand the extraordinary power that the administration is asking the courts to bless,” Ryan Goodman, a former Pentagon lawyer who teaches at the NYU School of Law, told me.

If the government prevails against Kelly, it will establish a precedent for punishing retirees for statements perceived as out of line by whoever is in charge at the time. (The Trump administration denies that this case has any First Amendment issues to consider, saying that even as a retiree, Kelly has no right to undermine military discipline by encouraging others to question orders.)

Even before the Kelly episode, I had heard from numerous veterans about the chilling effect that Hegseth has had. The defense secretary—who insists on being called the “war secretary”—has used social media and speeches to vilify opponents, including former service members. Those who have worn the uniform are now less likely to criticize the administration’s policy or personnel moves, because they fear for their benefits or worry about getting in hot water with current employers skittish about backlash from the administration.

During his first term, Trump mused about bringing senior officers whom he disliked, including Stanley McChrystal and William McRaven, back onto active duty and court-martialing them, but Pentagon officials talked him out of it, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper wrote in his memoir. Trump once insinuated that retired General Mark Milley, who served as his second chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should be executed. Shortly after taking office, Hegseth stripped Milley of his security detail.

Expanding the military’s ability to control veterans’ speech would be a major and historic reversal of basic freedoms. Retired service members turned public officials have a long history of criticizing Pentagon leaders in ways those leaders might find objectionable. Dwight D. Eisenhower famously warned Americans about the corruption that would come from the unchecked growth of the military-industrial complex, focusing on the power of the people in mitigating “the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power” that would “endanger our liberties or democratic processes.” John F. Kennedy beat back the A bomb–loving generals he believed were as dangerous as Nikita Khrushchev. Veterans have often been some of the harshest (and most clear-eyed) analysts of the military’s shortcomings.

I was thinking about this history as I watched Kelly stand at attention when Judge Leon entered the courtroom on Tuesday, a combat veteran who was doing just as new recruits are taught: holding his spine ramrod straight, fists curled back, thumbs aligned with the seam of the pants.

Leon, who kept his eyebrows positioned in a skeptical V for much of the hearing, seemed to be focused on that history too. How are veterans on Congress’s Armed Services Committees, he asked, supposed to do their job if they can’t criticize the military without fear of prosecution? Leon was visibly wary of the government’s arguments, at times tipping into what appeared to be barely contained bewilderment. At one point, when the Justice Department attorney John Bailey conceded that there were “a few unique things” about the government’s First Amendment–related claims, Leon barked back, “You think?”

Dan Maurer, a former Army lawyer and combat engineer, told me that Hegseth’s decision to pursue administrative disciplinary steps against Kelly—rather than an attempt to court-martial him—was likely because a trial would leave Kelly’s fate to a military jury. When I asked whether such a jury would convict Kelly, he laughed dismissively. “Absolutely not,” he said. Maurer, who teaches law at Ohio Northern University, said he believes that the administration’s objective is more about demonstrating punitive action and appealing to the base than winning in court. “They don’t care what the courts say, because they’re going to depict them as liberal, woke courts,” he said. (Judge Leon was appointed by George W. Bush.)

Tim Parlatore, Hegseth’s personal lawyer who now serves as an adviser in his office, suggested that the Pentagon might not pursue a criminal case against Kelly, because doing so would require him to be called back to active duty in the executive branch. This would effectively remove Kelly from his Senate seat and force litigation. “The Constitution prohibits somebody from holding office in two branches at the same time,” he told the Trump ally and Joseph McCarthy enthusiast Laura Loomer in December.

This brings up a second way that Hegseth’s orders would expand Pentagon leaders’ powers over military retirees. According to Maurer, who signed a letter from a group of retired military lawyers expressing concern about the actions against Kelly, the administrative procedure for reviewing and possibly reducing a retiree’s rank and pay has never been understood to apply to actions that occur after retirement.

Hegseth, who did not attend the hearing, has long expressed his disdain for the military justice system, advocating for lenient treatment of troops convicted of war crimes and deriding judge advocate generals, or JAGs, as pencil-necked “jagoffs.” The Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson said in an emailed statement that can only be interpreted as a non sequitur that Hegseth and his team would “do everything in our power to stop those who seek to harm Americans and the brave men and women defending our Homeland.”

But the government’s lawyer seemed to stumble at times, struggling to defend Hegseth’s actions. Leon noted that the cases the government had cited as precedent weren’t a perfect fit; they were either First Amendment cases involving currently serving troops or cases about other kinds of crimes involving retired military personnel. (Bailey argued that they were relevant because retirees can be recalled to active duty to be court-martialed.) Bailey asserted that retiree speech could still undermine good order and discipline, and denied that Hegseth’s actions would extend the reach of the military’s punitive powers over retirees. (“I know you don’t view it that way, but that’s what you’re doing,” Leon responded.)

Kelly’s attorney, Benjamin Mizer, urged the judge to shut down the Navy’s review because Hegseth’s public statements had put his thumb on the scales. “He’s not a decision maker who has kept an open mind,” Mizer told Leon. Federal courts have had a history of deferring to the military on national-security matters. Leon will issue a decision by Wednesday.

If the government prevails, the silencing of longtime service members would be like barring retired doctors from opining on health policy, Maurer said. When debating matters of war and peace, he said, it serves the public to hear from the very people who have served on the front lines—and lived through the consequences.</div>

            <h2>‘Not American Enough’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/spanish-latino-identity-immigration-trump/685904/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Veronica was born in California into a family with roots in Mexico. She flies the American flag outside her home on national holidays, and proudly belts out “The Star-Spangled Banner” with her hand over her heart at sporting events. Sitting in the bleachers at her son’s baseball game last month, Veronica started chatting with another mom in Spanish. Then she stopped and looked around, wondering if other parents might suspect that the women were undocumented and report them to immigration authorities. Is this going to get me in trouble? she recalled thinking.

Veronica’s concern has only deepened. Two weeks ago, after watching immigration agents arrest and kill U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, she talked with her 14-year-old son about how he should behave if law enforcement asked whether he was in the country legally. If it happened when they were together, she told him, agents would be more likely to focus on her because of her darker complexion. “I’m a U.S. citizen,” she reminded him. “You’re going to see me again.”

Similar conversations are taking place around the country in group chats, classrooms, churches, and at dinner tables among American-born Latinos who feel powerless amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They are scared of being detained or mistakenly deported, and are contending with their identity and place in a country whose highest court has given permission to agents to use a person’s race, ethnicity, or accent as a factor in immigration stops.

About two-thirds of U.S.-born Latinos told the Pew Research Center that they feel their situation has worsened over the past year; nearly half of those queried said they feel less safe in their area because of the mass-deportation blitz. Those I spoke with (all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity or allowed only their first name to be used because they fear retribution) said they are changing their habits. They carry photos of their birth certificate or passport and have saved lawyers’ numbers in their phones. They’re sharing videos of Americans being stopped by authorities and are being tipped off about immigration raids by friends and clients. School administrators are preparing for immigration-enforcement operations at pickup and drop-off. One woman told me that her son came home from school upset because he had a Spanish first name. He asked why he wasn’t given an English-sounding name, like his brother.

Many say they are offended that their legal status, and by extension, their patriotism, could be questioned. Gina Hinojosa, a Democratic state representative from Texas who was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley and is running for governor, said that everywhere she goes, Latino voters tell her they are insulted by the way the mass-deportation blitz has been carried out. “We love our country; we feel just as American as anyone, because we are,” she told me. “To be treated as not American enough, not Texan enough, is just a slap in the face.”

In Phoenix, where I live and where 42 percent of the population identifies as Latino, people have distinct memories of the last time immigration-enforcement operations were carried out this aggressively. Then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio had his deputies flood heavily Latino neighborhoods about 18 years ago, stopping and detaining people suspected of being in the country illegally. The sweeps, followed by a 2010 state law that was intended to crack down on undocumented immigrants, caused pervasive fear, not just among people who were in the country unlawfully.

The Trump administration’s mass-deportation campaign has now put much of the sprawling metropolis on edge, including residents who are American citizens. When an entourage of ICE vehicles was spotted at a park where youth-sports practices take place, word quickly spread on a neighborhood social-media page and in family texts: Stay away from the park. One 27-year-old who works in financial services told me he changed the route he drives to work to avoid ICE-marked SUVs. A small-business owner worries that her citizenship might be stripped because her mother came to the U.S. unlawfully. One prominent local restaurateur, whose family’s history in this country spans generations, told me he now lives with an undercurrent of anxiety, especially when his family travels through places that might have immigration checkpoints or when he gets close to the U.S.-Mexico border. “I’m the darkest one in my family,” he said. “I always turn down the music, I’m always very serious when we cross borders.” His wife and children have made fun of him. “You guys don’t understand,” he told them.

Students are particularly affected, their parents and educators told me; some have asked whether college scholarships could be rescinded because of their ethnicity, and some now prefer remote learning because of the possibility of raids. Robert is a dark-skinned 17-year-old who plays soccer, is learning Spanish, and gets good grades. His great-great-great-grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico in the late 1890s; Robert was born in Arizona. But he told me he’s started thinking that other people don’t believe he belongs in the U.S. He hears the demeaning words some classmates use when talking about politics, and said he often feels hostility from others because of the color of his skin.

He recently dug up a picture of his passport to have at the ready in case authorities demand to know where he was born. His parents warned him to stay under the speed limit to avoid drawing attention from police. Robert said he has drifted away from friends who have said they support Trump’s immigration policies.

“All of this stuff brought me to the question of: Am I proud to be an American?” he said. If he were to leave the U.S., he wondered, where would he go? “Do I want to be called an American? Is that a source of pride or is that a source of shame?” He isn’t sure.

A man who served in the military, and whose 26-year-old daughter, born in Germany, has dual citizenship, told me she recently asked whether she could be deported. Although his family has been in the U.S. for more than 100 years, he didn’t know what to say. “They’re doing lots of crazy stuff,” he told her. “I don’t know what could happen.” She asked him for help getting a U.S. passport, and he agreed. Before hanging up the phone, he told his daughter that he should be her first call if she ever ran into trouble with immigration authorities.

Stoking helplessness and fear may be part of the point of Trump’s crackdowns and rhetoric, experts who study cultural identity and politics told me. The administration’s tactics send a message about who belongs in the country, “who is morally worthy, and who is not,” Tomás R. Jiménez, a sociology professor at Stanford University, told me.

The alienation that message creates—particularly in combination with extreme partisanship—has the potential to reshape the way Americans interact with their neighbors, schools, employers, churches, and democratic institutions. Politically, it could threaten gains made by Trump and the Republican Party among Latino voters, who helped return him to the White House. Latino voters—like most people—want to feel like they are getting ahead economically, but recent polling shows that they feel like Trump and Republicans haven’t kept their promises to lower prices. In a special election in Texas this month, a Democrat won a state-Senate seat in a deep-red district that Trump won by 17 points in 2024, a shift powered by Latino voters turned off by Trump’s immigration operations and their economic situations. Even when Arizona was reliably red, it placed limits on hard-line immigration enforcement. Arpaio’s efforts in the early 2000s, followed by the state law, activated a generation of young Latinos who helped oust Arpaio in 2016, even as Trump won Arizona.

Electoral defeat could await Republicans who don’t distance themselves from Trump’s immigration raids, Richard Herrera, a professor emeritus of political science at Arizona State University, told me. “When people feel betrayed or feel abandoned,” he said, “they’re more likely to look for alternatives.”

The many people I spoke with told me the scenes from Minneapolis have made them feel more civically connected, because their rightful place in their country is at stake. After a popular chain of restaurants in Maricopa County was raided by immigration agents late last month, the teenagers of several parents I spoke with joined thousands of other high schoolers in and around Phoenix to march out of school. They will soon be old enough to vote. Among them was Veronica’s son.</div>

To mitigate tort liability and preserve financial partnerships.

Reducing legal exposure and looking good for their business partners.

Once they went corporate, it was only a matter of time.

after death there are no more issues to solve also, what&#39;s your point?

Because they want to collect all your ID data.

Most probably you are correct. I just killed my discord profiles.

Some service have found funny to impose a phone number verification to register. I did not make an account there. That is not negotiable. This why i don&#39;t use chat GPT.

If Discord becomes too annoying to use without an ID i will get out of it. Helen Lovejoys be damned.

They can censor my Discord experience. All I do on it do tabletop RPGs, as long as I can voice chat I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll care.

For people that do care. There are alternatives to Discord and they&#39;re going to go there. Hopefully Discord has a good idea of how many users they will have to give up for this, and have hopefully crunched the numbers before deciding if it was worth adding these restrictions.

Your kids donâ(TM)t need to do the verification if they arenâ(TM)t adults.  Kids can continue to use at the appropriate teen and below level without verification.Any other non problems to solve?

I think Roblox is facing the opposite problem:  They are under pressure to make sure adults don&#39;t impersonate kids.

>Also no way am I letting my kids scan their faces or upload IP to random companies just to use their services.

No face?  No problem, Discord will treat you like a teenager and keep you from seeing material they deem inappropriate for teens.

For the last couple years, the male subset of my children&#39;s church youth group used Discord for coordinating activities, and I learned about my daughter&#39;s activity plans via email.  As of last month, both subsets are moving to WhatsApp.  I&#39;m not sure if this particular change is &quot;too little, too late&quot; to have kept them, or if indeed it drives some of the youth and their parents away faster.

What&#39;s your church group posting about that it&#39;s likely to be flagged as an age-restricted community??

In all seriousness, my guess would be that this makes Discord more appealing to groups like you describe.  If Discord ends up with the reputation of a place where kids can get access all sorts of inappropriate content, I imagine parents being skeptical of letting their kids make an account at all.  With age restrictions/verification in place some of those fears may be mitigated (even with all the typical

Here&#39;s tradeoff I would accept, although may would understandably find it unacceptable:

I pay a notary public the usual fee - way under $10 where I live - to sign a statement saying that Discord user [my username] was born on or before a specified date [18 years ago, 21 years ago, whatever].

Yes, the notary will have records that are accessible by court order, but it&#39;s unlikely that those records will be online/hackable.
  Discord won&#39;t have anything more than the notary&#39;s name and licensing information.

My financial institution, a credit unit, does notary services for free. Just sayin ;) Something worth looking into!

...this kind of scheme would workThere are so many workarounds for those who refuse to complyThere are so many potential bugs and failure modes for those who try to follow the procedure and get rejected

Discord should offer a product to IT consulting firms and to large organizations:

Offer their technology, for the consulting firms and organizations to host and manage themselves.

This pushes many of the management and legal-compliance headaches to the IT firms and large organizations, while providing large sources of continuing, stable revenue.

Discord is about 10 years old now, so it canâ(TM)t quite come up yet that it would have accounts in use for 16 years. Still leaves the question about would this policy apply in such a case? If it does, that seems like it might imply Discord is treating the account as being used by someone other than the original owner. Which also raises questions.

70 hour weeks, for at least a short run, there is nothing wrong with this IF....you get paid properly.

I&#39;d do this if I were doing it 1099 with good negotiated contractor bill rate....I expect to get paid for every hour I work.

I would also jump at this if I were younger....when you are more bullet proof and can do the long hours thing without much problem....

Now would I want to do this for salary and long term, no....but often that old saying &quot;make hay while the sun

I too would not do this in my position / age now but socking away several hundred $K early-career in the market can give somebody a tremendous leg up after a few decades of compounding.

Yeah, when I was in my 20s I usually stayed in the office hours later than anyone else just to see what was going on, had no life outside of work to pull me away. In my 30s, though, fuck that shit. I have things to do. And 9AM-9PM is a terrrible time range. Your entire day is destroyed. Nothing is open early enough to get shit done before 9AM and everything else is closed by the time you get off. 6AM-6PM would be better, but the Jesus freaks would go nuts over calling it a &quot;666&quot; schedule.

And let&#39;s face it - if we&#39;re talking about working 70-80 hours a week for a year or two in order to have a damn good shot at walking away fabulously wealthy, that&#39;s a pretty good deal.

founders believe longer hours buy them a competitive edge.This is such nonsense. Overtime works for incidental cases, not structurally. If you work one or two days overtime, it might help with completing a job that could otherwise not be done. After that, the productivity falls back to normal due to fatigue creeping in. After a week, a 70 our week is as productive as a 40 hour one, at best.

As someone who has worked in numerous startups, I will say:  Bullshit.

In the &#39;90s, when provided with stock options, a good chance the company would IPO, or be bought out, a high salary, and other perks, yes, it may be worth it.  For yet another AI startup that will be long forgotten when the market closes, not really.

Plus, there is fatigue and burnout.  An IT group I was in did 100 hour work weeks during an outage, then realized the MSP was full of shit, and management actually wanted to cause outages so p

Don&#39;t expect to be able to shop or visit many attractions in your average french town between 12 and 2/3pm, they&#39;ve all buggered off home for lunch. Which also leads to the interesting phenomenon of 4 rush hours per day.

While it is different from the norm you are overstating it by a factor of 2. The typical Chinese lunch break is around 1.5-2 hours. But yes napping is something culturally significant there over lunch.

That said this isn&#39;t unique. Many parts of France, Italy, and definitely Spain have extended lunch breaks as a norm as well, Spain culturally so.

I&#39;ve worked, at least tangentially, with IT folk from various cultures. The 996 is for sweatshop work. I remember one place where people sat at their desks entering code, or whatever. Walking around behind them was the boss, who would go from person to person, telling them *exactly* what to do. All the way down to telling one person to put a CD back into its case. The people were barely even code monkeys - more like typists. Probably you can do that 996 without losing productivity. No idea how the boss functioned. Maybe he swapped out with someone else?

When I was studying for my first master&#39;s degree, there was a brief time where I had coursework as well as my thesis. To get everything done, I worked highly structured 80 hour weeks. That was only possible, because it was only for a few weeks - there was an end in sight. That sort of schedule cannot be maintained. Anyone who thinks it can be is spending a lot of time staring into space / talking at the water cooler / something else non-productive.

Nah, probably just the usual monomanical autists who don&#39;t have an existence beyond their monitor screen and assume everyone else is the same. They probably wouldn&#39;t recognise a social life if they tripped over one.

I&#39;ve done it before. Bills to pay. Ambition. Greed. Optimism. There are lots of reasons to do this.

The worst one I did 7am-7pm, 6 days a week. Then half day (6 hours) on Sunday. Felt pretty burned out after 4 months of that.

Correction, should be 71th hour. Or do I round up? Mixing math and English is too hard a problem for a Monday.

If this is in the US, how is this kind of thing even legal?Although, I suppose being that it&#39;s a desk job, I doubt OSHA would get involved.  As long as they pay OT rates for anything over 40 hours, they wouldn&#39;t break DoL rules.But, with minimum-wage being what it is now, the company will go broke in no time flat.

develop severe insomnia.12-hours home for six days, then 1 full day off... for those six days, that&#39;s barely enough to unwind, maybe have a few beers or couple drinks, shower, eat dinner (or cook it if you live alone), and get to bed for a decent night&#39;s sleep... and that full-day off is gonna throw off your whole schedule.Insomnia sucks... I developed it while working third shift at Electrolux (I was foam head operator)... 11PM Sunday to 7AM Monday, five days a week, Saturday was the only day fully off (when it wasn&#39;t mandatory OT) which became grocery day, and Sunday would be laundry day... the whiplash from having Saturday off to flipping back to regular schedule resulted in me developing primary insomnia (working there ended in 2012, I still have it to this day... up to 80mg Trazodone nightly).

How the hell are you supposed to have a family life (or any life at all) working like that?  Or, is it just &#39;sign your life over to the company, and only exist for the company&#39; until they wheel your corpse out?

...my brain turned to spaghetti when I worked long hours. It might work good enough to finish periodic deadlines that require dotting i&#39;s and crossing t&#39;s, but general quality becomes wobbly.

Of course, everyone is different, but on average those who work long hours start to look and act funny by my observation.

If the employees are being paid for every hour they work or have stock to make up the difference, sure, maybe long weeks make sense.

But volunteering free labor so someone else can be rich is pretty foolish.

No really in this case it&#39;s true. Labour regulations limit the maximum work hours to 60h / week only on exception and the average working week needs to be 48h over any given 6 month period. Some regions limit this to a lower point such as 52hours unless there&#39;s a government exception granted to the business (e.g. on an industrial plant during maintenance downtime window). But that is compensated with additional leave afterwards.

Where I live (not Germany) a business will get a fine if employees are found wor

so some C-suite can earn a billions extra than another company? If people were smart they&#39;d strike together. People aren&#39;t that smart.

Remind me of the second foundation book (foundation and empire), where &quot;the mule&quot; used psionic habilities to enhance the intellect of certain subjects, and made them work themselves to death on intellectual ventures by burning the candle on both ends...

I know is nothing very relevant, I just wanted to say it.

This is where the bullshit about &quot;return to office&quot; is truly revealed. If they wanted people to put in the hours, they would be all for it. I&#39;ve been working 100% remote now for 4 years, and when I&#39;m working on something that is very involved and demands time, I put in 16+ hours a day because of how accessible the workspace is, and I enjoy it the actual work. But the flexible schedule of being remote still lets me get my &quot;me time&quot;, and I&#39;d never do that if I was commuting to an office.

Wait, we were assured that AI makes our work more efficient, and that means we should work fewer hours. Shouldn&#39;t the AI companies, the ones on the leading edge of the AI revolution, be the first to show these advantages?

Well, at least I assume that they are going to base the salary on 72 hours per week, including time-and-a-half for overtime? They&#39;re not just using this as a way to get more work for the same pay, right?

While I was working at Ameritech in the mid-nineties, I had one week I broke 70 hours. Around that time, my late wife was semi-serious about suing Ameritech for alienation of affection.

FUCK THIS SHIT. You want to be an indentured servant?

Once you leave it won&#39;t be your problem if management have been short sighted with the training and the company tanks. Most people don&#39;t stay at companies more than a few years now anyway as its been demonstrated many times in the last decade or so that people are norhing more than &quot;resources&quot; like paperclips to most companies, to be disposed off when profits dip.

I understand how all the parts work together, while most are focused on the piece they work on. I am constantly reminding upper management that I need to train people. People keep coming and going, learn then leave. And no one reads documentation, so that&#39;s not an option. They&#39;re all good people, and I&#39;m sure they will handle it when I&#39;m gone. We are constantly working on modernizing, which is great! Just need to make sure that they don&#39;t forget important parts.

Start now and incorporate yourself. LLC or as I prefer a S-Corp.

Then when you retire, and they inevitably get lost and try to contact you...be ready to consult back to them 1099 at a few hundred dollars and hour bill rate.

This way, you&#39;ll get some good pocket money, they won&#39;t go down the drain AND if the bill rate is high enough they won&#39;t bother you for piddly shit....

In my 50s, I was unceremoniously shoved aside. I had no voice or input via an involuntary transfer due to a fundamental lack of understanding about the scope and breadth of my work. I continued to warn them of the entirely predictable consequences of doing so. My new boss was awesome unlike my abusive former boss(es). Things began to blow up at the old duty station, despite documentation, instructions, and warnings. My new boss refused to make me available to my old duty station.

Fuck it, retire. No longer you problem if the company folds due to mismanagement.

They don&#39;t *need* to justify it. They just do it, probably mostly reflexively now. It&#39;s not like they are going to get sued because they would never say &quot;age&quot; is the reason they aren&#39;t hiring someone.

This is so true! I pointed out the silliness with sticking microservices on non-web-scale projects with relatively small teams, but was ignored because the new young &quot;architect&quot; knew all the buzzwords, claiming it created magic Lego-like modularity (despite the fact it was poorly documented and the seams were difficult to deb

There are two main drivers of age bias:



1) The conscious, economic one.  

Experienced workers cost more. While experience can generate efficiency gains, those gains rarely show up on a balance sheet after the first year. The loss of that institutional knowledge only becomes visible later—often when organizations end up rebuilding or reinstalling the very systems they dismantled. It&#39;s simple...pay more and get more?....good deal.  Pay more and get less?....bad deal.  If you&#39;re well paid, you need to deliver.  You can&#39;t do the same output you did when you were 25 and 1/3 the cost.  You have to produce higher quality work.  I&#39;m old AF myself.  I am aware that I need to not only deliver high quality, but be someone they can rely on.  My peers who chose to coast on their experience and not take schedules seriously?...they were laid off in the last round of layoffs.   Just because you&#39;re

My observation is that the population groups are different between young and old workers.

It&#39;s not that individual older workers are more productive in any way, but rather that the young cohort contains all the people who will become drunks, drug users, who bring their sex problems to works, who steal and so on.The young people who are not fucked up are often amazing, but the worthless ones cause more problems and bring others down, so on the average productivity is damaged.The worthless old ones who have jo

We&#39;ve seen and heard all the BS and veiled threats from various pointy hairs over the decades and its water off a ducks back. They can&#39;t handle that, particularly if they&#39;re young with large egos.

A lot of it is simply increased economic power. If you are 60 years old, you are hopefully pretty close to financially being able to retire (especially if you have had a decent corporate gig for a long time). If they fire you, it just means early retirement with maybe a few less-plush vacations. If you are 30 years old, you are probably six months from having to move in with your parents if you get fired. It&#39;s a lot harder to scare someone who is financially independent with financial consequences than some

Or maybe even day-tur if you enjoy intrusive rhotacism.

You&#39;ve had ten more years to watch and learn. It&#39;s not generational. It&#39;s just how people are and how our perceptions of one another change as we age. I see plenty of lazy shits at every age bracket and hard workers at every age bracket. All in the same building.

The general practise now that &quot;Human Resources&quot; runs the world seems to be to deskill the work as much as possible so people become interchangeable cogs.

That also means your organization goes to shit because no-one knows anything but at least they don&#39;t have to worry about &quot;Bob The Guy Who Knows Everything&quot; getting hit by a bus.

When I started out on a new job, doing FAA certification work for aircraft systems, as soon as I figured out that it was mostly bullshit work to keep the regulators snowed, they moved me aside (same company, different job).

The folks they&#39;re forcing out are the ones who have higher salaries. Oh, but they&#39;ll replace them with AI, right? They won&#39;t need people with experience, *or* people with no experience!! /a

They say no performance impact, presumably meaning compute performance. But what about power efficiency performance?

It&#39;s LPDDR4 RAM. Having a second chip is insignificant, an entire SODIMM typically uses 300mW of power and usually has 8 of these things on them.

if the RPi4 had per-chip power gating, you could potentially have better power savings. But it doesn&#39;t, and the amount you&#39;d save from power gating versus PASR on LPDDR is pretty small. I think pi4/5 still don&#39;t support self-refresh or suspend-to-ram, but the hardware should be capable when the firmware and kernel are ready for it.

Frankly. Raspberry Pi was never aimed at being ultra lower power. It&#39;s aimed at a price for a mostly open and programmable platform that is accessible to hobbyists.

Recycling was a lot easier when RAM was on SIMMs and DIMMS (and socketed DIPs for the old-timers).

Unlikely that it would be compatible. You would need a reflow oven and xray machine at the minimum.

I wonder if anyone made a magnetic core memory module for the Pi? Core memory [core64.io] for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Core memory [core64.io] for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Everspin sells MRAM (Magnetoresistive RAM). I think in up to 8MB sizes. But I think it only offers I2C and SPI as the interfaces, so not very friendly for running your entire Pi on it. But could make for a rather handy non-volatile storage.

The ZX81 is an even better example. Officially it was a four chip solution - ULA, CPU, RAM, and ROM. This was announced at release and heavily advertised (part of the appeal was you could buy it in kit form and put it together with minimal soldering.) In practice multiple models, for the same reason, came with two half-kilobyte RAM chips instead of a single kilobyte chip, because Uncle Clive found it was easier to source them.

Get an Orange Pi, for example. Designed by people with some actual understanding of hardware, not the clowns that designed the RP. Typically cheaper, more options, etc.

The Pi folks fuck up bigly on approximately every design. I&#39;ve been watching casually since I had the raspi model A with the shitfest USB that all the fanboy clowns defended to the death even though it made the device completely worthless for any USB traffic heavy applications. They especially half-ass the power supply section of the board almost every time, which is very very bad since if that doesn&#39;t work right, nothing else does either.

And yet the RPi still sell very well after all these years...

The purpose of the RPi was not to build pocketable super computers, it was to introduce a new generation of students to a computing experience akin to the late 70s and 80s, Apple, Tandy, Commodore, etc, as well as encourage harware mods like leds, relays, and sensors.

The original designs were based on cellphone chips, which oddly lacked things like Ethernet, so yes, early designs were not optimal, but they were functional.

Bingo. It was a product designed to be made as cheaply as possible.

And yet the RPi still sell very well after all these years...Consumer ignorance is always a good bet.

Indeed. That is why you can make tons of money with inferior products. You just need to find enough idiots that cannot tell the difference.

An 8088? Seriously? A kludgy, ugly, CPU from an era where it was expensive to add pins to chips resulting in weird multiplexed buses, and an ISA only a motherboard designer could love*?

This would be better than a RISC CPU why?

And this is being proposed because... the bootloader on the Pi is complicated? Why not just propose simplifying the bootloader? Or a minor architectural change that&#39;ll result in a simplified bootloader for specific tasks, such as using an EEPROM for the firmware?

There&#39;s a ton of value in broad availability of supply, huge support and peripheral ecosystem and so on.

If I need to squeeze performance on a budget, then sure. But for many cases the RasPi is fine, and the time spent not faffing around with niche hardware greatly outweighs the few tens of dollars of extra cost for the Pi.

There&#39;s a ton of value in broad availability of supply, huge support and peripheral ecosystem and so on.I suppose it depends what you&#39;re going to do with it.  If you&#39;re going to make and market an industrial controller, or a networked bathroom snitch puck, and require (moderately) guaranteed-stable-and-available hardware that you can vibe code in Python, Pi is a good solution.

I should follow this up with the addendum that the RPi folks hit it out of the park with the Pi Pico.

Custom silicon rather than taking a shitty SOC and drawing a smiley face on it, features no one else has (mainly the PIO blocks), and a price point so good that no one&#39;s really going to bother knocking it off (there are clone boards, but they all seem to use the RP chip).

Different market, but a full embrace of the DIY maker ethos that RPi started with.

&quot;Better&quot; requires you to define your requirements. All Orange Pi models come at a considerable price disadvantage compared to RPis. So already it is a failure for the requirements of many people, those who already consider the RPi 4 to be too expensive.

Please stop suggesting solutions to people without even asking what the problem is.

As to your complaints, there&#39;s been one major screwup and that was the power design on the original Pi. Everything else is a tradeoff. The original RPi had a perfectly find USB

The original RPi had a perfectly find USB interface for many of the applications it was designed forWhere &quot;applications it was designed for&quot; means &quot;things I used it for without problem&quot;.If it doesn&#39;t suit your needs and you bought it, then you are the person who has no clue.No, that&#39;s not how this works.Next time spend more and buy a device commensurate with your project requirements.I do agree with you on this point.
With the Pi, you 100% get what you pay for.There&#39;s a reason the RPi was a success despite your assertion that the people don&#39;t understand hardware (and it&#39;s easy to be a criticising arse of a keyboard warrior when you never tried designing such a system yourself)Ah, yes.

Thankfully one already exists on the far side of the moon.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

Nazi base? One exists at Mar-a-Lago, don&#39;t need to visit the stinkin&#39; moon to get one&#39;s fascist rocks off.

And it sounds like Musk is TACOing Mars now. He used to not shuddup about Mars. Now he&#39;s a Moonie.

Musk has no clue and he is not an engineer. Even only keeping out the Regolith dust (which will be survival critical) will take longer to figure out than those &quot;10 years&quot;.

Nobody thinks he&#39;s doing all the work.But we all see he&#39;s constantly making up bullshit without verifying it the people that are supposed to implement it because he&#39;s perpetually desperate for attention, and needs to keep promising new bullshit to keep the stock prices high.

We&#39;ve all got first-hand knowledge of that because he keeps saying and doing things in public that confirm it. We don&#39;t need to have direct access to someone&#39;s inner mind to make reasonable inferences about their motivations. It&#39;s a completely normal thing to do, and you do it all the time, because humans can&#39;t function without it.

Indeed. And maybe the engineers will come up with a breakthrough in some area of tech but if not - well its keeping a lot of highly educated people gainfully employed and if Musk wants to spend his - or more likely some gullible investors - money on their wages then he should be allowed to carry on doing it.

Musk has been making bad predictions for decades now. Boots on Mars in 10 years, about 15 years ago now. Full self driving in 6 months, a decade ago. Starship was supposed to be flying regular missions by now, the new Roadster should have been delivered years ago (with booster rockets, according to Elon).

And the new roadster is hardly pushing the engineering boat out either in 2026 , its easily doable with current tech as other companies are proving, so one can only assume he&#39;s lost interest in it.

There&#39;s a huge difference between NASA making plans that encounter delays, and Elon pulling dates out of his ass.

Starship was supposed to be flying regular missions by now, the new Roadster should have been delivered years ago (with booster rockets, according to Elon).Indeed, check out Youtube videos of actual physicists peeing all over the plan to send humans to Mars. I particularly like the one from Leonard Susskind, physicist at Sanford. He lists a number of problems for which Elmo and the rest of the space nutters have no answer. The chief problem is radiation. It turns out the Universe hates us and is constantly trying to kill us off with radiation; and if it weren&#39;t for the atmosphere and magnetic field of Earth, it would have succeeded. And cosmic radiation is the really nasty sort, much worse than the Sun&#39;s. Speaking of the Sun, it hates us as well. It periodically sends out plums of radiation. Catch one of those while coasting along in your tin can and you can feel like shrimp on the barbie. Shielding could help, several meters of water around the crew quarters, although this feeds into the next problem. And you&#39;ll be wanting that shielding on Mars.Another issue is the rocket equation. It can predict how much fuel you&#39;ll be wanting. Sure you can ferry stuff up to Earth orbit, but you must still accelerate it to Mars and decelerate once you get close. Our rockets are very inefficient. And you&#39;ll be needing a lot of fuel, which must also be to accelerated and decelerated. And do not forget the return trip, any humans you send will probably want to come back.Then there is the problem that our bodies are built for 1g around Earth. Get them into space for any extended length of time and your muscles atrophy, including your heart muscle. You can try to exercise but it won&#39;t be enough and any time you spend exercising is less time you have to do anything. Spending 2.5 years on a mission means that Earth&#39;s gravity will probably kill you if you make it back because your heart won&#39;t be able pump like it remembers in its youth. You now have the heart of a 110 yr. old.Air. The Earth has relatively lots of it. Mars has very little of it, less than 1% of Earth&#39;s.Food: You cannot bring enough for the 2+ years a mission would take. Once you manage to catch that little bugger Mars in its orbit and want to come back, you cannot until at least another year goes by. Its funny but the Earth and Mars move in their orbits while you weren&#39;t paying attention.There are also other issues.

Food: You cannot bring enough for the 2+ years a mission would take. Once you manage to catch that little bugger Mars in its orbit and want to come back, you cannot until at least another year goes by. Its funny but the Earth and Mars move in their orbits while you weren&#39;t paying attention.

He just seems to consistently and vastly underestimate the difficulty of engineering these things. He seems to have thought that Starship was just a case of making a bigger rocket, a few years tops, and then unlimited tankers to orbit so Mars is &quot;easy&quot;.

AI is another massive blind spot for him. The original 6 months for full self driving seems to have been based on a misunderstanding of how AI works and how difficult image recognition it. Many of the fatalities caused by Tesla Autopilot are due to it simply

High resolution radar is great and really should be in any autonomous car*, but I disagree about conventional radar.  The resolution is so low that at any reasonable distance ahead of your car, it just can&#39;t tell if something is in your lane or not.

* - I like how it sees the world in a different manner than how your cameras do, so it&#39;s an entirely independent datastream not subject to the same limitations as your cameras, unlike LIDAR which has the same limitations, only worse. Metal shines brightly. People

I think for a driving aid, conventional radar is fine. It is enough to lessen the impact if something is in front of the car, and the driver is supposed to be paying attention anyway.

The reason why FSD is so dangerous is because it lulls the driver into a false sense of security. The time between disengagements increasing just makes it worse. At least they now have the interior camera to watch the driver, but there are a lot of them on the road that don&#39;t.

Um... I have issues with a lot that Elon says, but those are some pretty weak arguments.

Yes, we can, with today&#39;s tech, get people to Mars and back without them dying of radiation poisoning.  Not significantly increasing their lifetime risk of cancer is the challenge, not the question of whether you can keep them alive.  And the solutions aren&#39;t at all magical - you coast with your fuel and engines between your crew and the sun, and you ideally also have small shelters for solar storms. GCR can&#39;t be readily

It turns out the Universe hates us and is constantly trying to kill us off

It sent us the Orange Thing because there are no pending supernovas available in our vicinity, and God used up his locust supply in Egypt.

Musk has been making bad predictions for decades now. Boots on Mars in 10 years, about 15 years ago now. Full self driving in 6 months, a decade ago. Starship was supposed to be flying regular missions by now, the new Roadster should have been delivered years ago (with booster rockets, according to Elon).Musk&#39;s biggest issue, before the drugs and ketamine, was that he lived in some weird bubble of fantasy co-joined with an optimistic &quot;if we poured all our resources into it without any barriers or regulatory hurdles&quot; (which is its own fantasy) view of the world when it comes to the things he wants to achieve. He seemed to believe, even before the public meltdown stage, that he was such an authority on things that when he decided something should be the focus, the entire world should bend to his will to make

In November he updated the rocket roadster to a flying roadster that we would see demoed by the end of the year. That created a distraction for a few weeks.

I read a few accounts of this meeting to get a good picture of what happened and it is a whole lot of nothing. Musk was just gassing to investors in a meeting with his trademark vague &quot;visionary&quot; BS.

Rest assured, he will bring Mars up again in the not too distant future when he needs another distraction.

Though he is doing reusable, landing boosters, Falcon 9&#39;s. With boosters getting used a ton of times and making space more affordable for all.Yes, he (well, SpaceX) is doing that. And that&#39;s impressive. Damn impressive. But Musk still talked big and delivered late.He predicted a first landing of a booster in 2013-2014.

This speaks volumes about Musk&#39;s predictions. He said they were going to skip the moon to go to Mars, as all that &#39;research&#39; on the moon was pointless, and he wanted to &#39;back up&#39; the human race on Mars.

Now he says they&#39;re going to the moon instead. He also claims it&#39;ll take less than 10 years.

I suspect in humankind collectively decided to build a city on the moon in 10 years, we could probably do it. Musk&#39;s companies are all buying each other to hide losses - but by any measure they&#39;re bigger than most comp

Human beings get unwell living in very low gravity for extended periods. The ISS showed that. Space cities need artificial gravity, such as spinning torus. A space city on the moon is nonsense.

The moon is about one sixth gravity and no-one has ever tried that long term

On the other hand, if 1/6th gravity does prove enough, that&#39;ll answer the big question hanging over whether Mars&#39;s 0,4g is enough.

If it doesn&#39;t, then it&#39;s still in the who-knows category.

Musk&#39;s companies are all buying each other to hide losses - but by any measure they&#39;re bigger than most companies, but still comparatively small on the &quot;nation state scale&quot;. it feels unlikely that even if he spent every last cent he could lay his hands on that he&#39;d be able to do what he says in 10 years.I suppose it depends on the size of the nations. Musk net worth, according to a DDG AI search and other countries GDP:As of 2025, Elon Musk&#39;s net worth is approximately $384 billion. Countries with GDPs lower than this amount include those with GDPs below $384 billion, such as countries like Greece and Portugal, which have GDPs around $300 billion and $250 billion, respectively.Now obviously we don&#39;t see those two countries or those with lower GDPs sending people to space, so maybe they don&#39;t count as &quot;real&quot; countries.

Come on, the fat ketamine Nazi has all the pieces of the puzzle.

Electric cars that need no air to combust - check.Tunnel-digging machinery that can create congestions - check.Spaceship that can also do fireworks - check.Robotaxis in the millions - check.An angry &quot;AI&quot; to throw rocks at Earth - check.

It is a done deal, basically, with blackjack and hookers.

I propose he goes first and stays. Then we will at least have one dead Moon-Nazi as a permanent installment up there to remind us of some things.

Nope. It gives you some hard surfaces, but the fine dust will still get everywhere and slowly kill people.

Aw, come on. Just wash it down with some water, same as nuclear safety decontamination procedures. It&#39;s a long-solved problem.

I cannot tell whether you are being really stupid or sarcastic.

Correct me if I am wrong, but don&#39;t microwaves heat things by exciting water? Does microwave radiation work on dry sand/dust?

Microwaves work on metal, too, or you wouldn&#39;t bet getting those sparks in a microwave, nor could you melt tin like some people do.

I&#39;m sure that powerful enough microwaves will interact with anything their wave can disturb and not go right through.

But you are right that rocks or lunar regolith are not things that microwaves work well on.

There actually is metal in lunar regolith, BTW.  About half a percent of it by mass is metallic iron. One ISRU proposal for mining on the moon is basically &quot;drive along and throw regolith across magnets, and melt down whatever sticks&quot; ;)

Try running the energy calculations on how much it&#39;ll take to pave the entire landscape around you.

(Also, lunar dust is mobile. No matter how far you pave out, it&#39;ll come back.  It gets ionized by solar radiation, lifts off, and drifts significant distances)

It took him longer than ten years to figure out human flight to ISS.

I know you&#39;re going to be a trillionaire soon, but damn. Your projections started out grandiose, but now they&#39;re just humorous. You blew past unreasonable so quickly we didn&#39;t even notice it.

It wouldn&#39;t work for &quot;securing the future of civilization,&quot; even if they were able to overcome the mountain of difficult and expensive engineering challenges.

Any sort of calamity that put human life on Earth in peril would mean the lunar colony would stop receiving support from Earth and would die off long before the last holdouts Earthside.

There&#39;s an incredibly long list of things they&#39;d need shipped up to survive, none of which are needed on Earth. Because on Earth you can survive by primitive means if necessary.

This isn&#39;t &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.  It is hard to make a moon colony self-sustaining.  Just the loss of core materials due to daily use have to be replenished from Earth, otherwise the colony will eventually become a tomb.

At the minimum, it will take multiple, redundant sources of iron and other materials, a source of oxygen, water (which means hydrogen, and there isn&#39;t much of that in the moon&#39;s atmosphere.)

It isn&#39;t just an engineering hurdle.  This is a resource hurdle and providing things that are already hard to get on earth, and already need extremely modern supply lines to make and get into a usable thing in the first place.

Instead, the best hope is trying to get mines up and go 100% robotic until we can get stuff piled in areas that are usable.  This combined with a cheaper propellant source because moving stuff out of Earth&#39;s gravity well isn&#39;t cheap.

Iron, oxygen and water are not hard things to acquire at the moon&#39;s poles.  It&#39;s like you were trying to make a list of the things that are easiest to acquire on the moon.

Your biggest problems will be the extreme paucity of both nitrogen and carbon, things essential en masse for all life. Beyond that, chlorine and fluorine are also very rare, zinc is about 2 orders of magnitude less common than on Earth (also lead, bismuth, thallium and cadmium), etc.  Also, beyond general abundances, is the lack of many of

A very fancy, very rich one, but a marketdroid with money to spend nonetheless. His skills are in bullshitting about maybes, pure and simple. Sometimes he gets it right with EVs and rockets, sometimes when he attempts to be a futurologist without understanding the engineering and biological issues he just sounds like an idiot. This is one of those times.

i always remember the impression he made on me when i first watched a Tesla keynote he did, years and years ago. I remember thinking to myself &quot;how can he be so shit at this compared to Jobs?&quot; I know Steve Jobs was a phenomenal presenter, but Musk was just such a *shit* presenter. I couldn&#39;t believe that other people thought he was good at it.

It will be built with fully autonomous self driving cars, but only with an upfront payment of 3Bn dollars.

It took him a while, but he finally seems to have found a sea [wikipedia.org] that is &quot;not too choppy&quot; [x.com] for a Cybertruck to drive across.

I remember the document &quot;Affordable, rapid bootstrapping of space industry and solarsystem civilization&quot;

https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.032... [arxiv.org]

A decade ago it was proposed about develop the Moon with the assistance of AI. It&#39;s not about human colonization. Not yet. And more about robot colonization.

I think it&#39;s a great idea. Low risk (human missions are a lot more expensive), finally develop local resources, with a fixed cost per time, develop an exponential infrastructure.

The thing is, this proposition was developed before AI revolution, so I think now has more sense than ever.

Once you industrialize the Moon, create an true near self-sustaining, redundant and growing outpost become a lot more easier and logical.

Don&#39;t start with human colonization. Let&#39;s focus on robot colonization (instead of exploration) now.And the Moon has lots of advantages in that regard. Relatively &quot;high&quot; gravity (in comparison with most rock bodies of the Solar System). Nearly real-time communication (just a pair of seconds apart). Some good metal reserves. Spots with near 24x7 light (in the poles, a bunch of solar groups of interconnected panels can reach that goal). Some ice to build fuel. A potential space elevator.

Not ideal for human colonization, but great for robot colonization, and we probably should start that way.Manned program requires elevate the security and will raise the cost too much.

Then there&#39;s the Kessler syndrome. Thanks to Elon and his ilk, we are well on our way to filling up an unregulated layer of space junk at the low earth orbital regions of space. When critical mas

By civilization Musk means himself and a tiny group of humans to entertain him.

People like to laugh at how ridiculous his predictions are.

Exactly. Buying Twitter was a financial disaster. His solution was to form xAI and use that money to buy Twitter and make the private investors &quot;whole&quot; so thry are happy. Now they are racing to cash out xAI investors before the bubble pops, so SpaceX &quot;buys&quot; it. SpaceX goes public, VCs make their big multiple, and then Musk fans just keep believing the hype. There is a famous saying that is the gist of Elon: &quot;the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent&quot;. Betting on Elon is a proxy for betting that people are irrational.

Self sustaining space colonies are the only way to escape earth&#39;s politics, and most importantly, the pull on the soul of the gravity.Also &quot;musk&quot; is a pretty dumb surname, i consider changing to something more nice, more space like, like &quot;Deikum&quot;

Also not related at all, but if you ever think on doing giant robots, consider only using only one big red eye, and giving em axes that heat up the edge. it will tell earth everything they need to know.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

Trump has called for elections to be “nationalized,” something neither the president, nor the federal government, has the authority to do. But as he’s already sent the FBI to raid Fulton County, Georgia’s election offices with director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and with the midterms on their way, it’s time to ask how much damage a vindictive president could do.

Guest:  Ari Berman, voting rights reporter at Mother Jones.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s a day with a name ending in Y, so you know what that means: Another OpenClaw cybersecurity disaster.

This time around, SecurityScorecard&#39;s STRIKE threat intelligence team is sounding the alarm over the sheer volume of internet-exposed OpenClaw instances it discovered, which numbers more than 135,000 as of this writing. When combined with previously known vulnerabilities in the vibe-coded AI assistant platform and links to prior breaches, STRIKE warns that there&#39;s a systemic security failure in the open-source AI agent space.

&quot;Our findings reveal a massive access and identity problem created by poorly secured automation at scale,&quot; the STRIKE team wrote in a report released Monday. &quot;Convenience-driven deployment, default settings, and weak access controls have turned powerful AI agents into high-value targets for attackers.&quot;

For those unfamiliar with the saga of Clawdbot, er Moltbot, no, wait, OpenClaw (it keeps changing names), it&#39;s an open-source, vibe-coded agentic AI platform that has been, frankly, an unmitigated disaster for those worried about security. OpenClaw&#39;s skill store, where users can find extensions for the bot, is riddled with malicious software. Three high-risk CVEs have been attributed to it in recent weeks, and it&#39;s also been reported that its various skills can be easily cracked and forced to spill API keys, credit card numbers, PII, and other data valuable to cybercriminals.

Take a bunch of those already vulnerable instances and give them free rein to access the internet, as STRIKE has discovered happening around the world, and those problems are quickly magnified.

STRIKE&#39;s summary of the problem doesn&#39;t even do it justice, as the number of identified vulnerable systems has skyrocketed on its live OpenClaw threat dashboard since publication several hours before our story.

Take the aforementioned 135,000+ internet-facing OpenClaw instances - that number is as of our writing; when STRIKE published its report earlier today, that number was at just over 40,000. STRIKE also mentioned 12,812 OpenClaw instances it discovered being vulnerable to an established and already patched remote code execution bug. As of this writing, the number of RCE-vulnerable instances has jumped to more than 50,000. The number of instances detected that were linked to previously reported breaches (not necessarily related) has also skyrocketed from 549 to over 53,000, as has the number of internet-facing OpenClaw instances associated with known threat actor IPs.

In other words, this is nothing short of a disaster in the making, all thanks to a suddenly-popular AI tool vibe-coded into existence with little regard to the safety of its codebase or users.

That&#39;s not to say users aren&#39;t at least partially to blame for the issue. Take the way OpenClaw&#39;s default network connection is configured.

&quot;Out of the box, OpenClaw binds to `0.0.0.0:18789`, meaning it listens on all network interfaces, including the public internet,&quot; STRIKE noted. &quot;For a tool this powerful, the default should be `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). It isn&#39;t.&quot;

STRIKE recommends all OpenClaw users, at the very least, immediately change that binding to point it to localhost. Outside of that, however, SecurityScorecard&#39;s VP of threat intelligence and research Jeremy Turner wants users to know that most of the flaws in the system aren&#39;t due to user inattention to defaults. He told The Register in an email that many of OpenClaw&#39;s problems are there by design because it&#39;s built to make system changes and expose additional services to the web by its nature.

&quot;It&#39;s like giving some random person access to your computer to help do tasks,&quot; Turner said. &quot;If you supervise and verify, it&#39;s a huge help. If you just walk away and tell them all future instructions will come via email or text message, they might follow instructions from anyone.&quot;

As STRIKE pointed out, compromising an OpenClaw instance means gaining access to everything the agent can access, be that a credential store, filesystem, messaging platform, web browser, or just its cache of personal details gathered about its user.

And with many of the exposed OpenClaw instances coming from organizational IP addresses and not just home systems, it&#39;s worth pointing out that this isn&#39;t just a problem for individuals mucking around with AI.

Turner warns that OpenClaw isn&#39;t to be trusted, especially in organizational contexts.

&quot;Consider carefully how you integrate this, and test in a virtual machine or separate system where you limit the data and access with careful consideration,&quot; Turner explained. &quot;Think of it like hiring a worker with a criminal history of identity theft who knows how to code well and might take instructions from anyone.&quot;

That said, Turner isn&#39;t advocating for individuals and organizations to completely abandon agentic AI like OpenClaw - he simply wants potential users to be wary and consider the risks when deploying a potentially revolutionary new tech product that&#39;s rife with vulnerabilities.

&quot;All these new capabilities are incredible, and the researchers deserve a lot of credit for democratizing access to these new technologies,&quot; Turner told us. &quot;Learn to swim before jumping in the ocean.&quot;

Or just stay out altogether - the ocean is terrifying. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/claude_opus_46_compiler/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An Anthropic researcher&#39;s efforts to get its newly released Opus 4.6 model to build a C compiler left him &quot;excited,&quot; &quot;concerned,&quot; and &quot;uneasy.&quot;

It also left many observers on GitHub skeptical, to say the least.

Nicholas Carlini, a researcher on Anthropic&#39;s Safeguards team, detailed the experiment with what he called &quot;agent teams&quot; in a blog that coincided with the official release of Opus 4.6.

He said he &quot;tasked 16 agents with writing a Rust-based C compiler, from scratch, capable of compiling the Linux kernel. After nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and $20,000 in API costs, the agent team produced a 100,000-line compiler that can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V.&quot;

With agent teams, he said, &quot;multiple Claude instances work in parallel on a shared codebase without active human intervention.&quot;

One key task was getting round the need for &quot;an operator to be online and available to work jointly,&quot; which we presume means removing the need for Claude Code to wait for a human to tell it what to do next.

&quot;To elicit sustained, autonomous progress, I built a harness that sticks Claude in a simple loop... When it finishes one task, it immediately picks up the next.&quot; Imagine if humans took that sort of approach.

Carlini continued: &quot;I leave it up to each Claude agent to decide how to act. In most cases, Claude picks up the &#39;next most obvious&#39; problem.&quot; This threw up a number of lessons, including the need to &quot;write extremely high quality tests.&quot;

Readers were also advised to &quot;put yourself in Claude&#39;s shoes.&quot; That means the &quot;test harness should not print thousands of useless bytes&quot; to make it easier for Claude to find what it needs.

Also, &quot;Claude can&#39;t tell time and, left alone, will happily spend hours running tests instead of making progress.&quot;

Which might make you feel working with Claude is closer to working with a regular human than you might have thought. But what was the upshot of all of this?

&quot;Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions across two weeks, Opus 4.6 consumed 2 billion input tokens and generated 140 million output tokens, a total cost just under $20,000.&quot;

This made it &quot;an extremely expensive project&quot; compared to the priciest Claude Max plans, Carlini said. &quot;But that total is a fraction of what it would cost me to produce this myself – let alone an entire team.&quot;

Other lessons? &quot;The compiler successfully builds many projects, but not all. It&#39;s not yet a drop-in replacement for a real compiler.&quot; Moreover, &quot;the generated code is not very efficient.&quot;

He added that the Rust code quality is &quot;reasonable but... nowhere near the quality of what an expert Rust programmer might produce.&quot;

Carlini concluded: &quot;Agent teams show the possibility of implementing entire, complex projects autonomously.&quot;

But as a former pen-tester, he said fully autonomous development posed real risks. &quot;The thought of programmers deploying software they&#39;ve never personally verified is a real concern.&quot; Ultimately, the experiment &quot;excites me, [but] also leaves me feeling uneasy.&quot;

Comments on GitHub were less equivocal, not least because they felt the $20K price tag ignored a few other elements, such as the vast amount of other programmers&#39; code the model was trained on in the first place.

As mohswell put it: &quot;If I went to the supermarket, stole a bit of every bread they had, and shoved it together, no one would say I made bread from scratch. They&#39;d say I&#39;m a thief. If this is &#39;from scratch,&#39; then my cooking is farm-to-table.&quot;

While Sambit003 opined: &quot;The comment section and the issue itself is &#39;absolute cinema&#39; moment everyone living through😂... the longer the AI generated codes I see... the safer I feel. 😂 Still we have the jobs (for long enough years)... just enjoy the overhyping bruh.&quot;

Serkosal added plaintively: &quot;okay, nice, could @claude find gf for me? No? I&#39;m not interested.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you&#39;re running an online business, it helps to own a memorable domain. That&#39;s why a wealthy tech exec just paid $70 million to buy the hottest word you can own: AI.com.

The deal was brokered by Larry Fischer of getyourdomain.com, according to the Financial Times, and is the most expensive domain purchase in history, eclipsing the previous record – $49.7 million for CarInsurance.com.

The buyer was Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com. While the figure is eye-watering, it is considerably less than the $100 million Fisher was bandying around in 2025. According to the Financial Times, Fischer said: &quot;With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes. When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.&quot;

While the final figure is not the nine-figure sum mooted last year, it is not to be sniffed at.

Marszalek told the FT that he hoped AI.com could offer similar features to OpenClaw – ideally without the associated security nightmares of the vibe-coded agent farm.

He added that there were &quot;good business reasons&quot; for coughing up so much for AI.com. &quot;There is a big desire for us to own this touchpoint, otherwise you get commoditized. I thought it was quite interesting that one person can own two domains that stand for such important categories.&quot;

Marszalek is doubtless expecting lightning to strike twice, given the impressive growth of Crypto.com in an already crowded market. According to the company&#39;s website, it has more than 150 million users globally. As the AI bubble continues to inflate, the $70 million paid for AI.com could end up looking like a canny investment. Or it could be the final note in the symphony of hubris that accompanies both crypto and AI.

Marszalek&#39;s purchase coincides with growing investor jitters over the amounts being poured into a technology that has yet to justify the funds lavished on it. Then again, Marszalek told the FT he was taking a long-term view of &quot;10 to 20 years.&quot;

The purchase price was reportedly paid entirely in cryptocurrency. It would probably be best not to check the Bitcoin prices for a bit. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Salesforce has decided to stop developing new features for its Heroku platform-as-a-service.

Senior VP and general manager at Salesforce Nitin T. Bhat delivered the news with a late Friday afternoon post – timing that public relations types call “taking out the trash” because they hope releasing bad news at the end of the working week means it goes unnoticed.

Bhat also used some very indirect language to describe what Salesforce is doing, kicking off with, “Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support.”

He described the platform’s new status as an “actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features.”

Existing customers can continue to use Heroku and renew subscriptions, but Salesforce won&#39;t offer enterprise contracts to new customers.

Heroku is a PaaS layer that runs atop AWS&#39;s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and relies on a version of PostgreSQL. Salesforce acquired Heroku in 2010 and for years suggested it as the ideal environment in which to build and run custom apps for its CRM and other SaaS-y applications, despite also offering its own Force.com app development and hosting platform. In recent years, Salesforce has pushed its Agentforce service as its premier offering for custom development, as it’s an agentic-AI-centric offering and the company is all-in on AI.

Heroku wasn’t immune to that push and has added AI features.

Bhat’s post suggests Salesforce has tired of maintaining multiple development platforms for AI apps, as his post poses the question “Why this change?” and answers it by stating “We’re focusing our product and engineering investments on areas where we can deliver the greatest long-term customer value, including helping organizations build and deploy enterprise-grade AI in a secure and trusted way.”

Independent analyst Michael Warrilow told The Register, &quot;Developers loved Heroku. Exorbitant pricing killed it and Agentforce put the nail in the coffin.&quot;

He advised migration away from Heroku. “Thankfully, Salesforce is giving existing customers a window to act,” he said.

Providers of Heroku alternatives are already spruiking their wares, and users are reminiscing about good times using the platform and mourning its imminent irrelevance.

And plenty are criticizing Salesforce’s decision.

“Salesforce spent the last two years putting Agentforce on every keynote stage and earnings call,” wrote CTO advisor Keith Townsend, a consultant to IT execs. But Townsend thinks Agentforce is missing important features – namely “a governance-aware execution layer that constrains what AI-generated applications can do, enforces policy at the point of creation, and preserves auditability by design.”

He believes “Heroku was closer to being that layer than almost anything else in the market. Salesforce just never saw it that way,” and that the SaaS giant may therefore come to regret its decision to put the product out to pasture.

“That underinvestment may turn out to be one of the most expensive strategic misreads in enterprise AI.”

Ivan Burazin, CEO of daytona.io, an outfit that provides infrastructure and sandboxes to run AI-generated code, also thinks Salesforce has made a poor decision.

“Startups are raising millions to build ephemeral environments for agents, while one of the OG sandbox providers is exiting the race. Instead of evolving Heroku into a definitive infrastructure for the agentic AI era, Salesforce is letting a developer goldmine wither away,” he wrote, before concluding, “Never doubt big tech&#39;s ability to kill great products!” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Carl Eschenbach has stepped down as Workday CEO and been replaced by co-founder and executive Aneel Bhusri following a round of job cuts and share price volatility.

In a statement [PDF] to investors, the company said Eschenbach is set to get an aggregate lump sum cash payment of $3.6 million, including cash severance benefits.

Workday provides enterprise HR and finance software as a service. Like many SaaS vendors, its value has been hard hit over the last week as investors consider the impact of AI on the market. Over the last year, its share price has fallen by around 40 percent.

Eschenbach was appointed CEO in January 2024, succeeding Bhusri&#39;s first tenure in the role. In February 2025, Workday announced it was cutting 8.5 percent of its personnel – equivalent to around 1,750 positions – under a restructuring scheme because of AI investment.

The company later said it would rehire different roles and skills, intending to &quot;ultimately have the same amount of people working,&quot; CFO Zane Rowe told investors in June last year.

In September, activist investors took a $2 billion stake in Workday. At the time, Eschenbach cast doubt on the company&#39;s rehiring plans. &quot;We don&#39;t need more headcount to drive the business forward,&quot; he told investors.

Last week, the company said it was laying off about 2 percent of its staff in a bid to align its people with its &quot;highest priorities,&quot; hitting margins for the quarter and the year.

In a prepared statement, Mark Hawkins, Workday vice chair and lead independent director, said Eschenbach had stepped in at &quot;a pivotal time&quot; and helped Workday &quot;mature into a more global, disciplined organization.&quot;

Bhusri said: &quot;I&#39;m deeply grateful to Carl for leading Workday through an important chapter – scaling the company, building on our foundation, and positioning us well for what&#39;s ahead. We&#39;re now entering one of the most pivotal moments in our history. AI is a bigger transformation than SaaS – and it will define the next generation of market leaders. I&#39;m energized to return as CEO, working alongside our presidents Gerrit Kazmaier and Rob Enslin, and I&#39;m excited about the opportunity in front of us.&quot;

Eschenbach&#39;s youthful exploits in college wrestling earned him hall-of-fame status. Perhaps investor sentiment proved to be an opponent too difficult to pin down. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) says it was one of the many organizations popped when attackers raced to exploit recent Ivanti vulnerabilities as zero-days.

Justice secretary Arno Rutte and secretary for kingdom relations Eddie van Marum co-authored a letter to the Dutch parliament, confirming that an attack involving January&#39;s Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) bugs led to a data breach.

The attack took place on January 29, the letter confirmed, and affected employees of both the AP and the Council for the Judiciary (RVDR).

Attackers may have accessed personal data including names, business email addresses, and phone numbers.

The senior ministers did not comment on the scale of the breach in terms of specific numbers, but said all of the affected individuals have been informed directly.

And to whom does a country&#39;s data protection authority report itself in such cases? The answer is its data protection officer, in this instance, while the AP&#39;s usual staff are looking into the breach at RVDR, which reported itself to the authority as normal.

While those investigations remain ongoing, the country&#39;s cybersecurity agency (NCSC-NL) is keeping tabs on the Ivanti EPMM vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340) and working with partners to understand additional threats the vulnerabilities present.

The Dutch office of the CIO (CIO Rijk) is also examining whether there is a broader risk to the central government, the letter stated.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed CVE-2026-1281 (9.8) was exploited in the wild by adding it to the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) list shortly after initial disclosure.

Ivanti&#39;s security advisory at the time stated: &quot;We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.&quot;

However, warnings from outside sources suggested the attacks could be more frequent than the vendor&#39;s &quot;very limited&quot; phrasing would suggest.

In its own warning about the Ivanti bugs, the UK&#39;s National Health Service (NHS) highlighted that EPMM devices are exposed to the web by design, making them ripe targets for attackers.

It said: &quot;Edge devices like EPMM are internet-facing by design and are highly attractive targets to attackers, and there are an increasing number of edge device vulnerabilities disclosed each year that are rapidly exploited by attackers.

&quot;The NHS England National CSOC assesses it is highly likely vulnerabilities discovered in edge devices will continue to be exploited as zero-day vulnerabilities, or shortly after vendor disclosure.&quot;

Benjamin Harris, CEO at watchTowr, also said around the time of the bugs&#39; disclosure that EPMM devices are often used by high-value organizations, according to intel gleaned from the company&#39;s own customer base.

&quot;While patches are available from Ivanti, applying patches will not be enough. Threat actors have been exploiting these vulnerabilities as zero-days, and organizations that are, as of disclosure, exposing vulnerable instances to the internet must consider them compromised, tear down infrastructure, and instigate incident response processes.&quot; ®

The Sony WF-1000XM6 will reportedly feature a faster processor and an upgrade to eight mics instead of six.

Following images of Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 earbuds shared by a retailer last week ahead of an official announcement, reliable leaker billbil-kun has revealed what they’re claiming are the full specs and new features of the company’s next flagship buds.

The WF-1000XM6 will be powered by a new QN3e processor that’s “three times faster” than what’s inside the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds that debuted over two-and-a-half years ago. The upgraded processor will provide improved ANC performance alongside the addition of two more microphones, giving the WF-1000XM6 eight in total. The new earbuds will also feature a “new speaker, an improved DAC, and an enhanced amplifier,” according to billbil-kun.

Battery life for the buds themselves will still be up to eight hours with ANC turned on, which can be extended by an extra 16 hours using their charging case, matching both the WF-1000XM5 and 2021’s WF-1000XM4. As revealed last week through the early photos, Sony is also further refining the size, shape, and ergonomics of the WF-1000XM6 so they’re more comfortable to wear with “insulated tips” that could provide an improved fit. When connected to the Sony | Sound Connect app, you’ll also have more control over how music sounds using an equalizer that’s being upgraded from five adjustable bands to 10.

﻿Kernel version 6.19 includes a performance boost for older AMD GPUs.

On Sunday, Linux developer Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux 6.19, which will be the last update in this kernel cycle, as previously reported by Phoronix. It adds support for the modern AMDGPU driver for older AMD GCN 1.0 and 1.1 graphics cards, like Radeon HD 7000 series GPUs, along with Vulkan support through the RADV driver, and improved power management.

Linux 6.19 also includes improved HDR support with the addition of the DRM Color Pipeline, an updated Asus Armoury driver, expanded support for newer Intel Wildcat Lake and Nova Lake chips, PCIe link encryption and device authentication, and more.

Along with the launch of Linux 6.19, Torvalds also teased the start of a new kernel cycle with the next update. “As people have mostly figured out, I’m getting to the point where I’m being confused by large numbers (almost running out of fingers and toes again), so the next kernel is going to be called 7.0,” writes Linus in the update note. The next update could include even more improvements for AMD GPUs, display support for Intel Nova Lake and Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chips, and expanded sensor monitoring support for Asus motherboards, among other changes.

Users on rolling release or semi-rolling release Linux distributions like Fedora and Arch can expect to get the most recent kernel update soon through their regular system updates. Distros that aren’t rolling release may take longer to get kernel updates.

            <div id="article-text">Roland Busch on AI-powered factories, tariffs in the Trump era, trade, and the future of NATO.

Today, I’m talking with Roland Busch, who is the CEO of Siemens.

Siemens is one of those absolutely giant, extremely important, but fairly opaque companies we love to dig into on Decoder. At a very basic, reductive level, Siemens makes the hardware and software that allow other companies to run and automate their stuff. Everyone has seen the Siemens logo somewhere, whether it’s under the hood of their cars, stamped on control systems in fancy buildings, or scattered across factory floors. But since it’s not really a consumer-facing company, it’s hard to know what ties all these ideas together — and what some 320,000 Siemens employees across the world are actually working on.

How all those people are organized and work together is wildly complicated. Roland and I spent some real time just talking through the Siemens corporate structure, which, for my true Decoderheads out there, was incredibly fascinating.

We also spent a lot of time talking about automation broadly and what happens as AI brings automation from the physical world of factories into the digital world of accounting and procurement — the things that help decide what factories should be doing. Roland’s vision is for Siemens to automate the whole factory process, upstream and downstream of actually making things. And you’ll hear him describe that outcome as fairly utopian: a smooth, seamless, optimal operation. Very German. But I wanted to press him on how dystopian it sounds to me. Because in Roland’s vision, it seems like there’s a whole class of people who just… don’t have jobs anymore. And the ones who do have jobs don’t really have a whole lot of autonomy or fulfillment from them, but basically just serve as the hands for the all-seeing AI. So I asked him fairly directly about that.

And if that’s not already all complicated enough: Siemens is a government and defense contractor on both sides of the Atlantic and a company whose overall growth is directly tied to free trade and globalization in the postwar era. A lot is going on right now that might challenge how the world works, especially if tensions keep rising between the US and Europe, and so I had to ask him point-blank: Do you think about what you’ll do if NATO collapses? Because that’s not as far-fetched a question as it used to be.

There’s a lot in this one, and Roland was game for it all. I think you’ll leave with a lot to think about — certainly more to think about whenever you see all those Siemens logos.

Okay: Siemens CEO Roland Busch. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Roland Busch, you are the president and CEO of Siemens. Welcome to Decoder.

It’s nice to meet you as well. There’s a lot to talk about. Siemens is a huge company. It has a long history. You’ve been in a lot of businesses, you’ve been out of a lot of businesses. You have worked there since the ‘90s. The world is very complicated right now, and Siemens is a very big, very complicated multinational operating in that world. I’m curious how you are thinking of all that.

So let me just start at the start: Siemens isn’t a consumer company. I think a lot of Decoder listeners have seen the logo, but maybe don’t understand the company. How would you describe Siemens today? What is the company?

Indeed, it’s not that easy. We have come a long way. It’s been more than 170 years since the company was founded, and we made so many changes in our portfolio and in our company. Actually, when people talk about it, I say there’s one constant in our history, which is that we reinvented ourselves over and over again. And absolutely, we are now in the midst of another reinvention or transformation with one difference. This is the fastest and most fundamental one we ever had because of technology. And then people ask, “What is Siemens about? Because you now have Siemens Healthineers, you have Siemens Energy, you have Siemens?”

And actually, it’s not that easy to describe. Siemens Healthineers has the task in its name. It’s about healthcare. Siemens Energy has the task in its name; it’s about energy. But Siemens is not that clear. So here is how I explain it. We transform, with our technology, every day for everyone. Okay, that doesn’t get you closer. But now, the point is that you have to look behind the curtain, and then you see what Siemens technology does.

When you see a car passing by… Eventually, all cars will be touched by Siemens technology. It is either cars that are designed by our technology, or they are manufactured by it. Every third manufacturing line in the world is run by Siemens controls. If you walk through New York, you cannot walk a block without passing by a building that is automated by Siemens technology. I think we are controlling ... I mean, something like a little bit less than 50 percent of electrons are touched by Siemens technologies in our distribution systems, low voltage systems. And if you talk about healthcare, if you get a scan somewhere in the world, the likelihood that it’s a Siemens CT or MR scan is a little bit shy of 50 percent. And this is what we do. We produce. We have technology which enables others to transform their everyday. And that is what Siemens is about.

So I listen to that, and I experience Siemens everywhere. I’m the person who pays attention to how a building is automated. I talk to a lot of car CEOs; I hear about Siemens as a supplier to the car industry quite a bit. It sounds like what you were describing basically is you operate things for people, or you build technologies or products that operate other things for people.

There are a lot of things in the world to operate. How do you organize the company? How do you think about where there’s opportunity and where there’s growth and investment, and then how do you think about your resources? Because it seems like we operate things for everyone. That’s a pretty wide remit that you could focus down in any number of ways.

This is an absolutely valid question because now we are active in so many different industries. It’s industries, manufacturing, process industries, but we are also in buildings, grids, and mobility. So people, trains, and signaling systems. The first basis of Siemens is — and this is where our value sits — in our technology platform, and in our design software. We have one of the largest software companies in the world. If it comes to industrial software, we are the largest. And with our software, you can build the most comprehensive physics-based digital twin of whatever product you do. And we are now expanding into molecules. So another one is automation technology, as talked about, or it can be for discrete process manufacturing. We also go for software-defined automation, which is kind of a disruption. Anything. We are the largest automation company. We are automating grids, we’re automating buildings, we’re automating signaling systems, we’re automating trains, and we are automating manufacturing. So the underlying technology is where the value is.

Now, we are bringing this technology to different verticals, so markets. It’s the industrial markets, food and beverage, chemicals, automotive, machine builders, utilities, mobility operators, and the like. And then at this point, the domain know-how comes into play. So having technology is one thing, but having the domain know-how to deploy it, to talk customers’ language, is another one. And on top, quite obviously, is that the whole thing is now supercharged by AI technologies, which we are rolling in as we speak. We have a long history regarding AI. Actually, one of the first supercomputers to do machine learning algorithms was Synopsys. I mean, this was in the ‘90s. Siemens had the most powerful one. This was the great-grandfather of the GPUs today.

And since then, we have been working with artificial intelligence technologies, but this is now a new level that we want to bring it to. So the organization, obviously, we are organizing according to businesses. They are reflecting the markets we are acting in, but you have to look at it from the back, the underlying technology, including the data, which is super relevant.

I’m very curious to talk to you about AI and automation. I think that’s very important. Digital twins, I’m curious about that. It seems like the future of automation is very rich. We’re moving from Siemens automating a lot of atoms, automating the physical world, to automating bits, and that’s a long conversation that I want to come to.

I just want to stay focused on the company for one more turn here and ask the Decoder questions, because I feel like the structure of Siemens says a lot about the company itself. I was reading your last letter to shareholders. You were talking about how you’ve divested portfolio companies where you weren’t the best owner, you’re exiting some businesses, and you’re obviously investing in others. How is Siemens organized today? How is the company structured?

We run according to businesses. One is digital industries, which is all about the software, the automation piece. One is smart infrastructure. Here you’ll find our building technology, medium voltage, low voltage, but also the grid, grid automation, grid control, and grid soft control software. The third element is Siemens mobility, where we have our trains, high-speed locomotives, commuter, metro, light rail, but also rail infrastructure, including turnkey projects, which is part of that. And the last one, since we are still consolidating, is Siemens Healthineers, where we still hold some 70 percent. It is its own listed company, a DAX-listed company. We are about to let go. We announced a spinoff of 30 percent from 65-ish, but it’s a separate company. So that’s how we’re organized. Of course, we have our corporate organizations, like strategy. IT, we run horizontally. We have our M&A department, and I talked about our portfolio. So that’s what a corporation normally has.

And maybe one more special thing is that we still have research. We still invest 8 percent of our revenue, so $6.5 billion, a portion of which goes into research advancements. We work on a quantum computer. We don’t build them, but we run on the software, the middleware, how to use it, and the applications. And we have also machine learning and KEI experts who are doing research there, like AI experts. So that’s roughly how the company runs. And then talking about regions, we have in total, including Healthineers, 320,000 people. We have 45,000 people sitting in the United States, 30,000 in China, 35,000 in India, and roughly 85,000 in Germany. It’s still a German company. There’s a lot of manufacturing here.

Let me ask you about that split between regions. I think a theme on Decoder recently, and you are a part of this trend, is that a lot of these companies are a lot bigger than people think. You described divisions, you described regions. Those are both potentially first-order organizations for companies, right? I talk to lots of CEOs, and regions are just the first-order organization. Other companies are divisions. You have both. How do those interact?

Yeah, I can tell you, this is a constant discussion because we have very strong regional leads. We have strong businesses. So this is a matrix, and every company has this matrix, and the first question is, which one is the predominant line? Is it the business or the regions? In our case, it’s a clear answer; it’s the businesses. So the businesses have the full P&L. Regions are, let’s say, the second derivative behind it. Still very strong. And we have, in some businesses, let’s take, for example, our low voltage business, switching technology, this business is fully run by regions. You have China, you have the United States, you have Europe, and this is their P&L. So roll it up by regions. If you talk about automation, the next level is still ... It’s motion control for machine builders, it’s factory automation, it’s process automation, and then come the regions. Therefore, you still have a different kind of setup depending on the business on how we serve technologies.

And then the third dimension, just to make it a little bit more complicated for you, is the verticals, because factory automation… Take factory automation, which is maybe the strongest automation business we have; they run into any kind of factory automation you can imagine. The discreet and hybrids, food and beverage, and automotive machines. Machine builders are by machine, control is another one, but then you have a lot of battery manufacturing, and you have semiconductors. Therefore, this is the third dimension to serve verticals, because each of them has a different language and different applications. So we are having a very, let’s say, three-dimensional matrix, but there’s a clear lead, and this is driven by the business lines.

Yeah. I ask everybody on Decoder how the businesses are structured. And the joke I always make is, if you tell me how the company is structured, I can tell you 80 percent of your problems. But in the case of Siemens, it seems like I’m still trying to figure it all out to even get to where the problems are. When you think about that organization, and you describe things like a common platform or shared innovation across these zones or the investments you need to make in AI, a lot of your competitors are new. They’re essentially functionally organized.

There’s one person driving the business in the case of some of these startups. Siemens is very old. It’s organized divisionally, and then obviously, there are layers of organization between it. How do you think about investing in the core technologies, the core platforms in that structure? Because it seems like all of your divisions should be doing it, perhaps in redundant or repetitive ways.

Yeah, and you’re right. When I explain my organization, you can identify the problems or the opportunities, put it that way. And here comes the point. I talked about how we are investing $6.5 billion into R&D, and obviously, this goes into different businesses. And some of them have a higher share. This is 8 percent on average. Some of them are sitting on definitely more than 10 percent, 13 percent, 15 percent, some others are at 3 percent and 4 percent. So, capital allocation, is it R&D? Is it in CapEx, or also spending? That’s done business by business. Each of them has a business case, and we allocate capital. In some cases, we obviously want to allocate more capital in higher growth areas. And I talk about organic capital allocation if it comes to M&A. This is something that happens on the board. We come up with proposals, and we see where we want to spend more money and where we focus our M&A, and where we do not.

But then here comes the point, and this is the part of our ONE Tech company program. Actually, I started last year, together with my fellow board members, maybe one of the most fundamental transformations of our organizations, because you’re completely right, we are very much boxed. Below these businesses I talked about, like digital industries, we have software, and then we have automation. Automation is three boxes: factory automation, process automation, and motion control. Below that, we have even segments, so I just didn’t give you that complexity as well. We are very much boxed. And what we want to do is take layers out, so we bring that into bigger boxes. Actually, we are targeting six units. But then we also say we want to create fabrics, which is a kind of operating system where we have horizontal ones. So we have a data fabric, a technology fabric, and we have a sales fabric.

So the idea behind this fabric is it’s a thin layer, but it’s a very strong one where we are really scaling horizontally as much as we can. For sales fabric, for example, we want to use the same tools, the same nomenclature for customers. And believe it or not, if I ask today how much revenue we do with BMW, people have to run out and pile the numbers together. This stops now because we have one identifier for BMW, and with a push of a button, I know what to do. So they serve the same sales methodology. Also, the customer journeys should all be alike. Technology fabric is that we don’t do things over and over again. When we talk about a digital platform where we sell, we build it only once and sell our portfolio.

So this is a change. We are unboxing our organization in two little boxes. And the reason is… Number one is technology, and AI in particular doesn’t respect silos. AI doesn’t respect data silos, doesn’t respect any kind of boundaries. The world is squeezing out the small. You see that this is adding more and more, and the more data you have, the more capabilities you have, the stronger you are. It’s a fact. Look at the big companies. Therefore, we have to play to the strengths of Siemens, and this requires a different way of running this company. This is behind our ONE Tech company program, which is really pulling in horizontally as much as we can, yet respecting different go-to-markets and different kinds of technologies or applications of technologies, depending on the verticals we are serving. So, not losing our strengths, which we have built over so many years, while scaling horizontally. Does it make sense?

It does. I’ve never been so excited to talk about structure with anyone as I have been with you, because that seems very hard. Well, it seems like what you’re describing to me is a multi-hundred-year-old company that has traditionally been very divisional, trying to get to some functional structures so that you can move faster. And that traditionally has come with culture cost, it has come with disruption inside the company, it’s come with inertia. How are you dealing with that at a company the size of Siemens? There are 320,000 people. They can’t all be happy with you.

It’s hard. It’s hard. So where do you start? Give a little bit of insight into how we did in the past and how we do it right now with our ONE Tech company program. In the past, we had many restructurings and many changes. The point was a managing board, these are typically something, but we have now seven people, and we used to have 15 or more, whatever. In the past, these guys were going together with their strategies in a room, defining a new structure, laying out a new org chart, and then, “Dear colleagues, this is where we want to go, and we reshuffle.” Okay. You can imagine how that goes down. This time, we created a north star where we want to be. The north star is basically what I sketched to you, these fabrics, the businesses, but allow them to focus on what they need to do, focus on their customers, on their applications, but yet we want to get horizontals into it.

And then we said, “This is a north star and here are, we call it tracks, the tracks to the north star. These are the points where we really want to touch.” For example, our CRM system for automation was completely scattered. We want to do that, and this is a blueprint for the whole company, which can go on and on. And then we engaged people to say, “Let’s go,, and you work with us now on these tracks and how to change it.” That means we give the people an opportunity to contribute, to bring their ideas, but we have a clear idea of where we want to go in order to move first. Secondly, you obviously need to communicate a lot. You have to explain what you do because you’re describing something where people don’t know where it goes; they’re not experienced to work that way. But you have to talk about it over and over again, explain why we do it, what the benefits are, and what changes for the people.

And for some, they said, “I don’t experience any change.” “Yes, because we don’t touch everything. We touch only things where you really can improve.” And some we just let go, because why would you fix something that’s not broken? The next one is that we train our people, because transformation is not just shifting boxes; it’s a different set of values. Collaboration is a much, much more important element in it. So we are putting a lot of emphasis on helping them also. And change is not only a structure, but it’s also the processes behind the way you lead. And the last thing is, obviously, you also want to inject capabilities from the outside, on a higher level, where you have people who know what good looks like when it comes to a super professional sales organization, when it comes to AI technologies and more developing models, and this helps a lot.

And then we do that all over the company, on the lower level, and the higher level. But if you talk to a really high-level person, if you come with people who really have the gravitas, who bring the experience where nobody would doubt that if they say, “This is how modern software looks like,” they have authority themselves without giving them the stars and stripes. They just put people together and say, “This is how we go.” And people listen and follow. So this is the package, and you need all of them, all of them, in order to make this transformation.

And I can say it seems to work. I had a huge respect for it. I’m a lifetimer at Siemens, and I saw in my 30 years so many changes and programs. And before pulling the trigger for this big change, which is the deepest one for the last at least 20 years, you think about it twice, because if this vessel runs in the wrong direction, you have a problem. And we have to deliver at the same time. But I pulled the trigger because I knew that we had to change. The environment of technology is changing so fast, so we have to be at the forefront, but I’m quite happy because it has been running for one year and is making good progress. There’s another one ahead of us. By the end of the fiscal year… So by the end of this, by October, November, we are basically through with all the big moves and the changes, and we are already grooving in the first batch of changes we made. Sales seem to work quite well. We are grooving in. And then within two years, I would say we are ready to scale.

Let me ask you the other Decoder question I ask everybody. This is a big decision. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions?

The first thing about decisions is empowerment. Don’t pull every decision up to the boardroom. It makes us slow. It is really not attracting people. People want to really make decisions on a lower level. So basic ideas, deciding on the lowest possible level. However, empowerment is not anarchy. If you have a clear strategy with those set boundaries, this is where I want to go. Within that frame, within your responsibility, you can act and are empowered. Empowered is a two-way street as well. Empowerment gives freedom, but it also requires accountability. So if you empower somebody, they have to be accountable for what the people are doing, which is super important. This is the first thing. So don’t decide on things that you can decide on a lower level.

But then, if it comes to, let’s say, the bigger rocks, the M&A decisions, this really goes into a very ... I mean, we have processes, how we do it. We had a “P” proposal, which is a proposal where somebody says, “This is a company I want to acquire. This is my business case.” Outside in, in order to say, “Okay, now we believe in that.” You give your trigger, you already know how to negotiate, go forward, and make a non-binding offer. And then they work on it. We have a lot of processes, and when it comes up, we call it an “I” proposal where we finally pull the trigger to say, “Now you can invest, and you can go.”

And the decisions are, when it comes to strategies, engaging as many people as we can, the experts, listening to them in the boardroom. In some cases, we also ask them not to prepare a super-polished PowerPoint. That’s not the point. We want to really get the content. And then we have a very open discussion culture in our management board with our leaders to make better decisions. Very often, I’m also snorkeling around. We are getting advice from others, pulling our network if it comes to certain decisions. But I would say it’s a structured process, but it’s a process which encourages people to speak up, to bring their opinion in order to come to better decisions.

Let me ask one more question here, then I want to talk about the state of the world, and I really do want to talk about how you see AI and digital twins fitting into automation, because there’s a lot there.

Let’s say I’m a Siemens engineer working on low voltage switch gear. I’m one of 35,000 people in India, and I’m like, the CEO’s at CES talking about fabrics with [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang on stage, and we’re in the middle of a two-year transformation ... But I just need to get my work done, and this is all just some corporate strategy distraction. How do you bring those two things together? Because this is the thing that kills projects at big companies. It kills them dead. And the number of times I’ve heard that story is very high. So how do you bring that together?

I know. There’s the first one, and this is so super important for communication because, and you got it right, low voltage. This is as mechanical as it can get. This is mechanical stuff, so it’s no software, no KEI, if not in the development, of course. But normally, this is a product that is hardware. Not only because we have now solid state switching, which is disruptive, which brings software into it, but take that aside. And then talking about being on stage, talking about KEI, new models, and digital twins, the people sometimes feel lost. Push is always talking about that stuff, but I’m just doing mechanicals. So we have to give love to these guys as well because they do a lot in terms of contributing to top and bottom line cash flow to our company. They are part of the equation.

If you go to any kind of customer, they say, “I love your automation. I love your software, but still I have to do some switching here,” and we are rolling in. And it’s super relevant because if you don’t have a switch or if it breaks, then you have a problem. So they bring the capabilities to a customer and say — we also have some low voltage here — but really say, “This is important for you to have a very solid operation.” It makes sense, and they are proud to contribute. So you have to distribute your love not only to the new stuff, but also to those that are basically super important and carry our P&L forward. And then the other element is, believe it or not, this CES presentation or keynote where you really are on par with ... I mean, Jensen’s there, Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] is there, and you show what we do and people ... Even the low voltage guys are proud of what we do.

I’ll give a last one because I have to share it with you. We didn’t talk about a completely different area, which is mobility, Siemens Mobility. They do trains. This is hard stuff, boogies, frames, mechanical. These trains are super loaded with automation. These are basically software-defined trains because they tell you whatever ... Even before they come to the depot, they tell the depot what they need, which part, what’s wrong, and how to replace it. So it’s technology at its best. However, which company can say that we are transforming the whole economy of 110 million people in a country, which is Egypt? It’s where we built 2,000 kilometers of railway lines from the north to the south, west to the east, connecting 90 million people and transforming the whole system with high-speed commuters and locomotives. This makes people proud, and I didn’t mention any AI technology, even though it’s in our trains, but this is something where we could say, “Who? Which and who? Which company in the world can do that?”

I’m very curious about all of that. I think there’s some amount of, you said, software-defined low voltage switches or software on the trains. Those worlds are colliding. I want to ask broadly just about the landscape you’re operating in to do all of that work. These are big opportunities at work. If you want to sell trains, you need to be a global company. You can’t be a single country train supplier. You have to operate everywhere.

I look at Siemens and its size and its history, and I say, “Okay, this company took advantage of globalization and free trade.” You’re in all these countries around the world, you’ve got tens of thousands of people all over the place, you’re building products all over the place, you’re taking advantage of the opportunities and the markets you’re in, the talent that’s in those markets.

And then I look up, and I read the newspaper, and the walls are going up around the world, everywhere, every single day. The Trump administration seems intent on putting ever-higher walls between the US and Europe, in particular, which seems very confusing to me. Other countries are nationalists in other ways. How are you thinking about Siemens in that moment, where a company that was able to grow and be such a large provider to so many people because of free trade and globalization, now has to contend with ever-higher walls and barriers between countries?

Obviously, we believe in free trade more than trade barriers because it brought the world to where we are, and leveraging all technology as fast as possible means bringing it to different countries as fast as possible. The good news about it is, and I mentioned our footprint before, since we are global from the very beginning… By the way, when Werner von Siemens founded this company 175 years or more ago, he sent one brother to London and one to Russia because he knew Germany was too small for his technology to scale. Ever since, Siemens has been a global company. And now our local for local content in the United States or China is 85 percent, 87 percent. So that means we are so local, and we have goods traveling from different places. So the impact on tariffs currently, and we said it last year, it’s a public figure, in 2025 last fiscal year was a low, mid-single-digit bottom-line impact.

Okay, that’s good for us. It’s maybe not good for others. Our customers are suffering, and with our customers, we are suffering, obviously. We know that machine builders have a reduced volume because their machines are tariffed when they go to the United States. Along with that, normally comes a Siemens Automation, so we see that, but the direct impact is rather low. It’s a second impact. And we are increasing our resilience as we speak. As it comes to certain semiconductors, we are trying to double source as much as possible, which we didn’t do before, in order to scale. We are looking for more localization to invest in the United States. We doubled our capacity for low voltage, medium voltage switching. We invested in assembly lines for trains. Investing in the United States. We are investing in India and China because that is one of our largest markets. Therefore, the good news is that we are quite resilient. Bad news is that for many, many of our customers, it doesn’t help, and it somehow slows down.

When you talk about investing in manufacturing in the United States, I’ve watched a lot of companies say a lot of things about investing in manufacturing in the United States. I’m from Racine, Wisconsin. I watched Foxconn insist that it was going to build an LCD factory in Racine, Wisconsin, and then simply not do that. And I watched Tim Cook reopen a factory that was already making Macs, so Donald Trump, in his first term, could say that Apple was opening a factory. There is a lot of theater about manufacturing in the United States, and then there’s the reality of investing for the long term when presidents come and go. How are you balancing that? Is it theater? Is it real investment? What is the split?

So the truth is, it’s a little bit of both. Where it’s real, let’s talk about the pharmaceutical industry. This is real investment. The Swiss ones, the German ones, are investing in pharmaceutical production in the United States. Some car makers that are not that strong, do that. But the big wave of remanufacturing in the United States is not happening yet. We don’t see that. And the reason is, maybe you mentioned it, number one, is the availability of people, also trained people. It is that you don’t know yet where the whole tariff situation will settle at the end of the day. The other reason is, why are we in a world that looks this way? It’s because American companies, in particular, were basically leveraging low labor costs and low costs in other countries, and they made a good living out of it. And you mentioned some of them as well. So do I believe that this will change? Yes. I believe there will be a wave, and we do see more manufacturing coming.

And I didn’t mention semiconductors. Definitely, this is a hard fact. Semiconductor builds. Maybe even battery factories would come, pharmaceuticals, and the like. The only point I always advise our customers is that if you build a new manufacturing line in the United States, make it as automated and as digital as possible for obvious reasons, because you cannot get enough labor, let alone trained labor. And technology is there. So if you go there with a greenfield planned, you have all the freedoms to make this whole thing digital before even sending the first excavation machine. Your products, digitalizing your manufacturing, simulate everything. That’s what we do, by the way. Whenever we build a new one, we go all in. And then you build it. It’s faster. You don’t make mistakes in building. It increases your space productivity and reduces your energy consumption. It increases your output while having more variables and more variants of your products. So that will come, but we thought it would come faster; it seems there’s a delay in really ramping up manufacturing in the United States. And again, maybe sector by sector, you’ll see different patterns.

Do you think that’s because people assume that there will be a snap back to normal trade relations in the world, or do you think it’s just slow?

The latter one. I don’t believe these tariffs will just snap back. Why? Tariffs, more or less, are like taxes, and they help close the budget deficit. And I never saw taxes going back. I hope that this may come to more normal terms. For example, our machines, which are exported to the United States, suffer from tariffs, but they also face these tariffs on aluminum and steel on top of that, which makes them quite expensive. So maybe that goes away. There might be some adoptions, which I think will come, but I don’t believe that this goes back to where we came from.

Look, I have a rudimentary understanding of economics.

I studied this as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago 20 years ago. My understanding of all this is that this is how you equalize labor rates. You say, “Okay, you can make the products cheaper overseas. We’ll just put a tariff on top of it. Now the product is as expensive as making it in the United States, so you might as well make it here.” And that is bluntly what the Trump administration is haphazardly trying to convey. But what you’re saying is, “We’re Siemens. We make automation. We can virtually model the entire factory as a digital twin before you build it. In AI, we can automate even more. We can automate people using Excel to program your factory. Just build that.” And I look at that, and I say, “Well, that didn’t get anybody a job.” I look at data center investment in the United States, and communities around the United States are pushing back on data centers because they’re like, “This is a lot to extract from the environment and from our land, and not enough jobs.” And I see that same argument being applied to fully automated factories.

How do you push back against that? Is a fully automated factory a net addition to the economy, do you think?

It’s a net-add with fewer people per output, if you don’t automate. Absolutely. That’s absolutely clear. The point is, we are living in aging societies. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China are aging. There’s a really steep curve. So sooner or later, you will see that creating jobs like crazy is maybe not the point because you’re missing jobs anyhow, or labor anyhow. You might want to deploy the labor you have in jobs that you cannot replace. The social system, the healthcare system, and the like, use labor really where it makes a difference. And in manufacturing, you have less and less. This is changing. You still have people on our shop floor, but you will have fewer. And you said it right, an AI factory fully automated, this uses a lot of space, uses a lot of energy, and it creates a limited number of jobs. That’s what an AI factory is. Yeah.

I’m just saying, if I build a fully automated factory to make cars, but no one has a job, who buys the cars?

Again, as I said before, what you do when you have full auto manufacturing, you’re driving the economy, you grow faster. You can bring the production to the United States, which has value in it. And once the economy is growing, obviously, your GDP per capita is increasing, and people are going to buy cars, but they have a different deployment.

But where do they get the money? Again, a rudimentary understanding of economics.

So number one is you’re replacing blue collar workers with more trained workers, with engineers, maybe also blue collar workers using AI technology. So a factory doesn’t run without... Again, we have higher output with fewer people, but you still have ... I mean, I talked about it, the whole service sector is super relevant, and they’re missing people as well. Germany, for example, I can share about that. If we do not have hundreds of thousands of immigrants, and most of them working in service jobs, including hospitals and the like… If I take them out of the equation, our whole healthcare system would collapse. So there are a lot of jobs that you cannot replace. And that’s one more thing. When people ask me what to study, I say, “Okay, a solid education in mathematics or physics is always good, but if you don’t really feel like it, you can go for a plumbing job or a handicraft job, because that is the last job to be replaced.”

Yeah. The world needs electricians and plumbers for sure. That much I understand. Someone’s got to build and plumb the data centers, and maybe that’s the only career in the future. So your vision is like a fully automated factory. You’re talking about the higher-order jobs, like information jobs, technology jobs, and engineering jobs. I would call those software jobs. In some broad categorization, there’s some amount of white-collar work that has a laptop involved. That’s the next thing you could automate with AI. And you’ve made some gestures at that, right? We can automate even more of the things.

As I mentioned earlier, it seems like a lot of the frame for how you’re thinking is, Siemens has traditionally automated atoms, now you can automate bits.

And I see so much excitement about AI automating bits. How are you thinking about that, moving up from, okay, you’ve decided how many units to produce, we’ll produce them, to we’re going to actually automate the deciding of how many units to produce?

And this goes really deep because… And this is when we talk about this industrial operating system, an AI-based operating system, where you really talk about this manufacturing line, which is finally ... Running autonomously is a big word, but we are getting closer and closer to doing that. And here comes the point. Number one, it obviously starts with — and I’ll come to manufacturing in a second — but it starts with the design of your product. You create a digital twin of your product, and you simulate how it runs on a manufacturing line. And this loop of producing and simulating and producing your products, which you already have in the digital world, is so powerful. Because whenever you make a change, a component, maybe you want to be more resilient when designing another component, you go all the way back to your design drawings, you change it, and you know which part of manufacturing is impacted. So that’s very powerful.

But let me speak on the manufacturing line itself. The whole idea is that you start building this operating system, which is a layered system. Obviously, you need to get all the data that your manufacturing line produces. You have to connect to all your machines, the status of your machines, enrich them with environmental data, as you want to get the real-time data, even the drawing data of your machines as well, because once you have that, and you simulate it ... And this is what we call the digital twin composer. That means you’re sucking in different digital twins of a machine, of a line, of a product; you suck it in, and then you have a complete, comprehensive digital twin which ingests real-time data. Then you can go forward and backward in time, and you can find out what the problem is.

And then here comes the real one, when you close the loop of ingesting data but sending data back to the line, which is then the agent, which behaves on behalf of you. An agent is like a trained supervisor for a line. So when a red light is blinking, a supervisor goes there, looks at it, and says, “Oh yeah, this is a problem. I know that, over and over again, this is what I have to do.” And this is what AI agents can do. Finally, you still need somebody who is removing a blockage, changing, or updating. Maybe updating the software will be automatic, but changing a part, changing a piece, or having a switch where something is going wrong, you need people who know what to do. We tell them what to do with glasses. I also presented it at CES.

So this helps you interact in your natural words and helps you fix things, even if you don’t know all the details. This is where agents come in, or orchestration agents, which are supported by a machine building agent, a machine agent, a product agent, a workflow agent, whatever. And that’s how the future looks, which is very powerful. It keeps your yield high, your quality process very high, and you’re super agile if there’s any change or change in your production because you have a different version you want to produce. It’s super smart, and it doesn’t take a week to reassemble your line, but it really goes automatically.

When you talk about industrial agents… So there are some lines, something’s gone wrong, a warning light goes off, and you say an agent will help you figure out what’s wrong and potentially fix it by itself. Is that based on an LLM? Are you using one of the models from one of the big companies, and it’s just an LLM that you’ve trained to think about a line in that way?

Yep, but not only that. It’s based on an LLM, different ones, depending on which one we are working on and different use cases, but it’s based on an LLM, but it’s not good enough. If you only use an LLM or an LLM-based agent to fix a problem, the hit rate is near what we need, but we are training these LLMs on our data, on proprietary data, product data, machine data, and operation data. Once you have that, and even the data of fixes in the past ... Remember, when you’d walk a [manufacturing] plant, and you’d see the whiteboard where a supervisor writes, “I have a problem here, this is who is working on it, and here I fixed it.” All that knowledge goes into this model so that you just say, “Okay, this is the pattern of a problem. This is what the fix was.” The model knows it because we upload the data.

So it’s a model that is trained. This is why we talk about an industrial AI model, which is trained on industrial data. Fundamental, if it really runs across, but also very specific, if it comes to certain machines, then the hit rate goes up from 60 percent, 70 percent, to the 95-ish/8-ish plus, which is really what you can do then.

Are these your models that you’re training, or are you augmenting models you’re taking?

We are augmenting. We don’t do LLMs, so really large models that are trained on the whole of knowledge in the world. This we don’t do [in house]. This is what we’re using any kind of, for specific tasks. We have some models which are very good in software, copilots, and agents for software. And now we are working on really genuine and new product designs, not only just having the next code line, but really genuine designs, a completely different world. And in some cases, we’re working on copilots on the shop floor. We talk about Microsoft, for example, and we are having the first use cases doing that. So, challenges, of course, are that an industrial AI application doesn’t accept hallucination. You really have to be sure that once you send an agent out, it does what you want it to do.

This is my fundamental question, and I’ve asked a lot of people this. I’m very curious about your perspective, because the domain is so different. I am not convinced that LLM technology, as it exists today, can make the leap to do all of the things that people want it to do. You see the gaps. Even as you’re saying, an LLM on its own hallucinates enough to only be effective 60 percent to 70 percent of the time. That’s nowhere near good enough for all of the things people want it to do — especially at the labor replacement rates that some of these folks talk about. Do you think it’s good enough, or do you think it’s the actual augmentation that makes it, the products that you build with it, good?

And actually, I’m also going to ask the second part of that question. Do you see LLM technology, the core technology, improving at a rate that might change your assessment of it?

Good point. To the question, LLMs will get better and better, but I don’t believe that these LLMs, if you do not train them really on specific industrial data, and this is where the augmentation comes from… You can train them as well, and as long as we want, but they will not get to the level that we can use on the shop floor. It will not work. I strongly believe that the LLMs need specific, domain-specific, machine-specific data in order to really make a difference. But then, if you do that, then you really can make a step up, which is fundamentally higher. I can give you two examples, which are maybe interesting. One is an optical inspection task where we used an LLM and said, “Okay, show me the problem.” Hit rate was okay-ish, but not to the level we needed. Then we start training the model with not so much data, which is anyhow important because if you’re manufacturing at a PPM level, guess how many mistakes you get a day? But on those that you have made, you then create some synthetic data around those.

Once you train the model, your hit rate goes up substantially. It’s much, much higher than if you use the next best and next best models. Is there convergence? To some extent, I do believe there’s a certain ceiling where you can train as well as you want, but if you do not get specific training, then you have a problem. Now, my second example is, and now I will give you a little bit of the spirit of how deep you have to go… We have an Italian manufacturer, they make robots, a crib in the box, a crib in the box for any kind of parts. And obviously, you can train a robot to make this crib in a box. What we did was create this wholly in the digital world. We used a digital part with a digital arm, digital software, a digital camera, and maybe everything, and we trained a robot over and over again on this crib in the box with our technology. And then we switched it on, and the hit rate was still not satisfying, 70-odd level.

It’s amazing now because we trained for hundreds of hours virtually. Then we used Nvidia technology with a photorealistic ray tracing of these pieces, photorealistic ray tracing at different lights, and trained the model over again. The hit rate was jumping up substantially. So these little details of having a normal representation of a digital part and a really photorealistic one made the hit rate come up substantially. And this is also the reason why when you train robots now in the virtual world, it doesn’t really work. There’s a reason we have so many people who are standing there with some handles and training robots to do a job and train over and over and over again, because this is real training on the real stuff. And these little details make a difference between an industrial application and one that you cannot use. What I’m saying is that training models on specific data, on valuable design data, operation data, and time series data, brings them to the level that we need in order to deploy them.

All that data has to come from lots of different customers, and you talk about Siemens as having all that data. But that data actually belongs to your customers. Are they willing to let you aggregate so that you can develop the products at the scale that you’re talking about?

So don’t underestimate the amount of data we have. I talk about generations of design data for controls, for trains, for switches, and whatnot, number one. Number two is that we have, I don’t know, how many thousands of machines we are operating. We have machines, we have machine jobs, machining jobs. But if we then go to my AI guys, they say, “Okay, you make everything available now from Siemens?” Then they say, “Ah, still not enough.” They need so much data to train models. Now we have an alliance for machine builders, German machine builders, nine of them. I mean top, top, top. These are the names, Trumpf, DMG Mori, and the like; they are ready now to share their data with us to train models, to bring them a model that they can use to make an application that makes their machines run autonomously.

So you just say, “This is the part, here’s the machine, and just get going.” They know that their data is not very useful because it’s too little, but if you add up, if you create these data alliances, it works. It requires a certain trust. This is again where Siemens comes in because they trust us. We have been partners for decades now. We are very mindful of that one. So you’re right, you need as much data as possible. You need as much proprietary data as possible. Would they share the data of their absolute latest machine with us? No, but don’t need that. It can use all the other ones, which is absolutely helpful.

Let me wrap up with just a big picture question here. I’m just thinking about Siemens as a company and what it represents, and all the places it is around the world, and the value of this scale. You have 320,000 people in all the places around the world. And then I just think about the barriers going up. And Siemens is a defense contractor for both the United States government and Europe, and a bunch of other countries around the world. Are you planning for an event as catastrophic as the dissolution of NATO? It’s great to be like, we can aggregate all the data from all our customers, but also the world might fall apart. Are you thinking about Siemens as a global company in that context?

Yes, we do. If you ask me, do we make a kind of scenario planning of another war or whatever, some incident in Taiwan, we don’t really, because I told my people we cannot do that over and over again. It comes in different forms. So, therefore, why would you? Stay agile and be really fast if something happens. So this is one thing. On the other side, we see obviously the trends in the world, and we are working more and more on what we call the forging of technologies. So, local for local, that you do not always rely on certain technologies from the United States used in China for China and the United States, or for Europe. So it’s a pity because normally you would like to scale, and we still have core technologies which we can multiply, but obviously, getting ... For example, we are training our industrial AI applications for China on Chinese LLMs, whereas for the United States, obviously, we train them on American hyperscalers or whatever, LLMs.

So we have good experiences also, and this makes us more resilient. Can I do that for everything? Can I fork all my software? I could, but it’s just prohibitively expensive; it doesn’t make sense. But for certain areas, we do that and increase our resilience and hope for the best.

I realize I’m ending on a down note here, but it just seems like so much of what you’re excited about is the opportunity of scale, the opportunity to do these things cooperatively, in a way that maybe changes the world economy, and all of us are just caring for robots in the end. But these are huge global ideas that you have, and I’m just trying to put them in the context of, boy, when I hear other people talk about AI, it is in the context of national champions and international competition in a way that feels very old.

It does not feel like the world of the past 20 years. This feels like a return to a different time. And I’m just wondering how you can keep the optimism of the scale and the globalization when that is happening all around you.

Maybe I have this optimism because I’m working in one of the most international companies in the world. We are a Chinese company, as we are a United States company and a European one, and we have so many great people all around the world. And I’ll also see how they are collaborating, and I believe that this is a core value of societies, which is super, super relevant for the future. There might be times where this is not appreciated so much for whatever reason, but in the long run, I believe that a world which is using technologies in order to solve the real problems in the world ... We have to feed 10 billion people now. We are creating our climate and whatnot. And we have aging societies where healthcare is a huge problem. So we cannot solve it if we box ourselves too small, so scale it. And here I hope that when we have waves of opening and closing and whatnot, that ultimately this pays out if you are acting in a global international network as we do, and therefore I’m more optimistic.

What should we be looking for next from Siemens?

I think the next thing is that we are walking the talk. We talk about that we are building this industrial AI operating system, that we are using AI now for the next level to really not only validate, but also create, that we are leveraging our capabilities of bringing the real world and the digital world together, because the digital world can do so much if you do not have an impact on the real world. We show that with our customers, like PepsiCo, which was showing at CES, like Kyron, the supply chain or logistics company, or many, many others. And to see that we can be the entry door for AI technology into the real world together with our partners at scale.

Roland, this has been great. I could do another full hour just on the structure of Siemens. I think, as you can tell.

You’re going to have to come back. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

The ads will appear in a separate area beneath your chat.

OpenAI plans to start testing ads in ChatGPT today, according to a report from CNBC. The “clearly labeled” ads will appear in a separate area beneath your chat, OpenAI announced last month.

A source close to the situation tells CNBC that OpenAI “expects ads to make up less than half of its revenue long term.” Last week, Anthropic showed off a Super Bowl commercial poking fun at OpenAI, saying “ads are coming to AI,” but not to its AI chatbot Claude. The version of the ad that aired during the game was a little less direct after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the campaign “clearly dishonest.”

OpenAI will show ads to logged-in users who use the app for free or subscribe to its cheaper Go subscription. The company says it will “keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers,” but notes that the ads will still be “optimized based on what’s most helpful to you.” Advertisers won’t have an impact on ChatGPT’s answers, according to OpenAI.

In an internal memo seen by CNBC, Altman tells employees that OpenAI plans to launch an updated chat model this week, coming just days after the company released a more advanced version of its AI coding agent, Codex. Altman also reportedly said that ChatGPT is “back to exceeding 10% monthly growth.” OpenAI last reported having 800 million weekly users last October.

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on. “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Correction: Kovant is based in Sweden, not Germany. The article has been updated.

Update: The article has also been edited to clarify the source of the claims about the Moltbook post that Karpathy shared on X.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.
